GRAHAM SAYS POLITICAL CLERICS 'WENT TOO FAR',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/us/graham-says-political-clerics-went-too-far.html,The Rev Billy Graham said yesterday that some of his fellow Christian ministers and evangelists went too far by getting involved in partisan politics in the 1984 Presidential elections In the political arena I think there were pastors and evangelists who went too far from my point of view both from the left and from the right he said He mentioned among others the Rev Jerry Falwell the head of Moral Majority who was a strong supporter of President Reagan and the Rev Jesse Jackson who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Presidential nomination However Mr Graham said If that is the way they feel led to do Im not going to debate with them My own position is that I will not get involved in partisan politics he said Role Urged on Social Issues At the same time the 66yearold Baptist preacher added that evangelists did have a duty to get involved in social issues In appearances both in the United States and the Soviet Union over the last three years Mr Graham has made nuclear disarmament my No 1 social concern For most of the 1984 Presidential campaign Mr Graham was traveling on what he called a worldwide Christian crusade His stops included England South Korea and the Soviet Union Mr Graham the preeminent American Christian evangelist for decades made his comments on the election in an interview yesterday in his room at Marriotts Essex House He returned to his home in Montreat NC last night after a brief visit to New York By his own count Mr Graham has been an intimate of seven Presidents His friendship with Richard M Nixon was probably the most widely publicized He often conducted religious services at the Nixon White House and served as an occasional adviser to Mr Nixon However Mr Graham said intimacy with Presidents should not be confused with a partisan position Friendship With Nixon I suppose that there was a time that it was assumed because of a friendship with a President that I got involved in partisan politics Mr Graham said in reference to Mr Nixon But I really have never endorsed a political candidate and do not intend to in the future He added that he and his wife Ruth had been close family friends of President Reagan and his wife Nancy for 30 years And yet he added President Reagan and Vice President Bush would never expect me to take sides with them or endorse them I disagree with a lot of their policies he said Over the last three years Mr Graham has set himself apart from many American evangelists by stressing the nuclear war issue In the interview yesterday he said that he agreed with conservative evangelists that abortion should be outlawed and that prayer in the schools should be permitted But he added I am more interested in the peace issue than I am in some of the other issues that evoke so much emotion I doubt theyll ever have an amendment on the abortion issue he added I doubt if theyll ever have an amendment on the prayer issue I dont think theyre going to fool with the Constitution In the area of nuclear war he said the church had the greatest opportunity and challenge that it has ever had Concern About Nuclear Threat More people in the world today are searching for God than at any time in human history he said They all feel this nuclear threat that hangs over them Another focus for Mr Graham in recent years has been the training of evangelists Some 5000 evangelists from around the world attended a conference he sponsored in Amsterdam in 1983 He said he expected twice as many at a conference in 1986 Mr Graham whose 12 books have sold more than 12 million copies has just completed a new book Standards for the Evangelist In the book he said Ive tried to lift the standard of the evangelist Sometimes the standards drop below what I think are biblical standards The book is about how to preach the Gospel how to conduct finances in a responsible manner and about the limits of political involvement Mr Graham called the new evangelists my successors but he said that he had no plans to slow down or retire Im not going to quit preaching until God stops me he said
U.S. ASSERTS CLINIC BOMBINGS AREN'T WORK OF SINGLE GROUP,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/us/us-asserts-clinic-bombings-aren-t-work-of-single-group.html,Treasury Department officials said today that they believed the recent cases of arson and bombing at abortion clinics represented the work of individuals rather than an organized conspiracy Solving the cases would probably be easier if there was a single group said John M Walker Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for enforcement and operations The Treasurys Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms is leading the Federal investigation Family planning groups feminist organizations and abortion clinics however have grown increasingly disturbed at the Governments response to violence against clinics The FBI reports 30 attacks on such clinics since May 1982 Many have criticized the Reagan Administration which is strongly antiabortion for not harshly condemning the violence They have also criticized the Administration for not ordering an allout nationwide investigation Isolated People Depicted What we have are isolated people who are passionately antiabortion who are resorting to violence Mr Walker said But there has been no incident where a national organization or national conspiracy has been identified Jack Killorin a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms said the conclusion that no single organization was involved was based not on assumptions but on having made arrests in 12 of the 30 incidents of violence In any investigation he added you want to make sure you dont let anyone slide away so you investigate very carefully to learn as much as possible about the persons arrested their associations who they may be connected to When you dont find anyone you determine they acted alone If there were a national conspiracy wed say there is one If we needed help wed say hey we need help Webster Explains Stand The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation William H Webster has said that the bureau has not become intensively involved because the bombings are not regarded as terrorist The bombings Mr Webster said do not signify an attack on Government Those who are disturbed by Mr Websters statements have said there was a possibility of a nationwide organization calling itself Army of God The name is sometimes used by people claiming responsibility for bombings The name was used after the 1982 bombings of clinics in Florida and Virginia for which three men have been convicted Donald Benny Anderson and Wayne and Matthew Moore Don Anderson and the Moore brothers hit in Virginia Florida and Illinois Mr Killorin said so it really looked like there was a blossom of activity in different parts of the country until they were arrested Since then he added investigators have concluded that those three men made up the entire Army of God Responsibility for the Case Mr Walker also said that responsibility for the solving the bombings belonged to the alcohol tobacco and firearms bureau which has given the problem its top priority The authorities would not provide a profile of the types of people arrested in the cases so far Generally speaking they said the suspects appeared to have fundamentalist religious convictions and were zealous in opposing abortion Of the 30 recent incidents three occurred in 1982 two in 1983 24 in 1984 and one so far this year There have also been more than 100 reports of vandalism or harassment causing some clinics to close Those Who Have Been Arrested These are the arrests in the 12 violent acts listed by the Government  Three incidents Mr Anderson and the Moore brothers the first to use the name Army of God were convicted for the May 29 1982 bombings at the Womens Health Center in St Petersburg Fla the Bread and Roses Clinic in Clearwater Fla and the June 6 1982 bombing at the ArlingtonFairfax Medical Center in Virginia  One incident Joseph Grace was convicted for the May 26 1983 fire bombing at the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk Va He described himself as a member of the Army of God but later said he was not a member and had seen the name in a newspaper  Four incidents Matthew John Goldsby a 21yearold construction worker has been charged with bombing three abortion clinics in Pensacola Fla on Dec 25 1984 and a bombing of one of the same clinics on June 25 Federal agents also arrested James Thomas Simmons 21 also of Cantonment his wife Kathy and Mr Goldsbys fiancee Kaye Wiggins in three of the bombings Mr Simmons said he had been called upon by God to destroy the clinics  Four incidents Curtis Anton Baseda an unemployed roofer confessed to bombings at four clinics in Washington State from December 1983 to April 1984 and told authorities he had acted alone Mr Baseda was sentenced to 20 years The most recent bombing occurred Monday at an abortion clinic in Washington DC A group identifying itself as the East Coast Division of the Army of God called The Washington Times to claim responsibility and demanded that the newspaper print a statement expressing support for Mr Goldsby

REAGAN CONDEMNS ARSON AT CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/us/reagan-condemns-arson-at-clinics.html,President Reagan today condemned the recent rash of bombings at abortion clinics around the country as violent anarchist activities and pledged to see that the perpetrators were brought to justice He did not order any change in the way the inquiry was being pursued Mr Reagans remarks in a statement released by the White House were his first on the series of attacks on legal abortion clinics in two years The Administration has been faced with growing criticism from abortion rights and civil liberties groups who have accused Federal officials of not vigorously investigating the attacks In its statement today the White House added its voice to other Administration assurances that all the necessary steps were being taken to stop such incidents I Will Do All in My Power I condemn in the strongest terms those individuals who perpetrate these and all such violent anarchist activities Mr Reagan said As President of the United States I will do all in my power to assure that the guilty are brought to justice Lawenforcement officials have placed the number of attacks on abortion clinics at 24 in 1984 and at 30 since May 1982 Mr Reagan while reflecting high level Administration concern to the attacks did not order a change in the Federal investigative method in the cases Thus far the primary burden lies with the Treasury Departments Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms which has jurisdiction in crimes involving explosives and bombings The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said that the attacks do not constitute terrorism nor an attack on the Government situations that fall under the jurisdiction of the FBI The Presidents silence on the attacks until now and his refusal to order the FBIinto the investigation had prompted complaints that the Administration was not doing all it could Mr Reagan sought to answer those charges with his statement which was unusually harsh in tone He Will Press Smith on Case Mr Reagan said he would ask Attorney General William French Smith to see that all Federal agencies with jurisdiction pursue the investigation vigorously However Marlin Fitzwater deputy White House press secretary said that Mr Reagan was not calling for a change and that the primary responsibility would continue to rest with Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms of the Treasury Department However he said the FBI will appoint an agent to serve as a liaison to the alcohol tobacco and firearms bureau But that would be to insure that the FBI provides whatever assistance is needed and not to alter the process he said In a separate statement released later condemning the attacks Attorney General Smith said that he had asked Mr Webster to take steps to insure that the FBI is providing all possible assistance Mr Smith oversees the FBI part of the Justice Department So far Mr Smith said the FBI has been assisting by providing psychological profiling of suspects fingerprint checks and criminal record checks Mr Smith and White House officials in other comments endorsed the capacities of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms pointing out that 12 of 30 recent cases had been solved with eight people arrested and five convicted The other investigations are continuing No one has been injured in the attacks Washington Mayors Criticism The most recent incident occurred earlier this week at a womens clinic here The attack prompted sharp criticism from Mayor Marion Barry of Washington who demanded that the Administration bring the FBI in Mr Reagan was criticized today by the National Organization for Women which said in a telegram that the incidents represented a campaign of terrorism and intimidation against American women exercising their constitutional right to obtain health care including abortion if they so choose The organization asked that Mr Reagan who opposes abortion publicly condemn the terrorist acts in the same strong terms you condemn the attacks of international terrorists upon American citizens Another organization the National Right to Life Committee an antiabortion group endorsed Mr Reagans condemnation of the attacks saying that the violence was inconsistent with their movement If we were to adopt the evil tactics of those who promote abortion by using violence ourselves we would destroy the very ethic that is the foundation of our prolife movement said the groups president John C Willke

THE NATION;,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/weekinreview/the-nation-197346.html,Bomb Attacks onAbortion ClinicsAnger Reagan For the 30th time since May 1982 an abortion clinic was bombed last week It prompted an angry statement from President Reagan who condemned the blasts as violent anarchist activities but also brought fresh criticism that his Administration wasnt making enough of a Federal case out of the attacks The latest target was a Washington DC clinic and Mr Reagan a staunch opponent of abortion promised to do all in my power to assure that the guilty are brought to justice But while he said he would ask Attorney General William French Smith to see that all Federal agencies with jurisdiction pursue the investigation vigorously a White House spokesman said that the Treasury Departments Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms would continue to have primary responsibility for the probe Family planning groups and feminist organizations have called for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to step in but apart from providing psychological profiles of suspects and information on fingerprints and criminal records the FBI has been on the sidelines Federal officials noted that 12 of the cases have thus far been solved with eight people arrested and five convicted Last weeks blast caused extensive damage but no deaths or injuries Investigators insisted there was no evidence linking it to any of the others though a caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the Army of God a name that has cropped up in attacks elsewhere in the country The caller also offered encouragement for John Goldsby our brother in Florida apparently referring to Matthew J Goldsby one of four people charged last week in the bombings of several Pensacola abortion clinics The suspects were described by a defense lawyer Paul Shimek Jr as upright and cleanliving citizens They said God spoke to them and they did what they did to save innocent lives of unborn children Mr Shimek said United States Magistrate Robert Crongeyer called the bombings acts of terrorism and bail was denied to two of the defendants
NORTH CAROLINA BUSTLES WITH PEOPLE AND MONEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/us/north-carolina-bustles-with-people-and-money.html,A few days before todays inauguration of James G Martin as Governor of North Carolina a nationally known moving company reported a small but telling fact that helps illustrate this states happy economic bustle The Mayflower Corporation said it had handled nearly twice as many moves into North Carolina more than 2500 as moves out of the state in the first nine months of 1984 As the retiring Governor James B Hunt Jr prepared to make way for his successor he issued figures underscoring the point In the past eight years industries invested 155 billion in new and expanded plants in North Carolina he said producing 250000 additional jobs Over the last decade the work force has grown by 15 percent according to Michael Rakouskas research chief of the State Department of Commerce and today the state is well on its way to recovering fully from the 1981 national recession Mr Martin is taking over a largely rural state but one that is undergoing enormous economic transition The state that produced the dark writings of Thomas Wolfe and the folksiness of the actor Andy Griffith still grows more tobacco than any other state still holds a hollering contest every year for the mountain folk at Spiveys Corner and still celebrates Mule Day in Benson to honor that fine farm animal Worry Over Subsidies But Congress is threatening to do away with the Federal tobacco subsidy program and tobacco growers are worried along with the smalltown residents who one way or another depend on tobacco income And employment in the textile industry has dropped to its lowest point since 1947 as textile employers abandon the South for foreign lands where workers settle for lower wages And yet North Carolina has begun to shift like other Southern states to a more modern and diversified economy A number of machinery manufacturers attracted by the low cost of land and construction have moved here And the state has recruited several major computer concerns from Californias hightechnology area to its 40 million microelectronics center at Research Triangle Park situated near three respected universities Duke the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State Today Mr Martin who campaigned on an probusiness platform repeated his emphasis on economic development after taking the oath of office on a Bible given him by his wife Dottie when they were childhood sweethearts Yes I am for business he told the throng in downtown Raleigh We all must be Thats where jobs come from I believe in the principle of selfreliance Merit Plan for Teachers At the same time however Mr Martin also promised he would carry on in the tradition of the states proeducation Governors He has proposed a 300 million merit pay increase for teachers He also noted the economic and political progress blacks and women have made in the state Having appointed three Democrats one black and one woman to his 10member cabinet he spoke of the need for unity and good will among the citizens of the state To sustain economic growth Mr Martin has proposed tax cuts designed primarily to attract more business to North Carolina He is expected to encounter heavy opposition however from Democratic leaders who argue that the state cannot afford the loss of revenue As only the second Republican to win the governorship in this century Mr Martin scored an upset over Attorney General Rufus L Edmisten A chemistry professor the new Governor spent the last 12 years in Congress where he became an ardent advocate of President Reagans supplyside economics Some governmental experts do not expect him to sharply change the course of Government charted by Mr Hunt a moderate Democrat MiddleIncome Appeal The difference between moderate Democrats and conservative Republicans down here is not that great said Merle Black a political scientist at the University of North Carolina Mr Black described the new Governor as a savvy pragmatic tough conservative politician State Republican organizations have long been weak in the South but Mr Black predicted that Mr Martin could go a long way toward changing that in North Carolina Because his candidacy had such broad appeal to middleincome voters Mr Black predicted He will do more to build a strong Republican Party than anyone else they could have come up with Mr Martin departed from the path of other Republican aspirants for state office Mr Black said by refraining from appealing to racism In that sense his campaign was one of several indications of the growing sophistication on racial matters in North Carolina and in the South generally in recent years He is not a racial divider like Jesse Helms said Mr Black referring to the states senior Senator who was re elected last November after a bitter campaign against his Democratic opponent Governor Hunt Martin will bring young middleclass whites into the Republican Party The Democrats are losing their base and they dont know what to do Martin could be a real turning point in North Carolina politics Democrats Control Legislature For the first time the Governor and both of the states Senators Mr Helms and John P East are Republicans Yet Democrats hold sway in the Legislature and registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 3 to 1 Of the states 327 million voters 69 percent are Democrats 26 percent Republicans and 4 to 5 percent are independents Both Senators are well known for their conservatism Mr Martin is viewed as less doctrinaire than Mr Helms but he said he would seek an end to state financing of elective abortions except in cases of medical necessity rape and incest North Carolina provides more than 1 million annually to poor women who choose abortion one of the few states in the country to do so With a population that is 25 percent nonwhite North Carolina went through its share of integration struggles in the 1960s and 1970s In a landmark decision in 1971 the Supreme Court upheld courtordered busing to achieve integration in the CharlotteMecklenburg County school district as a means to dismantle the dual school systems of the South The district had been the first in the country to undertake such a plan When President Reagan campaigned for Mr Martin and Senator Helms in Charlotte last fall he seemed to refer to the old controversy as he charged that busing takes innocent children out of the neighborhood school and makes them pawns in a social experiment that nobody wants and we found out that it failed The partisan throng greeted the Presidents statement with silence and The Charlotte Observer a highly respected newspaper responded in an editorial the next day Charlotte Mecklenburgs proudest achievement of the past 20 years is not the citys impressive new skyline or its strong growing economy the paper said Its proudest achievement is its fully integrated public school system Settled 400 Years Ago Indeed residents of Charlotte hail the outcome While a few private academies did spring up white parents basically accepted the plan and did not take their children out of local schools In addition Charlotte voters elected a black Mayor Harvey Gantt in November 1983 North Carolina has just begun celebrating the 400th anniversary of its settlement In 1585 and 1587 Sir Walter Raleigh sent English settlers to the region The first group returned the second vanished and with it went Virginia Dare the first child of English parentage born in the New World In time English settlers moved into the region from Virginia to plant tobacco and make their fortunes The colony prospered and was admitted to the union in 1789 as the 12th state In the Civil War North Carolina reluctantly joined the Confederate side After suffering more casualties than any other state it was readmitted to the Union in 1868 At least two Presidents have come from North Carolina James K Polk and Andrew Johnson whose house in Raleigh has been moved so often that local residents joke it is the nations oldest mobile home North Carolina also claims Andrew Jackson who was born in a settlement on the South Carolina border as a native son But South Carolina with the support of many scholars has disputed that
Falwell Says Bombers Are 'Deranged' People,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/us/falwell-says-bombers-are-deranged-people.html,Jerry Falwell the leader of Moral Majority says the bombings of abortion clinics are being carried out by deranged people who are diverting attention from the real atrocity The worst thing anyone who genuinely supports the dignity of life can do is be involved in a violent act he told reporters at a news conference Friday Mr Falwell and other leaders of antiabortion organizations have come under criticism recently as not speaking out strongly against the bombings of abortion clinics Lawenforcement officials have said there were 24 attacks on abortion clinics in 1984 On Thursday President Reagan condemned the rash of bombings and ordered an allout Federal effort to find those responsible The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been criticized because it says the bombings do not fit its definition of terrorism and places a lower priority on them than on things it considers terrorist acts Mr Falwell issued a plea to those involved in the bombings saying Dont do some dastardly thing that will set the prolife movement back to the Stone Age Clinic Defense League Set Up HEMPSTEAD LI Jan 5 AP  An operator of abortion clinics said Friday he was starting a National Pro Choice Defense League to hire detectives to track down those who bomb abortion clinics and harass patients Bill Baird operator of abortion clinics in Hauppauge Hempstead and Boston warned antiabortion activists who resort to violence You dare invade the health and wellbeing of our patients and it will be a fight to the death No longer will we tolerate the lawlessness in the name of God
Topics ;    For Life Careful Condemnation,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/opinion/topics-for-life-careful-condemnation.html,After 30 bombings of abortion clinics including six in the Washington area President Reagan has finally spoken out in denunciation but he chose his words carefully He condemned the bombers violent anarchist activities thereby distinguishing himself from the National Organization for Women which has called the bombings a campaign of terrorism and intimidation against women seeking to exercise a constitutional right Whatever the Presidents choice of words the condemnation is welcome But does the distinction between anarchy and terrorism make a difference Yes in one practical sense By recognizing the bombings as acts of terrorism Mr Reagan might have seemed to overrule William Webster Director of the FBI who has declined to take the lead investigative role The bombings dont qualify as terrorism directed against the Government he said so they fall more appropriately within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms But theres another difference Anarchy implies violent opposition to authority for the simple reason that it is authority Terrorism implies violent promotion of intolerant intolerable zeal An Administration proud of its opposition to abortion bears a special obligation to condemn and pursue all who destroy in the name of life Whether or not you call the bombers terrorists their method is plain enough terror
SACRAMENTAL ENCOUNTERS ALL OVER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/books/sacramental-encounters-all-over.html,Raymond A Schroth SJ is the dean of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester Mass HOW TO SAVE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  By Andrew M Greeley and Mary Greeley Durkin 258 pp New York Elizabeth Sifton BooksViking 1695  O NE gray Chicago afternoon the Rev Andrew M Greeley making his way down Michigan Avenue was feeling mighty low Then a young mother on a bus had him hold her baby for a second and smiled at him I have seen a Madonna he bubbled to his dinner companion The encounter was a sacrament She had saved his day The question is whether this moment prolonged in the telling here for four pages can serve as the basis for a whole book which in turn can save the Catholic Church According to Father Greeley a professor of sociology at the University of Arizona and a bestselling novelist and his sister Mary Greeley Durkin the author of Feast of Love a study of Pope John Paul IIs lectures on sexuality the Catholic Church in America is in trouble In administering the reforms of Vatican II discarding much of the piety and discipline that stood between itself and modernity  prayers to guardian angels blessings of automobiles and the Latin mass  the church seems to have jettisoned much of its identity as well Furthermore its male clerical power structure oppresses women the authors say its leaders still fear healthy sexuality the professional liturgists have made the mass more tedious with irrelevant longwinded longer than 10 minutes homilies and unsingable pseudofolk songs the church does nothing to foster the arts Catholic scholarship has dried up and Notre Dame which has the resources to lead makes the limp excuse that it is concentrating on undergraduates The authors antidote for this malaise is a recovery of the Catholic sensibility a way of looking at everyday experience particularly sexual experience as sacramental as revelatory of God Catholicism they argue must nurture intimacy in marriage which can mean birth control revitalize parish life with pastors who are hopeful holy men who smile and bring back some old pious traditions like St Christopher medals  even though St Christopher didnt exist with new stories to make them meaningful They even suggest the important theologian of angels the film director Steven Spielberg brings us a sacrament in ET  One reasonable response to all this is to deny that Catholicism has lost any of its essential spirit but rather has been purified by the postVatican II changes Another is to grant the truth in much of the authors indictment  particularly of injustice toward women  and the validity of their central idea The principle of finding God in all things is at the heart of Western spirituality expressed in the 16th century by St Ignatius Loyola in his Spiritual Exercises a series of meditations that teach us how to discern Gods will and presence in everyday events Yet emphasis on personal experience as an indication of the divine presence is also part of the Protestant tradition from Jonathan Edwards to the New England transcendentalists To make this insight unique to the Catholic sensibility hardly does justice to mainstream American religious thought Nor does calling every act of love  from a sexual embrace to changing diapers  a sacrament necessarily enhance the value of the act which is already the occasion of grace or enrich theological language which usually refers to sacraments as moments when as the late German theologian Karl Rahner said the church involves itself totally in the decisive situations of human life The authors polemical method is a combination of the balloon and the club send up a beautiful idea  the church should support the arts  then clobber the fools who havent accepted it They imagine that there are still church officials who object to nudity in oil paintings and they cant resist one more swing at Father Greeleys nemesis the late Cardinal Cody of Chicago who years ago failed to boost a Chicago Lyric Opera production of Paradise Lost by Polands Krzysztof Penderecki whom the authors call perhaps the greatest living Catholic musician  More significant in a book that purports to chart the future of Catholicism is its silence on the socalled life issues  nuclear disarmament abortion capital punishment race world hunger social and economic justice It may be that certain bishops have squandered their moral credibility during the churchstate debate in the recent Presidential election But the church leadership with all its faults has decided in open dialogue that the way to save the church is to commit it to the struggle for human survival The authors who have nothing substantive to say about arms control or economic justice and consider the bomb and the third world as fads take broad swipes at unnamed liberation theologians and assail as incompetents the Catholic bishops staff members who wrote the recent letters on nuclear arms and the economy In the long run however it is not important for the church itself to be saved It is important for the Catholic Church as it is for the entire people of God to live and die to itself as Christ did in the service of the world It is difficult to see how a church turned in upon itself  on the Madonnas smile the joy of sex and angel visitors from space  will be worthy of that task B
ALBANY TO FOCUS ON CUTTING TAXES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/nyregion/albany-to-focus-on-cutting-taxes.html,Tax cuts  who will get them and who will get political credit for them  will preoccupy lawmakers in Albany this year according to Governor Cuomo and leaders of the Legislature There is a consensus among politicians that the 208th session of the Legislature which opens Wednesday will bring some lightening of New Yorkers tax burden with the focus on changes in the income tax The lawmakers will also deal with other matters including plans to reduce the states debt and to finance programs with what officials expect to be a sizable budget surplus The Governors legislative program which will be detailed in his State of the State Message on Wednesday will likely include these proposals according to Mr Cuomo and other officials  A rise in welfare payments The Governors support for a rise was signaled in a letter from Mr Cuomo to Archbishop John J OConnor who has urged an increase Higher payments to the poor should accompany a cut in taxes for the middle class the Governor wrote adding I hope we will have your strong support for both  Borrowing millions of dollars against expected surpluses from the Battery Park City Authority and using the money for housing for the poor and the homeless The idea came from the authoritys president Meyer S Frucher  A state initiative to raise teacher salaries There could be some kind of targeted aid to encourage local governments to improve teachers pay Mr Cuomo said  Rebuilding the state superfund to clean toxicwaste sites Therell be a big big hit on this Mr Cuomo said Taxes however will be the Legislatures biggest concern Tax reduction will be the dominant issue said Warren M Anderson the leader of the Senates Republican majority Its definitely affordable and its at least a year overdue His counterpart on the Democratic side of the Senate aisle the minority leader Manfred Ohrenstein pointed to the politics that will be involved The money is there he said the questions are How much should we do in tax cuts How much should we do in other things Cleaning Up the Tax Code Stanley Fink the Assembly Speaker and a Democrat said that tax cuts should be joined with cleaning up the state tax code Overall he said I think this is going to be a good year When theres money around he said you can do a lot of good things Clarence D Rappleyea leader of the Assemblys Republican minority said that the Governors budget people would have an awful lot of working room and that there would be a tax cut The form its going to take is kind of cloudy he added Legislative leaders suggested that there was little likelihood of early action on anything not tied to the budget which the Governor will propose on Jan 22 and the Legislature is supposed to enact before the start of the next fiscal year April 1 But they said a variety of topics would be dealt with before the Senate and the Assembly went home They cited energy issues the re enactment  after tinkering  of New York City housing laws changes in school aid and the curbing of judges discretion in criminal sentencing And they foresaw the resurrection of some topics that are politically sensitive These include the annual argument over the death penalty the Governors stalled proposal for a state Equal Rights Amendment for women a possible move to bow to Federal pressure to enact a drinking age of 21 and what is thought to be an inevitable 1985 replay of one of 1984s noisiest disputes  the seatbelt argument Enacted last year the law requiring drivers and frontseat passengers to wear seat belts prompted a public outcry that politicians say is certain to produce a repeal effort this year The Governor sitting in shirtsleeves behind his desk in the World Trade Center the other day said he had no intention of alluding in his State of the State Message to speculation about his potential role as a Democratic candidate for President But he began the conversation about what might happen in Albany in 1985 by noting that the public often did not realize the difficulties posed by the political situation there  with a Democratic Governor and Assembly and a Republican Senate It requires constant negotiation and compromise he said adding If you can make that work you can make the country work He repeated one of his favorite alliterations in outlining the governmental year Compassion and common sense he said will characterize his programs The first focus will be finances Soon after settling in on Tuesday and reelecting their leaders legislators will turn to the two sides of the budget spending and taxes That will dominate the first three months Mr Ohrenstein predicted I doubt youre going to get any issue of any great importance until thats done These are among the issues that will confront the lawmakers Taxes and Debt The last time I saw this kind of spread was in 74 Mr Rappleyea said of tax and expense extrapolations that show state surpluses for the next few years The Governor has promised to propose tax cuts and prodded by Comptroller Edward V Regan a Republican to start whittling down more than 4 billion in shortterm debt built up under the policy of juggling bills between fiscal years There is a dispute however over how to do it Mr Anderson and other Senate Republican leaders opened the tax bargaining with a detailed 15 billion 5year package of cuts identical to one the Governor rejected last year They proposed doubling personal incometax exemptions to 1000 lowering the top rate a point to 9 percent and adjusting each bracket upward by 1000 to offset inflationpowered bracket creep Mr Fink said that eliminating anomalies in the current tax code could generate money beyond the predicted surpluses Combine it all and youve got a new ball game he said Housing and the Homeless Up for discussion early will be the proposal to borrow against projected Battery Park surpluses to finance housing for the poor and the homeless The Partnership for the Homeless a religious coalition called the concept a Big MAC for housing akin to the Municipal Assistance Corporation which borrows for the city Later in the session New York Citys tangle of housing laws will come up for renewal Energy and Utilities Energys going to have to be dealt with and its more than just Shoreham said Mr Rappleyea Last years legislative session was supposed to focus on energy but did not a Federal court decision deferred the deadline for decision on allocation of cheap hydropower But that plus what to do about the stillunopened Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island and a proposed power line through the Catskills will have to be decided eventually Also on legislators minds are various plans to reorganize utility regulation New York City Last month the City Budget Director Alair A Townsend put out a booklet with a picture of the Statue of Liberty and a headline Sharing the Burden New York Citys Case for State Aid It stressed the citys main objective in Albany money But Claudia Wagner the Koch administrations state lobbyist noted a number of other concerns including controls on childcare workers limits on lawsuits against the city and a variety of criminaljustice measures Environment The big dispute is how toxicwaste cleanups should be paid for  what should be the mix of state money general business taxes and specific penalties on polluters Extending the time limit on filing lawsuits for toxic damage claims also will come up And weve got to address solid waste disposal said Mr Fink We havent figured out what to do with our garbage Social Issues Vincent J Graber a DemocratConservative from Buffalo will try again to pass a capitalpunishment bill Were going to go with the same bill weve been going with he said Regularly this passes both houses Regularly the Governor vetoes it The votes to override a veto are not there but Mr Graber said he thought he had gained a few A panel studying abortion the treatment of handicapped infants lifesustaining technology and other such issues is to report to Mr Cuomo by May 1 The Governor said he would not press again for a State Equal Rights Amendment unless Senate Republicans who oppose it show a change of heart Other Proposals Various people with power have pet projects Mr Fink for instance wants the state to help pay for prescription drugs for the poor Mr Rappleyea has a plan to create a panel of experts to help fashion agreement on revenue projections so that budget arguments can be over priorities not forecasts Herman D Farrell a Manhattan Democrat and head of the Assembly Banking Committee wants banks to guarantee access to checking accounts for the poor The head of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus Senator Leon Bogues a Manhattan Democrat said the caucus would urge a formidable program to provide housing for the poor and a firm plan to enforce minority subcontracting requirements in state contracts Senator Emanuel Gold a Queens Democrat wants to abolish the system by which a panel of citizens picks a list of potential judges for the states highest court the Court of Appeals The Governor can make appointments only from the committees list Mr Gold wants the Governor to make nominations and the panel to decide if the nominees are qualified similar to the judicial appointment system in New York City And then there is Gary Prouds cat Chong Chong has been missing for several years and to spare other catlovers the anguish he has suffered he is sponsoring a bill to require motorists who run over a cat to stop and report its death Mr Proud a Democratic Assemblyman from Rochester noted that motorists have been required since 1929 to stop if they run over a dog a horse or

CONGRESS;   DEMOCRATIC FEARS AND FRAZZLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/07/us/congress-democratic-fears-and-frazzles.html,Since the November election Democrats on Capitol Hill have been thrashing around in a state of fear and frustration Yes they kept control of the House of Representatives and they did win back two seats in the Republicandominated Senate But the crushing defeat of Walter F Mondale the man who best exemplified the Democratic tradition of the last 50 years a candidate widely supported by the partys Congressional delegation has brought on a period of soul searching When your Presidential candidate wins only his home state many Democrats have concluded you must be doing something wrong And as a result in the two months since the election a tremor of restlessness has been rumbling through Democratic ranks Most affected are the members in their 30s and 40s those with most of their career still ahead of them Like the Republicans who were condemned to minority status by the New Deal and its aftermath todays younger Democrats wonder whether they now face a future dominated by the opposition party The Armed Services Upheaval This sense of foreboding has set off a number of upheavals in recent weeks The latest came Friday when House Democrats ignored the appeals of their leader Thomas P ONeill Jr now beginning his last term as Speaker and deposed 80 yearold Melvin Price of Illinois as chairman of the Armed Services Committee They replaced him with Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin who is 34 years younger than Mr Price and is the first member of the VietnamWatergate generation in Congress to head a major House committee with a permanent membership Even before the election some members of this same generation were holding private meetings and discussing ways to assume more influence over Congressional and party decisions A group of Congressmen led by Richard A Gephardt of Missouri and Tony Coelho of California said they realized they had no chance of challenging the Speaker directly But they met with Mr ONeill and pressed him into creating an advisory council that would give younger lawmakers a greater voice in leadership deliberations Mr Gephardt who was first elected in 1974 became chairman of the Democratic caucus in the new Congress the fourthranking leadership post And he joined the fruitless effort of some younger Democratic governors led by Charles S Robb of Virginia to find a new chairman of the Democratic National Committee who would reflect the views of their generation Ripples of Resentment The Senate too felt these ripples of resentment Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida who came to Congress in 1970 the same year as Mr Aspin challenged Robert C Byrd of West Virginia for the Democratic leadership And while Mr Chiles lost badly his campaign reflected the widespread belief among Democratic lawmakers that neither Mr Byrd nor Mr ONeill embodies the image or the message that will restore the Democrats to domination in Washington any time soon For a start these younger Democrats realize that geography and demographics are working against them The shift of population out of the Frost Belt the heart of Democratic strength to the Sun Belt the new stronghold of the Republicans means that any future Democratic candidate for President will have an increasingly difficult time putting together a majority in the electoral college In the states of the old Confederacy Republicans retained 10 of the 22 Senate seats In House races Republicans shook up Democratic strategists by winning four new seats in Texas and three in North Carolina  just the sort of states that stand to gain more seats after the next reapportionment The Appeal to Younger Voters But the real shock to the Democrats was the Republican appeal to younger voters around the country Political analysts have long agreed that when voters of the baby boom generation now between the ages of about 25 and 40 finally settled down and defined their voting behavior they would dominate the political scene Their preference for the Republicans last fall does not guarantee how they will vote in the future but Democrats agree that at best the 1984 results are a warning that cannot be ignored So what do they do Part of the problem is one of style Mr ONeill and Mr Byrd grew up in an age when political success rested largely on local organization and personal contact One made his mark shaking hands in the Irish neighborhoods of Cambridge Mass the other playing his fiddle in the mountain hollows of West Virginia In the eyes of their younger colleagues both men are uncomfortable and ineffective on television the basis of most modern political campaigning It is striking that Mr Aspin and Mr Chiles made the same pitch The party needs spokesmen who can use television and counteract such Republican media stars as President Reagan and Bob Dole the new Senate majority leader More Challenges Ahead Therefore the next few years could bring more challenges to senior Democrats Senator Byrd might well be vulnerable to a betterplanned rebellion after the next election And once Mr ONeill retires his anointed successors in the House Jim Wright the majority leader and Thomas S Foley the party whip could face a fight as they try to move up the leadership ladder The more serious question is this Once the Democrats choose new spokesmen and they get on television what are they going to say So far the answers have been fragmentary at best Most Democrats agree that in recent years the Republicans have captured two simple but powerful ideas economic opportunity and national pride As a result many of the Democratic themes these days have a yes but    quality about them Yes we are for economic growth but we also care about the poor Yes we are for military strength but we also want to contain the Pentagon budget Accordingly House Democrats are hoping that the new chairman of the Budget Committee William H Gray 3d will be able to help synthesize some of these concepts As a black from Philadelphia he has credibility with the partys left wing but he has also made it clear that he will make tough choices on social programs and counteract the Democrats image as big spenders Asked how he can manage it Mr Gray is fond of noting that it was Richard M Nixon a conservative Republican who was able to open American relations with China Encouraged by Hart Looking back at the campaign some Democrats say they are encouraged by the success of Senator Gary Harts new ideas campaign which they envision as a model for future efforts They also see some promise in certain issues that appeal to younger and more affluent voters including environmental protection toxic waste disposal technological research support for education and the freedom to make personal decisions on subjects like abortion Perhaps the most powerful of all these potential issues is arms control and that is one reason the revolt by Mr Aspin an expert in the field was able to succeed As the events of last week demonstrate younger Democrats are searching for new leaders who can appeal to a new generation of voters But they are still unsure who many of those leaders should be and what they should say
CUOMO AT MIDTERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/07/nyregion/cuomo-at-midterm.html,NewsAnalysis ALBANY Jan 6  In his first two years as Governor Mario M Cuomo has made his mark on New York State and on the nation as much for what he has said as for what he has done That is the overall appraisal of legislators lobbyists other politicians and academics as New Yorks 52d Governor passes the midpoint of his term They say he has not been particularly successful in winning specific legislation or in executing specific programs Constituent groups particularly in the areas of environment housing and mental health say he has not done enough to carry through programs or resolve serious problems If you assess a governor by giving a scorecard on how many new things they have done this governor does not do well said Alan Chartock a professor of political science at the State University of New York at Albany who is host of a weekly radio show in Albany with Mr Cuomo But Professor Chartock and many others say that measure alone does not begin to capture the success of Mr Cuomo who three years ago was written off as a political loser and who now is talked about as a potential candidate for President Mario Cuomos chief achievement has been the alteration through his approach to communication of the terms of political discourse in New York said Prof Gerald Benjamin professor of political science at the State University College at New Paltz Indeed Mr Cuomo and his advisers suggest that his success as a public speaker  exemplified by his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention  is part of a developing political problem for him On balance he believes hes been a very successful Governor said Meyer S Frucher the president of the Battery Park City Authority and one of his top advisers but Mr Cuomo is petrified that he is measured against an unfair standard which is his own rhetoric He Does Whats Doable He speaks in absolutes Mr Frucher continued He speaks in good and bad But as an administrator he does whats doable The Governor and his advisers say they are pleased with what they have accomplished Mr Cuomo has positioned himself well by raising taxes and cutting personnel in his first year giving him a better budget base for cutting taxes and enacting specific programs as he approaches his reelection year There has been no major scandal Mr Cuomos staff has prepared a 55 page midterm report that lists the accomplishments of the administration These include timely completion of budgets passage of a bond issue for rebuilding the transportation network and the expansion of prison capacity Mr Cuomo however shrugged off the report as a list of things that occurred Asked for his own description of his accomplishments he responded with a theme rather than a list The notion of family he said The notion of synergism The notion of cooperation  which is what I mean by family  that notion has worked well for two years This state is working well together That say Professor Benjamin and others is an illustration of Mr Cuomos secret to success  his ability to take the complex abstruse conflicting confusing and sometimes just routine actions of a sprawling state government and reduce them to images that will grab the attention of the rank andfile citizen He has worked prodigously to reach those citizens through appearances on television and radio shows in speeches and trips around the state that resemble nothing so much as campaign swings Set Apart by Speeches Three of the defining events of Mr Cuomos first two years to use Professor Benjamins phrase were speeches his inaugural the Convention address and a lecture at the University of Notre Dame on why a Catholic politician could in good conscience support laws that permit abortion Mr Cuomos admirers say his ability to set a tone and to bind issues into compelling themes sets him apart from other politicians But many who work closely with his government  including admirers  say his soaring words do not always seem connected to what is happenening in the government They say that he talks of helping the homeless but that virtually none of the money appropriated for shelter has been spent They say that he talks of improving treatment of the mentally ill but that the mental health system remains tangled in dispute and delay He talks of preserving the environment but failed to offer a proposal to clean up toxic waste last session until too late for the Legislature to act Mr Cuomo often argues with the specifics of such criticism But he and his staff are looking toward his third legislative session which opens Wednesday as a time for him to propose and carry out substantive policy initiatives Spending Increases and Tax Cuts Indeed Mr Cuomos third year may well be his most challenging While he was criticized in his first two years for failing to set priorities this year he will have to balance pressure for potentially costly initiatives  such as welfare benefit increases and improvements in mental health care  with his own desire for a tax cut and mounting calls to reduce the States multibillion dollar deficit I want to be known Mr Cuomo said as the Governor who did them all simultaneously The Governors sensitivity to how he is perceived is widely known in Albany and it is used by those skillful in the ways of government Several lobbyists and legislators say they have discovered that the way to get the Governors attention is to attack him publicly Weve given him endless memos endless reports and we dont get anywhere said Judith Enck a lobbyist for environmental causes Its only when youre critical of him in the press that you get his attention In his first two years Mr Cuomo often spoke of his wish not to be misperceived or misinterpreted When he admitted error it was not error of policy but error of communication  either he did not explain things clearly he said or people did not listen carefully Senior Workers Retired In 1983 for example Mr Cuomos effort to reduce the work force disrupted many state agencies when many of their most senior and experienced workers accepted the early retirement that he offered after legislators objected to his plans for layoffs He says he was criticized afterward because he had not explained the program well not because of its effects To Mr Cuomo communication goes beyond words  it is selecting sometimes unconventional themes and using all the tools of his office to project images I believe in symbolism he said as he took office I want to convey a certain message in everything I do From his first day for example Mr Cuomo sought to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor Hugh L Carey who despite his initial successes in stabilizing city and state finances ended his eight years in office so low in public opinion polls that he was advised he could not win reelection A Message of Success Where Mr Carey put others in charge of daytoday details Mr Cuomo made a point of saying he would keep his hands on such details Where Mr Carey developed a reputation for being away from the office Mr Cuomo worked nights and weekends Where Mr Carey failed to come to terms with the Legislature on the budget Mr Cuomo reached agreement before the end of the fiscal year The message was simple under Mr Cuomo the system worked again But in a paper on Mr Cuomos first 18 months in office Professor Benjamin suggests that is not an agenda to fill a fouryear term Making the process work as it should is an achievement only in contrast to what has gone before he said Many legislators suggested that Mr Cuomo had found a simple way to make things work If everyone gets everything they want theres no problem with an early budget said Eric Lane counsel to Democrats in the Senate and author of a paper to be published in the Pace Law Review on Mr Cuomos budget dealings Specifics Go Unexamined From the point of view of the public Mr Cuomo has found that the details of an issues outcome were not always the most important thing so long as a few simple claims of success could be made Its an atmosphere in which people are not being particularly analytical said Lawrence S Huntington chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission a civic group made up mainly of banking and realestate executives The commission has complained that Mr Cuomos budgets have increased the States debt The Governor has achieved enormous popularity and following for his intellectual capabilities Mr Huntington said and that has caused people not to look at the specifics of his financial administration What is being closely watched in Albany now is how Mr Cuomos political strength prominence and possible ambitions will affect his government The Governor says he is drafting a credo for Democrats He has also urged Americans to look to New York for an example of how compassion and prudent government can be combined And some have begun to do that  Miss Enck for example said leaders of national environmental groups had been enthusiastic about Mr Cuomo because of his speeches I find it intriguing that his national image is so far from what hes really doing she said The national environmental leaders were just assuming Cuomo was the person they could count on But once they looked more closely at his record they got quickly disappointed Mr Cuomo freguently makes comparisons between running a state government and a national government He describes the State Correction Department as his defense department and he points out that the state must balance its budget while the Federal government does not At the same time he has sought to quiet talk about the Presidency but not by ruling it out He stresses for example that he is not traveling much outside the state so that he can concentrate on his work as governor Yet notes Richard Wade an historian at the City University of New York any Governor of New York has considerable access to national exposure Roosevelt didnt leave the state very much at all he said
DISMISSAL FROM ORDER HAS HUMAN COSTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/opinion/l-dismissal-from-order-has-human-costs-199603.html,To the Editor A news story about the latest move by the Sacred Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes to discipline members of religious orders in the United States Threat by Vatican Reported by Nuns Dec 15 outlined what the consequences of a dismissal might mean to those members In part it was accurate A dismissal could mean loss of employment and the actions foster resentment at what seems to many as interference in the internal affairs of our congregations However this does not capture the real emotional impact of a forced dismissal such as that which is threatened Members of religious orders are bound to one another and to their traditions by far more than juridical bonds just as families are No doubt among the 24 people in question there is a rich variety in their relationships with their orders and with the people in them But you may be sure that the pain of separation if it comes to that will be a deeply human one springing from the severing of delicate intricate and far reaching bonds of love affection shared suffering and shared ideals This is not to mention the pain of disillusionment nor the pain of their sisters who will lose them in this violent way MARYJANE FERRIER Newton Mass Dec 21 1984 The writer a member of the Society of the Sacred Heart is a family therapist
BOOKS OF THE TIMES;,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/10/books/books-of-the-times-204833.html,SOLSTICE By Joyce Carol Oates 243 pages E P Dutton 1595 IN Solstice her 16th novel the abundant Joyce Carol Oates returns to the contemporary scene after her recent detours into 19thcentury literary forms Bellefleur A Bloodsmoor Romance and Mysteries of Winterthurn and her overwrought attempt to pour the old wine of Aeschylus Oresteian trilogy into a new bottle of Washington politics Angel of Light But if the new novels rural Pennsylvania setting seems tranquil and if its story of a friendship between two women seems uncomplicated one should not be fooled The tertiary meaning of the word solstice is a furthest or culminating point a turning point and it is to all manner of extremes that Miss Oates has taken us in this tale of obsession and sickness nearly unto death And should one think that Miss Oates has abandoned all experimentation in what on the surface seems a conventional tale then let it be proposed that in Solstice she has stood Hemingway on his head and written a story that could just as well have been called Women Without Men Her title also refers to a sculpture  a figure of sorts in stone aluminum and bronze  created by a local but famous artist Morton Flaxman But Flaxman has long since died and left behind his wife Sheila Trask a painter who traffics in the less substantial stuff of light and labyrinths At the time of the novel she is working on a series called Ariadnes Thread It is to Sheila that Monica Jensen recently divorced is powerfully drawn In the dead of winter in a sunless labyrinth the two generate their own considerable heat Sheila Trask the painter is dark eccentric willful and unpredictable even  almost  beautiful Monica Jensen reflects upon first sighting her with derisive black eyes and heavy unplucked black brows and a wide unsmiling quizzical mouth Monica recently hired to teach at a local prep school for boys is golden and pretty a former prom queen loyal hardworking and popular She feels weak and uninteresting especially compared with Sheila Trask She feels wounded by the recent failure of her nineyear marriage which could not survive an abortion that her husband forced on her It has left her with a scar on her jaw  accidentally inflicted during an argument  which somewhat too obviously becomes a symbol of her wounded femininity Monica is deeply flattered by her developing friendship with Sheila Trask which comes to its first climax in a scene in which Sheila reaches out and touches the scar  one tentative forefinger direct not especially gentle Monica seems to be losing herself in the labyrinth of Sheilas world But is she really Though Sheila is an overwhelming presence Monica through her very insubstantiality seems to pervade the novel Miss Oates hardly describes her and rarely quotes her directly at least in the first half of Solstice But since the story is told from Monicas point of view her presence grows as strong as Sheilas The two in fact seem headed for a collision and this with the help of the authors erotic violent imagery lends the narrative its fateful imperative Solstice is a strong performance up to a point particularly admirable for the degree of drama it wrenches from its tranquil bucolic setting But its resolution is most unsatisfying and one is left to wonder if Miss Oates has not lost herself in her own artistic labyrinth Maybe Solstice is meant to be nothing more than a tour de force  an account of a lesbian relationship without explicitness evoking its erotic power solely through its imagery Or perhaps Miss Oates is suggesting that masculinefeminine bipolarity has little to do with the mix of gender After all Sheila Trask is a bully with as much selfcenteredness as the most extreme male chauvinist She is even implicated in what amounts to a rape of Monica though which of them is ultimately responsible is hard to decide On the other hand Monica becomes a vital organizing force in Sheilas life though whether her influence is uxorial or husbandly is also hard to say What is clear is that the ending of Solstice is unsatisfying It seems to trail off to disappear into itself I felt shut out as if a door had been slammed in my face I wanted to pound on it and cry What happens to Monicas teaching job What about her health Is she going to recover But maybe my dissatisfaction is exactly what Miss Oates is aiming for Early in their friendship Sheila Trask admits to Monica that she envies the form of the novel As the narrative paraphrases Sheilas thoughts The printed line after all is so orderly and chaste so chronologically determined  that is the reader is obliged to read line by line page by page in sequence very unlike the visual image which assaults the eye out of nowhere in a manner of speaking with no preparation and no power over the viewer to demand from him more than a moments casual contemplation Perhaps the sudden ending of Miss Oatess provocative story is a reflection of Sheila Trasks victory in this inverted battle of the sexes After all Sheila detested the very notion of a conceptualist art  words were an admission of failure The door is only closed to those of us unwilling to feel the shape of the story To which suggestion of failure I can only plead guilty At the end of Solstice I still longed for conceptualization and as long as novels are written in words I will probably continue to do so
BROADWAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/arts/broadway.html,AN anniversary an inauguration Synge and a Burton  not a bad way for a theatrical company to begin a new year In this case its the

U.S. SENDS WARNING OF POTENTIAL THREAT TO ABORTION CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/us/us-sends-warning-of-potential-threat-to-abortion-clinics.html,The Federal Government has issued a warning that is going to abortion clinics and medical offices around the country of a potential for violence Jan 2022 Jan 20 is the date of the start of President Reagans second term Jan 22 is the 12th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion The Government would not say if it had knowledge of specific threats linked to those dates The warning was delivered on Dec 28 by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to the Washington office of the National Abortion Federation By Federal count there have been 30 instances of bombing firebombing and arson at abortion clinics since May 1982 Some leaders of the abortion rights movement count as many as 60 violent attacks dating from 1977 The bureau cited another complication A number of abortion clinics around the nation that would usually be empty at night will be occupied by members of the National Organization for Women from Friday night Jan 18 through Sunday night Jan 20 The NOW members have been planning a vigil independently of the Federal warning to protest violence against abortion clinics The Federal authorities are now working closely with officials of the movement in the investigation but this is the most specific warning they have issued according to Barbara Radford executive director of the federation This is by far the most serious that we have received she said The message to me was that they were taking this very seriously The bureau says it now has 500 agents assigned to investigate anti abortion violence Although we have absolutely no intelligent information concerning planned violent antiabortion activities on Jan 22 the bureaus notice said we believe that the symbolism of this date represents a potential for increased action directed toward abortion clinics and or prochoice offices The warning noted that Jan 20 is the official date of the Presidents inauguration although it pointed out that the public ceremonies would be held Jan 21 because Jan 20 is a Sunday And Jan 22 according to the notice in addition to being the date of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade also marks the death date of the Christian martyr St Anastasious A person using the name Anastasious II has mailed a letter threatening violence to a prochoice advocate in 1984 the notice said The vigil by the NOW members has been planned at 20 to 30 clinics in the hope of discouraging attacks To this point it is clear that the people who have been attacking the clinics have gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid attacking clinics with anybody in them said Judy Goldsmith president of NOW At some point people who believe something Miss Goldsmith said have to stand up against people who are nothing less than bullies who are saying that they are above the law that they do not have to abide by the law of the land and that they will get their way It Has Forwarded Notice The National Abortion Federation which serves as the Washington representatve and clearing house for organizations clinics and referral offices nationwide has forwarded the bureaus notice to 300 members and to the Planned Parenthood organization which has several hundred offices of its own The federation which for months has been urging its members to install floodlights electronic security systems and window screens and to leave the buildings at night is distressed by the vigil plan The thought that you would risk someones life to get some publicity out of this issue is absolutely irresponsible Miss Radford said Because no one has blown up a building with people in it yet Im not willing to believe that the next time theyre not going to The 30 attacks listed by the Federal authorities have occurred in Florida Georgia Delaware Maryland Virginia Texas California Washington and the District of Columbia They have caused no injuries or deaths Arrests and some convictions have been obtained in seven of the 24 cases in 1984 The Federal Bureau of Investigation while assisting the bureau of alcohol and tobacco has not entered full force into the investigation because it says it has no evidence of a conspiracy extending across state lines No responsibility for any attack has been claimed by Anastasious II but the threat mentioned in the bureaus warning might have been the one made against Bill Baird founder of the Parents Aid Society Baird Reports a Letter Mr Baird whose Hempstead LI clinic was doused with gasoline and set ablaze in 1979 by a man who walked in while the building was filled with staff and patients said that he had received a letter on Oct 10 1984 the same day that a threat was reported against Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun author of the Roe v Wade decision I am afraid the whole abortion movement is going to go up in flames Mr Baird said He then read the threatening letter aloud by telephone from Long Island Oh yes Mr Baird he read just as you have done it to the least of all so shall it be done to you Anastasius is apparently a reference to a martyr called St Anastasius the Persian a Persian soldier who converted to Christiantity became a monk and later was executed by orderthe Persian king on Jan 22 628 AD

NUNS' SUPERIORS ASK MODERATION BY THE VATICAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/us/nuns-superiors-ask-moderation-by-the-vatican.html,The heads of the orders of 24 nuns whom the Vatican has threatened with expulsion because of their views on abortion issued a joint statement of concern yesterday for the nuns that stopped short of taking any side The statement issued after a two day meeting called for an inherently just process to resolve the conflict that would honor the conscience of all involved The unsigned statement was issued by the Leadership Conference of Women Religious an umbrella organization made up of the heads of Roman Catholic orders for women A conference representative said no list of participants would be supplied Men Recant on Stand In a related development three of the four men who are also under disciplinary warning for lending their names to an advertisment saying there was latitude among Catholic believers on abortion have publicly recanted their position A spokesman for the United States Catholic Conference said he was not certain whether the response by the two priests and a religious brother satisfied the Vaticans demand The threeparagraph statement by the nuns superiors avoided either direct support for the nuns or for the Vaticans assertion that their actions constituted proper grounds for dismissal It evenhandedly appealed for respect for the religious who signed the statement and affirmed the teaching office of the church The statement was seen by some church officials as a carefully worded attempt to keep negotiating channels open with the Vatican at a time when a growing crisis has developed over its handling of the matter It was also read by those officials as a discreet reminder that rights of due process for settling disputes are found in canon law and should be scrupulously honored A source close to the superiors said they had agreed to refrain from public comment on the statement Attempts to reach the superiors by telephone were unsuccessful Met in Maryland The superiors issued the statement after meeting in Silver Spring Md Also present were the superiors of the men and Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco who has been appointed by the Vatican to conduct a study of religious orders At issue is the nuns support of the paid advertisement that questioned the Vaticans stand that only one rightful view on abortion exists within the church The advertisement ran Oct 7 in The New York Times They were among 97 original signers of the statement sponsored by Catholics For A Free Choice a group that favors legal abortion The statement said in part that a diversity of opinions on abortion were held by Catholics apart from the church hierarchys stand that abortion is always immoral On Dec 18 the Vaticans Congregation for Religious and Secular Insitutes said the nuns had been instructed to retract their position or face possible dismissal from their orders The instructions dated Nov 30 and sent to the superiors of the signers called their action a flagrant scandal Protest Against Threat Many of the nuns in a joint statement reacted with surprise and anguish to the Vaticans action None have indicated a willingness to recant Many have said they believed the Vaticans move imperiled freedom of speech within the church and protested the threatened expulsion as unduly harsh Church officials have argued that they are actually maintaining that more than one legitimate moral position on abortion can be found in Catholicism A central element in the dispute is the Vaticans strategy toward women in the church in a climate of growing concern over feminist issues Many nuns said they were offended by the Vaticans direct attack on them without consulting them their superiors or the American bishops In separate responses three of the male clerics who signed the abortion statement have made public retractions The Rev Jerry Kaelin of Cincinnati a Franciscan priest said in a statement that he affirmed the church teaching on the evil of abortion which so many are driven to in desperation He added I retract any contradiction of church teaching implied Similar statements were made by Brother Raymond McManaman a Christian Brother on the faculty of Lewis University in Lockport Ill and the Rev Joseph Connolly of Severn Md a Baltimore priest WASHINGTON Jan 10 UPI  Following is the text of a statement issued by the leaders of the religious orders of those nuns who signed the abortion statement Major superiors of those religious whose names appeared in the Oct 7 New York Times ad met in Silver Spring Md on Jan 6 and 7 Also present were representatives of the Conference of Major Superiors of Men and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious In general the discussion centered on the responsibility of congregational leadership for the wellbeing of their communities respecting the religious who signed the statement and upholding the teaching office of the church Participants recognize that a satisfactory resolution of the situation necessitates measures that are inherently just and that honor the conscience of all involved and the complexity of the doctrinal and pastoral issues
CUOMO'S PLANS STRIKE BALANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/nyregion/cuomo-s-plans-strike-balance.html,News Analysis ALBANY Jan 10  Governor Cuomos words to the new Legislature Wednesday resounded with the rich history of New York government Look around this room he told the crowd in the cavernous Assembly chamber during his State of the State speech the festive opening of the official Albany season The future once happened here The Governor has a highly developed sense of history and for this years gathering he invoked memories of great political careers and legislative ideas that had been born here But if his words harked back to Alfred E Smith Franklin D Roosevelt and their Democratic programs for New York which grew into the national social legislation of the New Deal his fiscal proposals could have come from the most conservative of Republicans In a sense the words could have come from Mr Roosevelt himself who entered national office extolling budget balance But Mr Cuomos State of the State rhetorical focus was on the New Deal legislation that followed which he called the legislative agenda that eventually changed America and through America helped change the world Focus on Government Finance Those rhetorical flourishes at the end of his speech contrasted with his programmatic focus Twothirds of Mr Cuomos speech and great sections of the detailed 82page booklet that accompanied it focused on government finance And when the Governor made his first workaday followup today an indication of what he believed to be the most important thing to concentrate on it was with the Republican State Comptroller and the head of the state Business Council at his side and comprehensive financial reform as their topic The mixture of New Deal oratory and conservative concentration on fiscal sobriety reflects a handful of basic decisions according to people who work for the Governor First no matter what political ambitions might have been stirred in Mr Cuomo by the talk that he could be the Democratic nominee for President in 1988 he has decided that the best way to get wherever he might be going is to concentrate on deeds not words  on running the state well Liberal and Conservative Second the Governor and his top staff argue that what might sound like a liberalconservative conflict actually reflects an effort for balance Mr Cuomos top aide Michael J Del Giudice in assessing the package of proposals that the Governor made to the Legislature said Traditional liberals spend Traditional conservatives cut Heres some of both Third the Governor has become convinced that this will be the year in Albany for fiscal issues Fiscal minutiae can fascinate politicians who must deal with the intricacies of government and the fuel that runs it money Can you believe a crowd that breaks into applause when they heard the phrase Cap the spring borrowing  Mr Del Giudice said in a recollection of some of the reaction to Mr Cuomos speech But Comptroller Edward V Regan noted that debt reduction held little political appeal for the public And at their joint news conference today the Governor agreed The political temptation is to spend now  he said There are some political pluses however in the Governors plan Not all of the financial package is dreary At the base of it is a big tax cut  about 12 billion over three years When Mr Cuomos press secretary Martin Steadman looked out at yesterdays audience he saw Republican legislators applauding for some proposals Democrats for others Then the Governor said tax cut and  boom  everybody was up Mr Cuomo tells friends that the national attention that focused on him after his two big speeches  the keynote address at the Democratic national convention and the one at Notre Dame in which he argued that officials who are Catholic need not act officially against abortion  will fade By midyear he says United States Senators will be touring the nation running for President and he will be toiling in happy obscurity in Albany He suggested at one time that the Democratic party after President Reagans overwhelming reelection might need a formal credo to tell voters where it stands and he volunteered to write it But lately he has said the real Democratic credo will be read through the actions of Democratic governors the partys performers in executive office And he has decided that tidying up the financial books of a New York government that has been juggling them for a quarter of a century  cleaning up the states act said Mr Del Giudice  is the place for him to start Perfected by Republicans Incongruously a Governor who talks like a Democratic liberal while often acting like a Republican conservative will be trying to reverse a policy of budgetary finagling that was perfected by New York Republicans Equally incongruous is the smiling presence at his side of Mr Regan the top elected Republican in state office It was a change in the states fiscal year by Gov Thomas E Dewey the Comptroller said today that opened up the magic window that encouraged the state to pay this years bills with next years money The state fiscal year ends March 31 while school district fiscal years end June 30 So the state got in the habit of borrowing at the start of its fiscal year to pay aid to schools at the end of their fiscal years The result was the spring borrowing that ballooned under another Republican Nelson A Rockefeller and presently exceeds 4 billion Now comes Mr Cuomo invoking the New Deal spirit while he campaigns for an honestly balanced budget He left it to Mr Regan today to make the political point for him Growing deficits have a way of mugging social programs the Comptroller said at their news conference All we have to do is look at Washington

youngsters who have dropped out of school  should editorially favor bilingual education Ann Pajor 17 editor of the newspapers Quick Connections column and a senior at Forest Hills High School and Serap Bozkent 17 a student at James Madison High School and a senior editor were opposed Were of foreign background said Miss Pajor whose parents are from Hungary Seraps from Turkey They had to learn English Everybody should Why should America become bilingual But said Miss Lennon Spanishspeaking people make up 15 25 percent of the population We shouldnt force them to speak English by presenting it as a superior language Were not saying its superior said Miss Bozkent They should just adjust to us The discussion was joined by other writers and editors of the paper until Donna Lawson the program director who functions as a top editor turned the discussion to other political and social issues The paper has a budget of 180000 a year and is financed by the New York City Youth Board and a bevy of city corporations Its seeks to train teen agers to be journalists and writers and to report information of interest to teenagers in the city We like to say that 150 inform 250000 said Keith Hefner executive director of Youth CommunicationNew York Center Inc which is the parent of New Youth Connections He added that the paper is meant to persuade as well  to be an advocate for the kids in the city Mr Hefner a former publisher became involved in the Dome Project an Upper West Side program of writing workshops for teenagers in 1980 He and three young writers from the project went to Chicago to study a similar paper and decided that one could be started here Three pilot issues were put out in May June and July of 1980 We published 10000 copies he said and soon we had orders totaling 44000 Began in New York in 81 The first regular edition of New Youth Connections was published in January 1981 and has come out monthly ever since It is written laid out and typeset in the newspapers offices and printed by a contractor It prints 80000 copies a month and claims a readership of 273000 It is sold to schools in lots ranging from 50 to 500 copies the yearly cost of the lots

which students work at the paper for a semester instead of going to classes from the City as School in which students work one full day a week at the paper and from alternative programs in the schools In addition they publish a newsletter in the Spofford Juvenile Center a detention center in the South Bronx for youngsters awaiting trial Most of the staff members are young men and women who have decided upon writing as a career Courtney Goodloe 16 of the City as School wrote the papers editorial against basing the battleship Iowa which has a nuclear capability on Staten Island I enjoy writing she said I like reviews politics The paper is making me a writer Andy Faison 20 the papers movie reviewer used to find compositions difficult at Theodore Roosevelt High School but he expects soon to go to college at Northwestern University Hamilton College or Adelphi University My he said with a grin how Ive grown Janice Jenkins 19 a sophomore at Fordham University entered one of the papers writing contests won it entered another won it and decided she wanted to be a writer Its important to me she said I have a lot to say and not enough chances to say it The Papers Varied Subjects That same feeling can be sensed around the New Youth Connections editorial table where any subject of interest to New Yorks urban teen agers provides material for articles They are as varied as teenage pregnancy and abortion teenagers as business successes drugs and violence and food and health At the conference Serap Bozkent said she was working on a feature linking certain music groups to satanic cults Michele Trester 17 of Hunter College High School said she would make demographic charts on teenagers attitudes and problems Maria Cooper 16 of Springfield Gardens High School reported on her adoption piece about teenagers aged 11 to 16 with babies and the choices they dont know they have Karl Wagoner 17 of Art and Design High School the cartoonist said he was trying to dream up a cartoon

magazines and newspapers who advise them At the conference Felecia Ligon 19 a graduate of Hunter College High School told how her mentor helped me get into Syracuse The newspapers writers have gone on to such schools as Swarthmore and Harvard Colleges It manages according to Mr Hefner to instill such a sense of purpose that the managing editor Rachel Swarns is now deciding whether to go on to Wesleyan or Howard University and Janice Jenkins has just about made up her mind to be the first black Congresswoman from the South Bronx
CORRECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/12/nyregion/c-correction-211093.html,Because of editing errors a dispatch yesterday about a warning to the National Abortion Federation erroneously attributed two statements The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms which issued the warning did not point out that public inaugural ceremonies for President Reagan would be held Jan 21 and did not say the National Organization for Women would conduct vigils at abortion clinics around the nation from Friday night Jan 18 through Sunday night Jan 20

ABORTION CLINIC OWNER WARNS OF ARMED DEFENSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/12/us/abortion-clinic-owner-warns-of-armed-defense.html,A leading advocate of abortion rights said today that abortion clinics had posted armed guards and stocked guns as part of a plan to prevent the bombing of their facilities The advocate Bill Baird who owns an abortion clinic here and two on Long Island also said that a coalition of abortion rights advocates and clinic owners from around the country had hired a private detective agency to investigate antiabortion violence Mr Baird said he did not know how many organizations were participating in the coalition We are in a state of siege a state of war Mr Baird said People are scared to death Many clinics are folding many doctors quitting We are asking our supporters to hold on Seeking Evidence of Conspiracy Mr Baird said the coalition the Pro Choice Defense League would seek to determine whether there was a common denominator to this terrorism He said the league established last week would also teach clinic operators how to defend themselves and their facilities Mr Baird declined to name clinics that had posted armed guards saying that to name such facilities would set them up as targets But the owner of two abortion clinics in northern Florida who spoke on the condition that she would not be identified said she had stocked her facilities with numerous but unspecified types of weapons Its fairly common she said adding that she now packs a pistol No Knowledge of Arms Measures But Barbara A Radford executive director of the National Abortion Federation which represents 284 abortion service groups across the country said I dont know of any of my membership that are arming themselves She said she was aware of one physician in Florida who began carrying a gun after a particularly violent attack on his clinic but has since stopped Speaking of Mr Baird she added Bill is angry He was an early victim of horrible violence He believes in confrontational politics but hes not speaking for the providers in this country I guess hes trying to get attention for this problem but personally I abhor his tactics Mr Baird discussed the coalition at a news conference a day after it was disclosed that the Federal Government had warned operators of abortion clinics and medical offices of a potential for violence Jan 2022 Anniversary of Court Decision Some abortion rights advocates believe the chance of violence will be especially high then because it marks the beginning of President Reagans second term and the 12th anniversary of the Supreme Courts decision legalizing abortion Nanette Falkenberg the director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said clinics always take extra security precautions on Jan 22 Its a very important day in terms of right tolife activity around the country she said Theres a history of picketing harassment and invasions She also said that most clinics had already increased security to the point where theres not much more they can do Nonetheless she added We have never had an official warning like this before and were taking it very seriously Theres enormous fear said Barbara Methvin the executive director of the Eastern Womens Center at 14 East 60th Street in Manhattan Theres suspicion of every unusual person or package that enters this building Were in the process of making it as safe as possible We dont want to talk about what these measures are Charges of Inside Information In issuing the warning the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms said it had no direct knowledge of any planned violence But Mr Baird said he thought the bureau had acted because it had inside information and wanted to exculpate itself in advance Mr Baird said he did not have any specific evidence to support his allegation that the bureau had inside information The Federal Government has said there have been 30 instances of bombing firebombing and arson at abortion clinics since May 1982 Leaders of the abortion rights movement however say there have been as many as 60 violent attacks in the last seven years At the news conference Mr Baird accused leaders of conservative groups and the Roman Catholic Church of inciting antiabortion violence with harsh personal attacks He asked them to mute their rhetoric so that passions may cool I call on them not to label us Hitlers devils and murderers he said Mr Baird once again charged that abortion foes had conspired to firebomb abortion clinics around the country Firebombing Six Years Ago Mr Baird whose clinic in Hempstead LI was firebombed six years ago while 50 people were in the building said delegates to the 1980 Right to Life convention conspired to bomb the clinics The group discussed plans to invade abortion facilities and to firebomb them he said in a signed affidavit released at the news conference I heard members say Gasohol is cheaper than gasoline to firebomb these mills  But Dan Donehey a spokesman for the antiabortion group denied Mr Bairds allegations He said the group had repeatedly denounced violence directed at abortion clinics and charged that Mr Baird was seeking selfaggrandizing publicity Bill Baird seems to make it his job to go round using the media to promote himself and his business interests said James Bopp general counsel of the Washingtonbased group Hes been making the same charges for years and theyre totally groundless This is just a smear Mr Baird said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was given the affidavits four years ago but refused to act A spokesmen for the FBI Manuel Marquez declined to comment on the specifics of the allegations But he emphasized that the bureau investigates all reasonable complaints
REAGAN'S NEXT TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/magazine/reagan-s-next-term.html,William Safire is a columnist for The New York Times THE 50TH AMERICAN Presidential Inaugural is the way it is being billed but a few historians may remember the event next week as the first inauguration of a President of the United States to be held on a Super Bowl Sunday Presidentelect James Monroe first to confront the issue of a swearingin on the Christian Sabbath followed the whatstherush advice of Chief Justice John Marshall they waited until Monday which left the nation without a President for one day A century and a half into our history with war imminent Woodrow Wilson broke the taboo and took the oath on Sunday In 1957 Dwight D Eisenhower also set aside the Monroe precedent he followed Wilson in choosing a Sunday ceremony but added a newsmanagement wrinkle by barring the press from the first oath taking and restaging it for the public the next day How has Ronald Wilson Reagan handled his Sundayinaugural problem which is compounded this time by competition with the nations most riveting sports event He has chosen Eisenhowers course and will take the oath on Sunday in a private ceremony followed by a media event 24 hours later But the press is no longer as meek as it was in Eisenhowers day and the Reagan White House does not want an unnecessary controversy roiling a call for unity Perhaps pool coverage will be permitted with some picturetaking of the handshakes afterward thus positioning Reagan between Wilson and Eisenhower but the publicity lid will be pressed down to avoid detracting from the ceremony the next day This solution sends several signals for the next Reagan term Concern will be shown for piety but religious observance is a distant second to the need to have a finger continuously on the button Religion reigns in rhetoric but national security rules the roost Tradition will be served but it will be the specific tradition found to justify Reagans course  hes all for Monroes doctrines but he likes Ike The press does not in the Presidents mind represent the public he was the one elected to do that and he is willing to let the media holler all they like  then hell bend just a tad enough to retain an image of amiability This President understands the personal priorities of most Americans  first to watch the game then to watch his speech  and he is determined to get the Government to follow the majoritys wishes Thus Reagan will stay in the pocket on Inaugural and Super Bowl Sunday and will then provide a live instant replay of his oathtaking the next day when the nation is ready to pay attention Those are a few symbolic clues to what to expect in the next four years Another is provided by a senior Administration official rarely does an anonymityseeker or a reporter want to use the designation junior official who says What youve seen is pretty much what youll see At 73 President Reagan  in his second Inaugural Address and his fourth State of the Union and Budget messages  is not about to seek a new direction that veers from his last terms New Direction He is likely to chart a second term that will be surprisingly unsurprising and ringingly Reaganesque  with a few mid course corrections The second Inaugural Day will have its theme of the day a communications device put in place to get across the Presidential message rather than respond to the news medias idea of the news The Presidents chosen theme aides murmur is likely to be We the People the first words of the Preamble to the Constitution which will celebrate its 200th anniversary during the coming term an event that Reagan will hardly let go unnoticed We the People  and for Reagans purposes capitalize that P  nicely evokes an unbeatable political trinity patriotic tradition national unity populism We the People  like Let Us Begin and Bring Us Together  is a rallying cry not a theme For the past four years the Reagan themes have been growth without inflation peace through strength a return to traditional values That is still the essence of Reaganism that is what he wants to be remembered for In coming weeks the President will spell out specific ideas to buttress and advance these themes and in so doing should define his Presidency especially his second term Following are the refinements of his continuing themes that his top aides say will inform his remaining time in office along with an indication of the internal battles he will permit to be fought in approaching his goals and some assessment of his chances of success GROWTH WITHOUT INFLATION  PLUS CUTTING THE DEFICIT A curlyourhair recession with high unemployment was needed to do it and a worldwide oil glut was a great help but nobody can gainsay Reagans success in stopping the doubledigit inflation of the 1970s In the last two years we have seen a comparatively mild 4 percentayear rise in the cost of living Too many of us forget what raging inflation was doing to the American economy and psyche a few years ago As the value of savings eroded thrift became a habit of fools as the cost of everything seemed relentlessly zooming upward the pressure was on to borrow and buy before it was too late If interest rates were 10 percent and inflation was 10 percent savers and lenders received nothing  so why not cross the street to join the race to borrow and spend The widespread expectation of more of the same inflation was a wind that whipped the fire with the Government feeling a sense of helplessness and most of the elderly experiencing a sense of dread at the loss of the value of pensions and savings Having gone through the fires of resentment during the worst recession in most memories in his first term Reaganomics is giving voodoo a bad name went the quip the President is hardly going to throw away that genuine inflation slowing achievement in his second term Therefore we can count on economic decisions made in the next four years based on holding down inflation That is the ultimate priority because stopping inflation  encouraging real rather than ephemeral growth  is something Mr Reagan wants to be remembered for It should follow after a time that this anti inflationary record and message will affect the expectations of borrowers and lenders reducing real interest rates If inflation stays at 4 percent and real interest rates have historically been about 3 percent then the prime rate should add up to about 7 percent  not the roughly 10 percent it is today Real rates have stayed abnormally high because many people understandably fear that the huge deficit will reignite inflation certainly that growing deficit was the great failure of the Reagan first term That points to the first item on the Reagan agenda for the second term Control spending to reduce the deficit His target is realistic to cut the deficit to 4 percent of the gross national product in fiscal 1986 3 percent in 1987 2 percent in 1988 Those percentages sound like less of a failure than the huge red ink dollar figures The deficit can be shrunk only by cutting spending or raising tax revenues or a combination of both obviously if Reagan cannot set the pattern for reduction in the growth of spending in the first year after his reelection landslide he will never do it That accounts for all the orchestrated agonizing about budget freezes and cuts lately and the return to muttering about terminating the Departments of Education and Energy Draconian is the word proudly used for proposed spending cuts after Draco the Greek lawgiver who recommended the death penalty for every infraction of the rules The President is surely aware that Washington lawgivers expect the deficit to be reduced only after he accepts two tradeoffs demanded by Congress 1 You will get many of your domestic budget cuts only if you substantially reduce the planned increases in your defense spending and 2 you will get an overall spending reduction only if you agree to raise taxes at the same time thereby attacking the deficit from both sides Sounds rational enough thats the way the system has worked before But the President intends to change the steps of that minuet arriving at a compromise in his own way First the defense buildup will continue to be aggressively defended We will discuss Reagans refinements on Peace Through Strength and its Star Wars development in a moment but we can expect him to make a fierce effort throughout his second term to resist the natural inclination of the Congress to wed defense and nondefense cuts EXT HE IS NOT FOOLing about refusing to tie spending reductions to tax increases Pols and pundits tend to overlook the human element Reagan was taken to the cleaners by House Speaker Thomas P Tip ONeill in his first term on what was supposed to be a deal matching three dollars of spending cuts to one dollar of tax increases  the spending cut fell far short The President tells his men he will not be doublecrossed that way again and will be ready to go to the country in the 1986 elections to defeat the taxraising Democrats As the 1984 campaign showed hes good at that Does that augur impasse and a fight to the finish No government does not work that way By refusing to make a direct deal between spending and taxing the President I suspect invites an indirect deal on another basis tax simplification At the Presidents direction Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan has come up with a radical revision of the tax code that scraps most exemptions and lowers all rates As a result corporations and taxsheltered individuals would pay more most other individuals less That proposal delighted supplysiders and infuriated just about every interest group and local politician in the country It is surely as stunning and revolutionary and costly to the upper middle class as Richard M Nixons welfare reform proposal which offered to subsidize the working poor but was defeated by disbelieving Democrats who now wistfully refer to that lost liberal opportunity as Nixons Good Deed The Treasury tax plan  Reagan will make all but the most criticized parts of it his own plan  is resoundingly populist We the People its advocacy is particularly suited to massmedia sale by a President who delights in putting himself on the little mans side The Administrations idea is to buy much of this tax simplification by quietly allowing it to be tied to a tax increase As it stands now in its pristine and politically impossible form the Regan proposal is revenue neutral in the backhanded language of bureaucracy but it can be made revenue enhancing with the greatest of ease by lowering rates slightly less with nobody noticing in the general discombobulation of accountants and sweeping revision of the tax codes In this comprehensive way Reagan hopes to get both his spending cuts and part of his tax simplification without eviscerating his defense plans The Democrats would in this elaborate minuet get their tax increase without being punished for it Reagan will treat that increase with a reaction as innocent as Jimmy Durantes when the comedian was discovered trying to steal the huge elephant Jumbo What elephant As deficits are reduced and inflation is held down the plan or hope is to trust to growth as the way to stability and modernization To unleash incentive regulatory reform will be talked about and a bipartisan task force appointed something may come of it More to the point is a push during the second term to get tough with the Japanese under the rubric of an initiative good word  whatever happened to the Caribbean Basin Initiative to stimulate American industrys competitiveness abroad To keep the Federal Reserve Board stimulationminded plans will be put forward to lessen its independence by making the term of the Chairman match the Presidents term appointing the Treasury Secretary to the board or putting the boards budget under White House control These are not likely to be taken seriously by the Congress as the Fed exists to be bashed by Presidents who like to pass the monetary buck Above all Reagan has demonstrated that he believes that the key to economic growth is to get Government out of the way of the remarkable engine of the free economy The conqueror of inflation wants to be remembered in his second term as the reformer as well as reducer of taxes and as the President who gained control of entitlements especially Medicare He might make it Much will depend on the length and depth of the next recession PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH  AND ARMS REDUCTION Two battle lines will be drawn in the War of the Defense Budget throughout the Reagan second term the Battle of How Much and the Battle of What Kind The easiertofollow Battle of How Much is more familiar to headline readers Stockman Demands Weinberger Cut 8 Billion Kicking and Screaming Weinberger Cuts 4 Billion Reagan Backs Defense Secretary Says Rock Bottom 9 Percent Rate of Growth Vital Congress Chops Defense Budget 16 Billion Now 50 Billion More in Coming Years and finally Defense Foes Routed Reagan Hails 8 Percent Increase with a simultaneous play in another paper Arms Buildup Curtailed Dems Say Savings to be 40 Billion Over Three Years The newspaper glancer and the television viewer come away with a vague impression that an arms buildup is being achieved while billions are being cut from the defense budget In fact during Jimmy Carters first three years defense budgets averaged out flat turning up only in his last year In the first two Reagan years defense budgets jumped an average of 10 percent a year in the second half of Reagans first term increases averaged less than 5 percent The current Pentagon posturing for the next three years averages over 8 percent but that will never happen the average is likely to stay around 5 percent enabling Reagan to say to history that he restored American strength in the 1980s true and his critics to say they restrained him from breaking the economy by indulging the Pentagons every goldplated whim also true President Reagan has two advantages in the Battle of How Much He can go to the people with his judgment on the nations security on which a President is generally trusted especially when he is not running again and he can say he needs new weapons systems as bargaining chips in his arms control talks with the Soviet Union IS OPPONENTS whose numbers and influence are likely to grow in the second term have several advantages in the Battle of What Kind First knowledgeable critics like Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin can rough up Pentagon requests in the subcommittee clinches sometimes defeating them in detail Second major opposition is likely to come from two Democratic Senators of national stature on the Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn of Georgia a hawk and defense expert who is willing to step into wise old NATObaiting Mike Mansfields shoes in challenging our troop commitment in Europe and Gary Hart of Colorado a wellversed military reformer who may choose to leave the Senate in 1987 to start his second run for President Finally the WhatKind questions are causing some agonizing reappraisals in the Pentagon itself How should we respond if Western Europes defense spending fails to keep pace or if Japan is unwilling to shoulder its burden in both defense and foreign aid How much should we depend on and send arms and trainers to surrogates like Honduras Pakistan South Korea and especially Turkey The secondterm Reagan is likely to fence a Talmudic metaphor used as a verb in Pentagonese meaning protect from budgetary onslaught several favored ideas Among these are The smartening of conventional weaponry  No more torpedoes that miss their targets no more World War II shells lobbed into Lebanon by the battleship New Jersey no more dumb bombs that do not home in A greater emphasis will be placed on precisionguided munitions such as cruise missiles endowed with much greater accuracy Stealth technology  the ability to sneak past radar detection An attempt will probably be made to snatch funds from Stealth to keep the production lines of the unstealthy B1 bomber going past its cutoff dates but that extension will be resisted by the advocates of change Mobility of forces  Not paper commands like a socalled rapid deployment force headquartered in Florida but troops trained and equipment fitted to cargo planes able to lift a force to wage and win small wars in hot spots other than Europe Special operations  Elite teams available for antiterrorist actions on an inandout sorry aboutthat basis the command closely coordinated with  and subject to the political and diplomatic guidance of  White House and State Department officers The Strategic Defense Initiative  derogated as Star Wars  the most controversial of the fenced programs The Presidents plan to build a global shield against incoming missiles flies in the face of a generation of armscontrol theory which has relied on MAD  mutual assured destruction  to deter an attack Scientists can be found to argue that the proposal is either technologically crackbrained or eminently feasible but the realities are these 1 A certain common sense underlies an idea to build a defense against an offense even if the defense is not perfect and not to rely on the rationality or good will of some unknown future superpower leader 2 This is Ronald Reagans personally cherished idea buttressed by science adviser George Keyworth When it was inserted by the President into a speech in 1983 it stunned most of the military and diplomatic establishment 3 In a sense the idea of missile defense has worked already More than anything else the possibility that we may be serious about building a global shield has drawn the Soviet Union back to the negotiating table in umbrella talks that include what we fear their landbased offensive missiles and what they fear our space plans The SDI  Reagan will have to give it a less bureaucratic name to overcome the builtin derision of Star Wars  is in the Presidents eyes neither a destabilizing idea nor a bargaining chip In a stroke it ends the inexorability of an offensive arms race which Reagan men believe the Soviet Union has been winning in the past decade and which the SALT agreements codified New defensive technology in space would make obsolete the gains in Soviet offensive power By threatening to leapfrog the Russians landbased offensive emphasis Reagan  to mix a metaphor  has reshuffled the deck and the Kremlin obviously knows it Moscows heirapparent Mikhail S Gorbachev in his recent visit to London persuaded Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to prevail on Reagan  before armscontrol talks even began  to forswear deployment of such a shield without negotiation with the Soviet Union But the President is unwilling at least now to agree to limit such deployment in return for Soviet missile reductions and had slapped down aides who were too eager to use his idea as a bargaining chip During the next term we can expect a concerted United States attempt to tie our space defense plans to the Soviet Unions defense plans rather than to an exclusive youcutoffense wewont builddefense swap Big question Is Reagan sincere in his stillvague offer to share with Moscow research into shield technology That was what Walter Mondale ridiculed in his second debate with the President but at least one advocate of hardheaded detente  Nixon  thinks the sharing concept has merit and the 37th President is in fairly frequent contact with the 40th on such strategic matters If Reagan is to be remembered as a peacemaker a judgment of history that all Presidents covet this muchchuckledat notion may be the key in future arms control talks President Reagans dedication to his central and original idea is likely to require frequent reaffirmation in the course of negotiation leading to a summit meeting sometime in his next term Secretary of State George P Shultz is in charge of this negotiation and he made a point of having Paul Nitze  whose unauthorized walk in the woods with his Soviet counterpart to put forward an armscontrol compromise infuriated hawks  appointed his adviser by the President Caspar W Cap Weinberger Secretary of Defense is the active kibitzer in this but the President made a point of bringing in Lieut Gen Edward Rowny the Russian speaking hardline veteran of SALT wars to listen to his views which often reflect Weinbergers and those of William J Casey Director of Central Intelligence before sending him with the team to Geneva Which Reagan will predominate in the second term  Shultzs pragmatic Reagan or Weinbergers ideological Reagan Beware of that question because it ignores the great paradox in the Reagan Administation The rivalry between Shultz and Weinberger dates back to Nixon days when Weinberger was Shultzs deputy at the new Office of Management and Budget I worked on speeches and messages with both men enjoying Shultzs steady as you go philosophy and Weinbergers skill in slipping a controversial self fulfilling prophecy past a bluepenciling bureaucracy to enliven the usually turgid budget message Even then the difference in style was apparent Shultz was the negotiator and synthesisseeker Weinberger the position taker delighting in his sobriquet Cap the Knife After the fall both went to the Bechtel Group Inc international builders where Shultz was the vice chairman Weinberger as legal counsel chafed at being kept out of board meetings by Shultz who preferred settlement and progress rather than litigated victory and no construction But Weinberger remained close to candidate Reagan and at Cabinet picking time did nothing to discourage the thesis that two men from Bechtel would be one too many The choice of Weinberger at first blocked Shultz who wanted very much to be Secretary of State After Alexander M Haig Jr turned out to be less than the kind of team player President Reagan wanted however Shultz was quickly called in  and the old rivalry flared The two strongwilled men remain civil but are personally estranged and are more at bureacratic swords points than were Henry A Kissinger and William P Rogers or Cyrus R Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski In all these cases the policy difference between the camps within an Administration is far less than between the Administration and the Outs but the intensity of that smaller difference is greater Weinberger has retained his lifelong scholarly interest in William Pitt the Younger  he admires the eloquence and doggedness of the man who became Englands Prime Minister at the age of 24  but many of Weinbergers old associates this writer included fear that he has suppressed what used to be an excellent sense of humor The bitterest State Defense policy disputes are conducted through what Washington calls the war of the Richards  Weinbergers Richard Perle Shultzs Richard R Burt  both young Assistant Secretaries equally ambitious both skilled manipulators of the media and blessed with a jungle cunning that would be unseemly if exhibited in their bosses Here is the paradox The pragmatic Shultz whose comparatively conciliatory manner and force of intellect is attractive to centrists and nonhawks advocates the application of military power in those instances where terrorism strikes and diplomacy alone is not enough The abrasively ideological and anti Soviet Weinberger whose grim defense of the defense budget makes him an ogre to moderates is the advocate of the most severe limitation of the use of military power to the point of setting out principles for engagement that seem to bar anything but a popular allout war For the first time we have a smooth hawk at the Fudge Factory and a stern dove at the Puzzle Palace Will President Reagan stern firer of the unruly Al Haig true believer in official family harmony tolerate this sort of armwrestling on the Cabinet table throughout his second term He will serenely pretend if the first term is a guide to ignore the WeinbergerShultz imbroglio and all the other blood feuds dismissing them as a lot of newspaper talk They are blood feuds White House chief of staff James A Baker 3d wants to leave his present post preferably for William Caseys job at the CIA they dont speak or any good Cabinet post if no opening appears hes likely to be gone before the end of the year to run for the governorship of Texas after trying to arrange for a replacement at the White House like the efficient Drew Lewis formerly Secretary of Transportation and now in private business Bakers astute deputy Richard G Darman wants the OMB but more conservative Reaganauts despise him as some sort of Elliot Richardson moderate mole and Treasury Secretary Regan asked the President after a damaging leak he attributed to Darman for no more staff at Cabinet meetings The ShultzBakerDarman crowd is at loggerheads with the WeinbergerCaseyMeese crowd as in Presidential adviser Edwin Meese 3d and the tugging and hauling is best symbolized in the fight to get a central role in foreign policymaking for Jeane J Kirkpatrick Ambassador to the United Nations and heroine of the hawks I think Reagan will not come down firmly on one side or the other because like Franklin D Roosevelt he enjoys the juggling that suits his style Accordingly he will probably offer Jeane Kirkpatrick a Cabinetlevel job but not the line job she wants and as Henry Kissinger used to say Never take a job without an In box In the next term Reagan will continue to preside rather than engage to place himself in the position of arbiter rather than advocate The inner circle will inevitably draw tighter as Reagan intimates like William P Clark and Michael K Deaver  who in the crucible of the White House came to despise each other  depart his official family As lameduck pressures mount and his inner and outer circles begin to think seriously about Life After Reagan the President is likely to rely more on the policy counsel of his friend Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada and when it comes to personnel on Nancy Reagan who may wind up more of a power than even Rosalynn Carter Between Weinberger and Shultz since no question exists about either mans personal loyalty or toughness of mind no final choice need ever be made by a President who likes and respects both Their running debate about what Shultz calls the ethics of power offers the only real intellectual ferment in town The goals of both men are Reagans goals though their approaches differ markedly the secondterm Reagan will lean first one way then the other To stay on course you dont hold the wheel of your car rigidly you turn slightly one way then the other In foreign policy then will a secondterm Reagan be the denouncer of the evil empire or the tolerant incipient summiteer The answer both The Shultz influence will usually predominate because SecState offers his boss a flexibility that SecDef lacks and Shultz knows how to stay connected to his only power source the President will need more solutions than positions Yet Reagans favorite speech seems to remain the rough goingover he gave imperialist Communism in London two years ago He returned only last month to calling for the steady expansion of human freedom that remains the moral core of our foreign policy characterizing the Soviet Unions denials of religious expression as brutal affronts to the human conscience That rhetoric which came from the heart drew no media attention in the midst of the stirrings of a new diplomatic demarche It will be heard again The best bets are that the RussianCuban penetration of this hemisphere will be stoutly resisted with the contra forces in Nicaragua supported one way or another the Reagan men see no such luck as an overt invasion by Nicaragua of one of its neighbors which would invite prompt and decisive United States intervention In the Middle East the onceburned Shultz will be twiceshy of putting his faith in vague Arab assurances but will speak for Reagan in demanding that Israel take long steps toward economic reform before agreeing to a substantial aid increase In the relations between the superpowers  after the first flush of optimism this year perhaps augmented by a joint celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Allied triumph over the Nazis in May  armscontrol talks will ultimately face a long and rocky road Their success will depend less on Reagans desire for a happy summit conclusion to his Presidency than on the postChernenko Soviet leaderships willingess to break new ground on verification methods  for example onsite inspection  as well as defensive cooperation A RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES  BUT WHICH TRADITIONS The haziest but most emotionally appealing of President Reagans firstterm goals was the return to traditional values a neo Pauline phrase meaning all things to all people since traditions and values in a diverse nation differ widely In general this promise reached out to embrace those seeking oldfashioned leadership opposing abortion denouncing permissive judges pressing to include prayer in schools calling for balanced budgets and an end to welfarism The Reagan appeal was to the legion of Americans vaguely discontented with the way their world has changed in the past 40 years Only in providing a needed sense of direction has Reagan delivered on his values promise in his first term He displayed his personal grace and courage after the attempt on his life showed he could be severe and unrelenting when he fired the air controllers and acted swiftly and relatively painlessly to prevent the spread of Communism to Grenada In all in his Teddy Roosevelt moments he gave macho back its good name Abortion has not been made a crime by constitutional amendment nor is it likely to be in the coming term as in the last the President can only give verbal support to a matter that is not in Presidential hands Nor can he deliver on prayer in schools although he takes credit for an equal access law that makes school facilities available after hours to religious groups as cults and other groups unpopular with local school boards take advantage of that law his move may backfire next term He has supported aid to parochial schools through a tuition tax credit but that has gone nowhere now it conflicts directly with his new philosophy of tax simplification and he will have to look for some other way to aid nonpublic elementary schools that does not conflict with the Constitution The steeply unbalanced budget remains an embarrassment to Mr Reagan who inveighed against lesser deficits all these years He recognizes red ink as a dismaying departure from traditional values and bridles at a secondterm goal of a deficit of only 100 billion or so Guiltily he will keep mentioning his support for a balanced budget amendment The movement to call a constitutional convention on this subject long underestimated will focus on Connecticut Michigan and Montana if two of those states join the others already in the balancers bag we will have a rush to pass the amendment in a Congress that wants no part of such a convention This mandated balanced budget is a long shot but could surprise in the next term One of the lines that drew unexpected applause in Richard Nixons 1968 stump speech was I promise to appoint a new Attorney General Big deal  every President does But the audience read a stopcoddling criminalsandtraitors meaning in his words If Reagans nominee Ed Meese makes it through Senate confirmation as expected we can expect a new and more controversial emphasis on law enforcement including a crackdown on embarrassing leaks Meese was the primary force behind National Security Decision Directive 84 which extended the use of the polygraph  the lie detector that often entraps the innocent and clears skilled liars  throughout the Federal Government NSDD 84 which was signed by Reagan and then withdrawn after Senate objection also required Government employees to sign lifelong pledges not to write about their experiences without clearance which was seen as a way to clamp down on public debate Many Reagan supporters  including the rightwing Heritage Foundation which usually reflects Meeses thinking  want to see this antimedia antileaker directive reinstated and envision a Meese Justice Department zealously enforcing it Others remember the corruption invited and the good men in Government ruined when plumbers were encouraged The Presidents firstterm defense of his longtime aide Ed Meese against charges of conflict of interest after his nomination to head the Justice Department suggests a continuance in the next four years of a value that has not lately been so traditional politically protecting your own The President feels that too many good men have been hounded out of office unfairly a top aide explains That means the President plans to hang tough and not abandon Secretary of Labor Raymond J Donovan who is under indictment and will defend all his nominees and appointees short of criminal conviction Some see that as a blindness to ethical standards other see it as defiance of the civil libertarians who got Nixon Hanging tough is a debatable value but it is a value and we will see plenty of it ACTUARIES SAY that Reagan has a 75 percent chance of surviving his next four years But who calls that livin  if his power drains from him in each passing year and voters look ahead to the next men and the newer policies Assuming good health no more than an average recession and no war or major humiliation by terrorists  in other words even better luck than in his first term  Reagan can figure on two years of dominance one year of rapid decline of power and a final year of nearirrelevance whether his popularity declines precipitately during his second term like Harry S Trumans down 40 percent or moderately like Eisenhowers down 14 percent He can threaten to punish his opponents in the off year of 1986 which adds piquancy to his political requests up to then after that he loses his whip It would be uncharacteristic of him to try to designate a successor as Truman did to his chagrin In his time of political dominance we can look forward to a President mindful of his central ideas whether or not they appeal to his articulate critics He will remain determined to hold down inflation to restore growth incentives by using a reluctance to tax combined with a fear of the deficit to curb increases in spending He will use his growing American strategic strength as a lever in negotiating genuine arms reductions and will resist the temptation to make an ambiguous deal for popularitys sake In his time of strolling into the sunset Reagan may be able to overcome the impotence of the lame duck by appearing to be above the political battle that will be taking place all around from mid 1987 on In that stance he could fence one of his central ideas and advocate it successfully If he continues on the general course he has set in his first term if his fabled luck holds if only he can articulate some of his themes clearly inspirationally and not schmaltzily in his second inaugural address  his fellow Americans will have reason to anticipate a time of relative stability at home and continued peace in the world

SECURITY TIGHTENED AT ABORTION CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/nyregion/security-tightened-at-abortion-clinics.html,ABORTION providers throughout the state have begun to increase security after two bomb threats at a West Hartford clinic earlier this month  Clinics are hiring security guards checking suspicious envelopes for letter bombs adding new outdoor lights and building limitedaccess entrances Several clinics have set up routines for dealing with threatening strangers who walk in According to these routines the receptionists are to alert the clinic by paging a nonexistent doctor whose fictitious name is known to all employees Doctors are to remove white coats to avoid identification as kidnapping targets while someone in the building notifies the police The abortion providers say the West Hartford incidents coupled with threats and vandalism at their own clinics have forced them to take more seriously the nationwide spread of antiabortion violence Operators of nine clinics formed the Connecticut Coalition of Abortion Providers last March to discuss security after bombings at clinics in other states and after various antiabortion groups began demonstrating outside their offices on Saturday mornings  Members agreed at this months meeting to take stronger security measures after bomb threats Jan 1 and 2 were received by the Summit Womens Center West in West Hartford The telephoned threats forced police to clear out the Bishops Corner shopping mall where the clinic is situated No bomb was found We were waiting for something like this to happen said Diane Martell executive director of the Connecticut Chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action League and a member of the coalition Now it has  Coalition members have begun working closely with local police departments and with the Hartford Office of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms of the Federal Treasury Department which has advised them on increasing security precautions We are giving this a priority at least for a while until it settles down said Richard E Smith resident agent in charge of the office He said the rash of bombings across the country and the volatility of the abortion issue make the threats to Connecticut clinics of particular concern More than 18000 legal abortions were reported in the state in 1983 according to Hugh Fritch a research analyst with the community health division of the State Health Department The number has steadily risen from the 15000 provided in 1980 he said About half of them were performed at the nine abortion clinics licensed by the state the rest at hospitals and in doctors offices Clinic operators say the recent threats have left them as Elaine Weisberg administrator of medical options in Stamford put it a combination of angry and frightened Nobody feels theyre going to walk out she said Its a funny kind of push and pull Theyre angry that people could do this And frightened for selfpreservation Laura Minor administrator of the West Hartford clinic said her anger has reinforced her determination to continue running the Summit Womens Center though with some changes in security  She said the center is having a new limitedaccess entrance built with a buzzer system inspecting suspicious packages hiring a security guard for the first time tape recording and tracing suspicious phone calls and placing threatening letters in plastic bags for police fingerprinting I have a family she said Im concerned this will spread to my home life Of course it has passed through my mind Why am I working here But I live in a democracy and shouldnt have to deal with terrorism I cant be quiet The West Hartford clinic is picketed each Saturday morning by the Hartfordbased Defenders Of the Unborn which urges incoming pregnant women to reconsider having abortions and plays continuous recordings of Taps outside the clinics windows Though the two organizations have been at odds Father Joseph Looney treasurer of the antiabortion group and pastor of St Justins Roman Catholic Church expressed sympathy for threatened clinics But he argued that the publics sympathy has been narrowly focused The media is making a big deal out of this he said Theyre sympathetic about bricks through windows and not the babies Of course we regret violence  its a terrible thing to have violence done to you I have sympathy for people who undergo violence which is why were against abortion The violence of abortion has been covered up Several Planned Parenthood clinics have reported acts of violence including broken windows and torn down signs Im very concerned that contraceptive patients would decide not to come and find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy said Leslie Wright director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Connecticut which has 20 clinics but performs abortions in only three of them An official of one abortion clinic after checking on the credentials of a reporter before agreeing to speak to him said she preferred to keep her clinics name out of the newspaper anyway Recent threats have made her nervous about publicity she said
POLITICS;   CAMPAIGN SPENDING ASSESSED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/nyregion/politics-campaign-spending-assessed.html,REPRESENTATIVE Robert J Mrazek and Robert P Quinn in their heated campaign for Long Islands 3d Congressional District seat last November called each other big spenders They were both right according to the latest figures on file with the Federal Elections Commission in Washington Theirs was easily the costliest campaign on Long Island There was one big difference in their spending however Mr Quinn the Republican challenger mostly used his own money Mr Mrazek the Democratic incumbent mostly used other peoples primarily from political action committees Democrats have often made issues of Republican acceptance of money from political action committees but Mr Mrazek outdid almost all Republicans and Democrats He was one of 19 members of the House who raised more than 300000 each from political action committees for the 198384 period according to Ralph Naders Congress Watch The level of spending by Mr Mrazek and Mr Quinn was one of several significant points in the Federal Election Commission postelection report on the five Long Island congressional races Others included the following  Another Democrat Representative Thomas J Downey also proved to be a big spender  and saver Even after spending 409933 for the 1984 race he had 165716 in the bank to start future campaign fundraising A Nassau County Republican Representative Norman F Lent had a similarly large amount left over 186847 Such bank accounts also serve to discourage future opponents many of whom  unless they are wealthy  have to start from scratch with their fundraising  The growing influence of the political action committees was seen in all the Long Island candidates reports with the committees gradually replacing individual donors This is happening not only with incumbents but also with challengers who were given little chance of winning and who thus had difficulty raising funds  The increasing amount of outof state money contributed to the candidates and particularly to incumbents confirmed the trend toward national members of Congress who spend almost all of the year in Washington and only make occasional trips back to their home districts The FEC reports were in effect a fiscal pulsetaking of the House of Representatives campaigns on the Island last November Except for the MrazekQuinn race the voting followed the same pattern as the money In the 1st District Representative William J Carney the Conservative Republican incumbent outspent his unsuccessful Democratic rival George J Hochbrueckner 326171 to 196359 Mr Carney wound up his campaign with a surplus of 22196 Mr Hochbrueckner with a deficit of 29301 Mr Hochbrueckner had also invested 7500 of his own funds in his losing effort In the 2d District Mr Downey outspent Paul Anaboli his Republican challenger by 409933 to 146708 Mr Anaboli fell considerably short of the amount he said Suffolk Republican leaders had promised to raise to encourage him to take on the difficult race Mr Anaboli ended the campaign with 14441 in debts Much of his money came from outofstate political action committees representing the influence not of local GOP leaders but of Richard Bond a consultant to Mr Anaboli in Washington In the 3d District Mr Quinn a multimillionaire who decided to try public life after early retirement from a career in finance spent 734339 including 450000 of his own money Mr Mrazek came close with 626256 Mr Mrazek was left with 47467 to begin fundraising if he runs in 1986 Outofstate political action committees accounted for almost half of Mr Mrazeks campaign funds In the 4th District Mr Lent spent a relatively modest 177099 while his Democratic opponent Sheldon Englehard spent 51689 About onefifth of Mr Englehards funds  10000  came from one union the United Food and Commercial Workers with other unions also helping to keep his campaign afloat Two of Mr Lents biggest contributors were the political action committees of the American Medical Association and the New York Medical Association which gave a total of 5000 In the 5th District Representative Raymond J McGrath spent 166854 to 78546 for his Democratic opponent Michael DInnocenzo Mr McGrath was left with 28059 in the bank and Mr DInnocenzo with bills of 7945 The Democrat contributed about 5000 of his own to his losing effort Mr McGrath received a total of 7500 from the medical associations Almost all of the campaign money went for advertising usually in weekly newspapers and on radio and to pay printing and postage costs for the avalanche of political mail that fell on Long Islanders in the weeks before the election Mr Quinn in particular also invested in television advertising as well as considerable radio time to transform himself from a political unknown to a political celebrity at least in the 3d District On one day alone Oct 22 Mr Quinn spent 166000 to purchase television and radio time according to his election commission report Among the big PAC contributions to Mr Mrazek were 9750 from the American Federation of Teachers and 9400 from the National Education Association One committee the Realtors PAC was probably the most active overall although it leaned heavily toward incumbents The group gave 5300 to Mr Mrazek 5000 to Mr Carney who is at the other end of the political spectrum 4250 to Mr Lent 3500 to Mr Downey and 1500 to Mr McGrath Most of the political action committees are associated with unions and businesses but some are linked to specific issues such as abortion The National Right to Life Political Action Committee gave 2500 each to Mr Anaboli and Mr Quinn while Mr Mrazek received a total of 3500 from two groups on the other side of the issue Citizens for Family Planning and Voters for a Choice Mr Mrazek was plainly uncomfortable in an interview with the level of the PAC contributions to him He said that he would not have had to go to committees if he had not been opposed by two millionaires  Mr Quinn and John LeBoutillier the Republican incumbent who was defeated by Mr Mrazek in 1982 He said that he would favor campaign spending limitations but as long as we have this system Ive got to remain competitive The Centerport Democrat said that he did not take money from any group that I wasnt compatible with philosophically He said that there were committees that demanded cosponsorship of legislation the group favored in return for contributions but that he had not done any such bargaining
CATHOLIC BISHOP SUES ON ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/us/catholic-bishop-sues-on-abortions.html,The Roman Catholic Bishop of Albany has obtained a temporary court order blocking efforts by two Planned Parenthood clinics to begin providing abortions Attorneys for the Bishop Howard J Hubbard got the order Friday afternoon just hours after Planned Parenthood had received approval from the State Health Department to offer abortions at clinics in Albany and Hudson The order by State Supreme Court Justice John Pennock bars the department from issuing a final operating license to Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood pending a hearing Jan 25 In a statement Bishop Hubbard accused the Health Department of failing to follow correct procedures in approving Planned Parenthoods application But he also noted his churchs theological rejection of abortion The Catholic Church in the Diocese of Albany remains unswerving in our commitment to protect the life of the defenseless unborn Bishop Hubbard said We will continue our strong opposition to the abortionondemand philosophy which the proposed Planned Parenthood abortion clinic represents and we will expand our already substantial services which provide alternatives to abortion Russell Shaw secretary for public affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington said yesterday that he did not know of any other diocese that had tried to block the opening of an abortion clinic by going to court The conference he said does not have a formal position on the kind of action taken by Bishop Hubbard However he said our assumption would be that the diocese is acting prudently and reasonably in insisting on strict enforcement of the law as it pertains to abortion facilities Ruth Klepper executive director of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood criticized the diocese for trying to use this in some ways as a test case She added They want to say No more abortions in Albany County But beyond that they want to say No more abortion I think their position is intolerant Increasing Protests The Bishops action comes after a year of debate on how forcefully the Roman Catholic Church should extend its opposition to abortion into the public arena Governor Cuomo and Geraldine A Ferraro the Democratic candidate for Vice President clashed with senior officials of the church including Archbishop John J OConnor of New York on aspects of the issue In recent months some opponents of abortion have resorted to violence Last year according to lawenforcement officials 24 abortion clinics were bombed or otherwise attacked The violence has been deplored by the bishops conference and on Jan 3 President Reagan condemned the rash of bombings as violent anarchist activities The Upper Hudson branch of Planned Parenthood provides family planning and gynecological services and venerealdisease testing for 12000 people a year in the counties of Albany Columbia Greene and Rensselaer The Health Department which licenses health facilities and the services they provide initially approved Planned Parenthoods application to provide abortion services at two clinics on Dec 23 1983 Protests Prompted a Hearing Last summer before Planned Parenthood was ready to provide services at the two clinics several parties including the diocese protested to the department that the application had not been adequately publicized and that they had not been given a chance to voice their opposition The diocese embraces 14 upstate counties in eastern and central New York and numbers 400000 Catholics and 200 parishes Bowing to the protests the State Health Department held a public hearing Nov 9 in Albany At the hearing representatives of the diocese argued that the Health Department had not met the three criteria for approving an application They contended that the department had failed to prove there was a need for abortion services and had not investigated Planned Parenthoods finances or its competence to perform abortions In essence what we discovered was that a summary kind of investigation was done that amounted to a noninvestigation said the Rev Michael A Farano Chancellor of the diocese It was given a very quick brushover Decline in Abortions One of the dioceses main arguments was that there was no need for a clinic because the number of abortions in the four counties had declined from 2500 in 1981 to 1900 in 1983 Officials of Planned Parenthood did not dispute that figure but pointed out that women had been forced to travel to other counties for abortions because abortions in the fourcounty area were available only in hospitals and doctors offices Hospitals are not the place for early abortions said Miss Klepper They are expensive not confidential threatening and hard to get appointments in Hospitals she said charge 200 to 700 for an abortion not including physician fees Planned Parenthood plans to charge 200 The Health Department agreed with Planned Parenthood Raymond Sweeney director of the Office of Health Systems Management said in a telephone interview yesterday Forty percent of the residents of Albany go outside the county to seek abortion services while in most other

LIBERALS' POSITION ON ABORTION IS EXPLAINED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/nyregion/l-liberals-position-on-abortion-is-explained-204144.html,Why asks Dorothy McLaughlin are liberals who defend the civil rights of a wide variety of people and animals unable to apply those rights to the unborn as well Obviously some liberals such as the two cited at the beginning of her article do feel that a fetus has civil rights This is not surprising because abortion is an issue on which a persons views may not correspond with those on the range of civil libertarian causes recited by Mrs McLaughlin In this it is like capital punishment which is favored by many who oppose abortion on sanctityoflife grounds and opposed by many who favor the right to choose abortion It is unlikely that all those who would otherwise admit to the label liberal would agree on a single answer Here is mine RICHARD P HALL Summit
Liberals' Position On Abortion Is Explained,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/nyregion/l-liberals-position-on-abortion-is-explained-212126.html,The Right to Life position should not be a liberal cause as Dorothy McLaughlin wrote in her Opinion Page article Dec 23 It is true that liberals have worked for many causes frequently supporting the poor the weak the disenfranchised and minorities They work to improve the human condition and occasionally even support endangered animals because they are part of our total natural environment Liberals have an order of priorities and oppressed humans are at the top A woman with an unwanted pregnancy that interferes with her ability to work and support herself andor her other children and whose ability to make decisions is interfered with by a political group is oppressed Right to Life on the other hand is a name chosen by a political group concerned with denying the right to sex education to birthcontrol information and the right of choice about an unwanted pregnancy and ignoring the rights of all except inutero humans Clearly their name is a misnomer and belies the behavior of this group which has resorted to techniques ranging from malicious namecalling to outright terrorism including bombings Post partum humans have no rights in the eyes of RighttoLife advocates Objecting to abortion on moral grounds and admitting that a woman has a right to choose for herself are not mutually exclusive positions There are liberals who do not condone abortion but are aware that the Constitution guarantees women freedom of choice this group would certainly prefer to prevent unwanted pregnancies thereby limiting the number of unwanted and often abused children And there are conservatives who cannot see the incongruity in violence against United States citizens in the name of preventing the termination of a pregnancy As a liberal I too deplore that some women see abortion as necessary I would prefer to see pregnancies prevented by education and contraception And I would be more willing to believe the sincerity of Right to Life advocates when I hear them offering preventive help or even volunteering to care for support and love those unwanted infants of any ethnic origin from birth to age 18 EDNA L KAHN RN Medford
FEELING BOTH WELL AND GOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/books/feeling-both-well-and-good.html,Frederika Randall is deputy editor of The Home Section of The New York Times THE NEW OUR BODIES OURSELVES A Book by and for Women By The Boston Womens Health Book Collective Illustrated 647 pp New York TouchstoneSimon  Schuster Paper 1295 WOMEN COMING OF AGE By Jane Fonda with Mignon McCarthy Illustrated 446 pp New York Simon  Schuster 1995 In 1969 the Boston Womens Health Book Collective began to compile a curious sort of selfhelp guide by and for women that would prove as influential in its way as anything in the literature  from The Second Sex to The Golden Notebook  that shaped the political awareness of women in the 1970s Our Bodies Ourselves written by a group of knowledgeable nonprofessionals was commercially published in 1973 and over the years became a best seller  more than two and a quarter million copies to date in the United States with foreign editions in 11 languages including Hebrew Swedish and Greek Ostensibly just a thoroughly researched sourcebook on topics ranging from childbirth to the health care system the book had implications far beyond medical advice It sought to define a feminine perspective on sexuality motherhood and aging It encouraged women to reassess the symbolic meanings and the value  productive and reproductive  attributed to the female body and to strike a new bargain about how they would serve the family the economy and the culture A womans capacity to be a full participant in society the book suggested depended on greater control of her physical being including reproductive choice and her ability to defend against assault It was a fresh and effective line of attack in a campaign which began with the Victorians against the belief that a womans duties and rights were limited by her biological nature The New Our Bodies Ourselves is a revised and expanded version with new chapters on environmental and occupational health alcohol and drugs new technologies such as in vitro fertilization and on alternatives such as acupuncture to established medicine Although considerably longer 647 pages compared with the 383 of the previous edition the new version closely follows the format and philosophy of the earlier book Times have changed but the approach of the Boston Womens Health Book Collective has not  or not much That is the virtue of the new version and also its failing It is a virtue because some of the first editions premises still hold true  women still need both information to evaluate the competing demands work and family make on their physical energies and facts to confront the images and myths television and advertising frequently offer as representative of feminine nature And women need to protect themselves against the misuses of medicine  too many tranquilizers hysterectomies and other commonly overprescribed cures Yet despite many strong sections The New Our Bodies Ourselves seems to hark back to a sunny expansive time 15 years ago when women were discovering what the authors call the family of women when collective enterprise and sisterhood seemed to be goals in themselves as much as strategies for change With its poems and personal accounts cartoons medical illustrations and photos of women the volume has the flavor of a family scrapbook in which a few too many passing enthusiasms have been faithfully preserved and pasted When Our Bodies Ourselves was first published this homespun approach made sense but today one longs for a clearer more coherent point of view The authors emphasis on medicine as a paramount agent of social control for example seems narrow Skepticism about the medical establishment and reliance on the warmth of friendships may simply be grim necessities for poor women who cannot get jobs at living wages or day care for their children so they can hold those jobs or any health care at all in an era when Medicaid benefits are shrinking Today the issues of choice involved in pregnancy and childbirth go beyond birth positions and anesthetics What about maternity leaves paternity leaves womens wage scales and job security day care The last is allotted four pages To devote the same attention to psychic healing and sexual fantasies as is given to health at work and domestic violence seems too innocent an approach for the 1980s when abortion clinics are being bombed when the political opposition to the womens movement is as organized as the movement itself was in the 1970s Indeed Our Bodies Ourselves has been one of the primary targets of fundamentalist campaigns to ban certain books from libraries around the country Perhaps it is unfair to ask that a selfhelp guide provide leadership in shaping issues for women today The New Our Bodies Ourselves remains an excellent source for a woman evaluating medical care The thorough references and bibliography provide invaluable information for a wide range of women And to give credit where credit is amply due it is because of the efforts of just such dedicated groups as the Boston Womens Health Book Collective that womens issues have moved from the private to the public political sphere today Women Coming of Age by Jane Fonda with Mignon McCarthy is a less ambitious more conventional guide to womens health by a writer whose talents as a bestselling author are well proved It covers the physical and psychological aspects of aging as it begins in the 40s Chapters on nutrition exercise and menopause are simple and succinct  reflecting a generous sympathy for women in the middle of life  healthy survivors the author writes in a culture that rejects us and that does not want our full participation There are Miss Fondas personal remedies tea bags for puffy eyes and her exercise regime as well as a useful list of sources for help with problems from smoking to pensions to voter registration Dont expect the complexity of Simone de Beauvoirs reflections on age or for that matter the engaged energy of the Boston Womens Health Book Collective But in that general category of popular books that play upon our most elementary fears and embarrassments with advice on how to achieve thinner thighs neater eyebrows better relationships or a better opinion of ourselves this is a sensitive and informative exception B
LIBERALS' POSITION ON ABORTION IS EXPLAINED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/nyregion/l-liberals-position-on-abortion-is-explained-212138.html,Dorothy McLaughlin says prochoice advocates ignore the rights of the people living in utero and argues that it would be logical for those who have generally taken the side of others hard pressed to fight for themselves to espouse the Right to Life cause If the right to life were truly a right its exercise would be discretionary As espoused by pro lifers it is really a duty  the duty to experience life no matter how painful it promises to be Prochoicers fight against the imposition of that duty they fight to have society recognize that it has as much responsibility to the unborn for imposing life as it has for withholding it DALE MURAD River Edge
FAST START FOR A STATE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/14/style/fast-start-for-a-state-s-attorney-general.html,When people in Rhode Island call their states Attorney General simply the General the term seems tailor made for Arlene Violet A former nun who in November became the first woman to be elected Attorney General in the United States she has taken on her new job with the zeal of a field marshal She has been in office only since Jan 1 but she has already made headlines with her decision to retry Claus von Bulow on charges that he attempted to murder his wife a wealthy Manhattan socialite In addition Miss Violet has taken steps to bring to trial longpending cases involving accusations of political corruption and she has been meeting with Federal state and local law enforcement officials to develop a coordinated strategy for dealing with the heavy concentration of organized crime and drug traffic in the state I think it is important to set the tone when you are in office and that is what I am attempting to do said Miss Violet who is 41 years old During the years she was an energetic public interest lawyer before her election she said she was known as Attila the Nun Her experience representing the disabled environmentalists and consumers she said has shaped her attitude toward the job of Attorney General I basically see the job as a public interest job she said My overarching perspective is that its about time the criminal justice system was responsive to the needs of victims of crime My priority is street crime Miss Violet said she has more than a theoretical understanding of life on the street and crime the result of years of living in every high crime section of Rhode Island I wanted to understand what was being experienced by people particularly poor people said Miss Violet who had to resign from her order the Sisters of Mercy to run for Attorney General Living in those highcrime areas which were highvictim areas as well developed in me a commitment to do something about the criminal justice system Miss Violet said one of her goals is to obtain speedy trials in high trauma crimes particularly assaults on the elderly and rapes If you dont try them right away you can kiss them goodbye she said Two years later a woman is not interested in testifying in a rape trial Close behind her interest in street crime she said are the problems of political corruption and organized crime Providence has long been a principal center for organized crime in New England Organized crime is coupled with political corruption Miss Violet said You cant have organized crime without payoffs to officials Although she intends to be aggressive in the area of organized crime Miss Violet says she is operating under no delusions You never get rid of organized crime she said but you make them so uncomfortable that they move I tell people I am Machiavellian enough to want some other Attorney General to have the headache for a while Decision for a Retrial Miss Violets decision to retry Mr von Bulow was announced on her fifth day in office I believe there is probative evidence which if believed by a jury would result in conviction she said This is going to be a credibility trial Mr von Bulow who remains free on 1 million bail and lives in his wifes Fifth Avenue apartment is to go on trial April 2 In March 1982 a jury in Newport RI found Mr von Bulow guilty of twice injecting his wife Martha with insulin in attempts to kill her Mrs von Bulow who is in a New York hospital has been in a coma since December 1980 Last April the Rhode Island Supreme Court overturned the conviction saying that some of the drugs found in a black bag in Mr von Bulows closet in the couples Newport mansion had been analyzed without a search warrant and should not have been admitted as evidence The court remanded the case to the Superior Court clearing the way for a new trial Ive read everything that exists on von Bulows case Miss Violet said In my mind what it really came down to was the major contention of the medical evidence Alan M Dershowitz the Harvard Law School professor who argued Mr von Bulows appeal has called Miss Violets decision a political one Miss Violet dismissed Mr Dershowitzs statement as showmanship People who know me Arlene Violet know that I do not make political decisions she said I try to call a shot exactly the way it is Miss Violet who was defeated in her first campaign for Attorney General in 1982 won only narrowly in November Her margin was 6000 votes out of nearly 400000 cast She campaigned on the Republican ticket but took some positions that were out of step with her party She supported passage of the equal rights amendment creation of individual retirement accounts for homemakers and the concept that men and women should be paid the same wages for comparable work She also said she will enforce a womans right to have an abortion as long as it is legal Miss Violet was born in Providence the daughter of a Republican alderman who gave food and money to the poor I grew up with that sense that you are here to serve people she said I consider that the best tradition of politics After high school Miss Violet joined the Sisters of Mercy an order known for its social activism For several years she lived in a convent and wore a traditional habit In 1966 she graduated from Salve Regina College in Newport RI and became a teacher in an innercity Catholic junior high school InnerCity Work Later she did innercity work on behalf of the elderly an experience that she said led to her decision to go to law school at Boston College She financed her legal education by scholarships and money earned during summer internships Miss Violet graduated in 1974 becoming one of the first nuns in the nation to earn a law degree Her first job as a lawyer was as a clerk for Justice Thomas Paolino of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Next she worked in the Attorney Generals office where she headed the consumer fraud unit The following year she opened her own public interest law firm Miss Violet resigned from the Sisters of Mercy in January 1984 after the Bishop of Providence Louis E Gellineau said he agreed with Pope John Paul II that priests and nuns should not hold public office It was a traumatic decision for me Miss Violet said I knew that if I chose to run for political office the Bishop would move to have me excluded It came down to being a Sister of Mercy in name only or of being one in reality Miss Violet whose victory was one of the few achieved by women running for political office last fall said she finds it ironic that Rhode Island is one of two states  Maryland is the other  where the Attorney General has the most authority In other states there are district attorneys who do the prosecution she explained In Rhode Island she said the Attorney General is responsible for all the felony prosecutions and some district court prosecutions She is very conscious of being in the spotlight as the first woman to hold the job of Attorney General I dont want to do a poor job because I dont want to foreclose other talented women from having this position she said I just want to make sure I keep the position open for them I want to do a good job
"HOSPITAL CARE OF THE DYING: EACH DAY, PAINFUL CHOICES",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/14/nyregion/hospital-care-of-the-dying-each-day-painful-choices.html,Two schoolteachers four drug addicts a retired opera singer a college student a butcher a former police officer three housekeepers a homeless alcoholic a wealthy executive three dressmakers a retired longshoreman a convicted thief and 123 other patients died in one month at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center Some of these men and women died without warning But nearly half spent weeks knowing that death was imminent And some died only after doctors nurses hospital attorneys and families  ill equipped to deal with the agonizing ethical issues  found themselves having to choreograph the precise time and manner for life to end Years ago death was a statement of fact today it has become a dilemma of agonizing choices That is true not just in a few wellpublicized cases but also for ordinary people in ordinary circumstances Decisions Faced by Doctors Every day doctors are asked to balance odds of survival fears of malpractice lawsuits family guilt and their own personal sense of ethics in determining the care of the dying And although it is seldom discussed openly doctors are struggling with an ingredient that for generations was not a part of their decisions about life and death money The cost of keeping the St Lukes Roosevelt patients alive in their final days  the respirators heart monitors blood tests bedpans pain killers liver scans cotton swabs  averaged more than 15000 About 28 percent of the nations 75 billion yearly Medicare budget now goes to maintaining people in their last year of life and the bulk of that is spent during the last month For these 143 patients the cost amounted to nearly 2 million about 10 percent of the hospital centers total monthly operating budget With healthcare costs hovering near 11 percent of the gross national product economists politicians and others are questioning whether the money is being spent effectively An examination of the 143 deaths at St LukesRoosevelt in the typical month of June 1984 suggests that the process of dying at a modern hospital has undergone a transformation greater than the public realizes and greater than most academic studies reflect The examination is based on analysis of the patients medical charts and on interviews with scores of doctors family members and officials of the medical center on Manhattans Upper West Side When and whether to disconnect respirators to resuscitate to start special feedings to treat infections to withhold dialysis to continue transfusions were everyday questions no longer the exception but the rule On some days doctors called the hospitals lawyers to help determine when and how patients should die Family members made appointments to stand at bedsides as patients were disconnected from respirators and while the talk frequently was of death with dignity and what patients would have wanted money was an undercurrent littlediscussed but always present Some patients hoping to guide the decisions that would be made about their own cases had written what was the equivalent of a living will a document delineating a patients wishes for treatment But at best such documents offer only a partial solution Legally New York State does not even recognize living wills And it remains unclear under what circumstances patients may refuse extraordinary life sustaining measures or what role family members may play in making these decisions To read through the charts of the 143 patients at StLukes Roosevelt is to embark on a grim odyssey One alternately travels the roads of tragedy hope despair guilt mourning denial resignation In page after page  through the scrawls of doctors and nurses the medical abbreviations the temperature charts pulse rates bloodgas ratios radiology reports  the courage and resilience of many of these men and women and their families emerge So does the humanity of many of the doctors nurses and social workers who treated them Probably the biggest issue we deal with is not death said Dr David Finley director of the intensive care unit at Roosevelt Hospital one of the centers two sites Its guilt Its fine for a family to say they want everything done Its too easy to say Do everything and go home Most people dont know what everything entails Ive wondered to myself if they would have to pay out of their own pocket would they pay for this care The Routine And the Tragic The month of June brought the final days of Claudia Valdarama a 21year old dental student from Colombia who was pregnant when she learned that she had leukemia Rejecting the idea of an abortion she started chemotherapy and gave birth on schedule to a healthy son She died six months later Here too was Robert Cordovi a 33 yearold construction worker who had been stabbed moments before he was to meet his girlfriend for a bicycle ride around Central Park and Hortense Harriet who 100 years old and blind nevertheless lived at home until her final days St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center  comprising the former St Lukes Hospital at Amsterdam Avenue and 113th Street and the former Roosevelt Hospital at 59th Street and Ninth Avenue  is an urban teaching hospital like many others It has 1315 beds and treats 46000 patients a year For the most part its patients are from the citys five boroughs and represent a broad economic mix They include accident victims cancer patients pediatric cases men women and children afflicted with illnesses of virtually every kind There were 3659 patients in June the vast majority of whom survived The 143 patients who died at the hospital included 11 in the emergency room Four others were dead by the time they arrived at the hospital Permission From Families St LukesRoosevelt made available the medical charts of the patients who died with the names of the patients deleted Names were released to a reporter only when the hospital had got permission from the families It was to St LukesRoosevelt that Rene PalmaGil was brought  a 5monthold boy who while napping one afternoon suddenly stopped breathing a victim of sudden infant death syndrome Here too came a 63 yearold immigrant from Hong Kong who was struck by a truck as he crossed Amsterdam Avenue Here was Grace Nover 77 who had taught Spanish for many years at Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx and who died after suffering for years from lung disease and kidney failure Here was an otherwise healthy 40 yearold woman suddenly in a coma and brain dead from a blood clot whose family wanted every possible technological intervention Here was Daniel Esteves a 15monthold blind and braindamaged child whose parents had known from the day he was born that he would have only months to live The doctor asked me if I wanted heroic measures said Norberto Esteves Daniels father a welfare caseworker for the city And I said yes I said yes because I am a parent Because I dont want my child to die I love my child I dont want him to die The cost of hospitalization during Daniels brief life was 20473 The cost to take care of Mrs Valdarama was 8448545 The cost for Miss Harriet was 25000 The cost for Mrs Nover was 59546 Covered by Insurance The vast majority of patients were covered either by private insurance Medicaid the state and Federal Government program that provides health benefits to the poor or Medicare which provides benefits to the elderly and disabled Only 10 percent were not covered at all Yet nowhere on the pages of these patients medical charts was there any mention of money If treatment was withheld it was never because a patient appeared unable to pay and never directly because care was too expensive Nor was the degree of care a matter of age Patients 80 or 90 years old apparently received the same extensive treatment as patients in their 50s In fact nearly onethird of the patients who died in June at the hospital center were over the age of 80 and those patients were resuscitated and given other extraordinary lifesustaining treatments as aggressively as patients younger according to a statistical analysis of their records Miss Harriet for example at the age of 100 was treated in the intensive care unit and underwent surgery there Calvin Blanchard an 87yearold retired carpenter with arteriosclerosis was resuscitated not once but three times Clara Heller 88 who lived in a nursing home and had suffered for years from heart disease was resuscitated numerous times and was placed on a respirator Painful Choices On Resuscitation Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a lastresort procedure in which the heart is jolted into functioning after it has stopped It is done mechanically by applying pressure and electrical current Often patients who are resuscitated are also placed on respirators to help them breathe Each attempt at resuscitation costs 1500 an expense that was incurred by more than one third of the patients some repeatedly Whether and under what circumstances resuscitation and other expensive lifeextending measures should be withheld from terminally ill patients are questions now being reviewed by health economists ethicists and others Congress has commissioned a study of how lifesustaining technology is used to treat the elderly New York States Health Commissioner Dr David Axelrod has said that he plans to issue guidelines on circumstances in which lifesustaining support can be withheld These issues are to be considered in New York State by a panel called the Governors Task Force on Life and the Law But for now no clear guidelines exist Doctors hospital officials and others must decide these matters on their own They do so under apprehension about the possibility of malpractice litigation or even of prosecution on murder charges as well as their own discomfort at being placed in a position of terminating life rather than trying to preserve it Suggestion Crossed Out These anxieties and the lack of candor they foster are evident throughout the hospital centers charts In one instance that of a patient who clearly was terminally ill a doctor scribbled various options for treatment including shutting off the patients respirator the device that pumps air into the lungs when they are no longer capable of breathing on their own Then he crossed this suggestion out In another case that of Jean Frank a 75yearold former schoolteacher who had choked on food and was placed on a respirator medical records indicated that she died on June 11 Yet according to her brother Leonard and Miss Franks sister Florence the family was summoned to the hospital the following day June 12 where they stood at her bedside as doctors who had determined that the patient was brain dead disconnected her from the respirator None of this is mentioned in Miss Franks medical records Miss Franks case occurred before a recent Court of Appeals ruling redefining death in New York State in such a way that a patient whose brain has stopped functioning is considered dead even if heart and lung activity can be supported I could see her actually die Mr Frank recalled It was just amazing watching it  how the blood went away from her nose It was hard to believe She looked so beautiful The Hospital Instead of Home Upstairs in one of the rooms Mary Eisenberg an 88yearold retired seamstress lay dying Mrs Eisenberg who was suffering from pneumonia seemed oblivious to the tubes that fed antibiotics through her arm the needle in her back removing fluid from the cavity between her lungs and rib cage the onslaught of procedures to detect infection diminished brain function cardiac output There was a time  as recently as 50 years ago  when most people died at home But today the majority nearly 65 percent die in hospitals and that percentage is rising steadily Why Americans die in hospitals has much to do with custom Many people are not aware of hospices and other programs that provide care at home Others simply assume that when people are sick they should be taken to a hospital for care But there are also financial incentives to choose a hospital as the place to die Treatment at a nursing home for example generally is not covered by private insurance or Medicare An individual must deplete a lifes savings to qualify for Medicaid benefits She had always wanted to die at home with her family said Elsa Fater the niece of Hortense Harriet 100 years old who was brought to the hospital on May 5 after a bout of fainting But I couldnt keep her with me I couldnt leave her at home Medicare doesnt pay for custodial care So it comes out of your money A nursing home costs 3200 a month How much money do people have Emergency Surgery Almost two months innumerable tests surgery a stay in the intensive care unit and 25000 later Miss Harriet died Months later Mrs Fater was still disturbed that her aunt was placed in intensive care and subjected to emergency surgery Yet because Miss Harriet was in a hospital and not a nursing home Medicare paid virtually every last penny Joan McLain pleaded with officials at the Baptist Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx to let her mother Margaret Deane 92 die quietly at the home In the preceding two months she had already been hospitalized twice and had run up a bill of 9219 Her third and final hospitalization lasted two days and cost 900 all paid by Medicare I asked them not to send her back to the hospital Mrs McLain said I felt nothing was being accomplished It was just a miserable experience If a doctor could have helped her that would have been one thing But it wasnt This was the passing out of her life at 92 years of age and there was nothing to be gained by it Officials of the nursing home responded however that given Mrs Deanes acute symptoms of dehydration it was their obligation to send her to a hospital Haunted by Ordeal To this day Irving Nover is haunted by the ordeal his wife underwent in the hospital If I knew what I knew six weeks hence I would never have insisted she come to the hospital said Mr Nover a retired teacher at the Bronx High School of Science whose wife Grace 77 suffered from failure of the kidneys and lungs After being admitted to the hospital on May 28 she was placed on a dialysis machine and on a respirator She was fed by a tube that ran through her nose and into her stomach a so called nasalgastric or NG tube I probably would have said Do not put her on a respirator  do not torture her Mr Nover said She didnt take anything by mouth So they fed her with an NG tube She was constantly pulling at the tape trying to pull it out She pulled it out twice They put it in a third time It was a heartbreaking experience And all the time being practically certain she was slipping before your eyes For Relatives Impossible Choices Clara Heller 88 years old was on leave from a nursing home to attend her greatgranddaughters bas mitzvah She had forgotten to bring her heart medication and at about midnight at a Manhattan hotel she began having difficulty breathing Her daughter called an ambulance and Mrs Heller was rushed to Roosevelt Before the week was out she had been resuscitated three times After her heart stopped she was never the same said Marcia Cohen Mrs Hellers daughter I said Ma Ma Ma Who would want to live like that They resuscitated her again Is there sense My mother always said Dont keep me going like a vegetable She said God should help me I should just be able to finish my life on my two feet  Mrs Cohen finally asked that her mother not be resuscitated any more Mrs Heller died six hours later Requests Usually Met Mrs Cohen was not alone The families of nearly onefifth of the patients who died at St LukesRoosevelt in June had requested that resuscitation or other aggressive treatments be withheld  requests that according to the charts were usually met Some asked that the patients not be placed on respirators or transferred to the intensive care unit for aggressive treatment Others opposed invasive diagnostic devices such as the Swan Ganz  a catheter that is threaded through a major artery and into the heart Still others refused to allow surgery The doctor asked me said Olivia Carpender Olivia Daviss daughter And I told him if my mothers heart stopped beating I dont want them pounding on her chest and destroying her body any more than it was For what Revive her for another day or another two weeks I couldnt see that Not as long as I had anything to do with it Ethel Jiles a nurse at Roosevelt whose 71yearold aunt Cora Hill suffered from uterine cancer adamantly opposed resuscitation  I was totally against that Miss Jiles said I work in emergency I see no sense in it It seems so cruel It really is a lot of trauma The end is going to come anyway Miss Hill died on June 15 without resuscitation All Kinds of Tubes Rosa Caro said she pleaded with doctors not to place her 98yearold mother Maria Fernandez on all kinds of tubes Reginald Hart asked that doctors not operate a second time on his wife Inez a 63yearold cancer patient I called them one night and told them not to do anything because she didnt want to stay alive said Mr Hart who is a retired clerk The doctors complied Nunzio Tarantino a 63yearold longshoreman dying of lung cancer made the decision for himself He refused surgery to amputate his leg In virtually all these cases the decision to withhold care was reached jointly by the doctor and family Usually according to the patients medical charts the doctor explained the patients grim prognosis and asked whether the family wanted aggressive care or supportive care which is a euphemism for simply keeping a patient comfortable In some cases where only supportive care was requested families signed statements that they had refused certain treatments Yet for all the cases in which families requested treatment withheld there were many others that wanted everything possible done Im glad they brought him back said Annette Hodges of her grandfather Calvin Blanchard who suffered from heart disease and severe internal bleeding and who in his final days was only semiconscious He was old but it doesnt mean that he should stop living He was still alive and as long as hes still alive he should be saved Thats what doctors are for After the first resuscitation Mr Blanchard lived 10 days After the second he lived one day more The third effort was unsuccessful Disagreement And Silence If it were possible for a patient and a physician to simply reach a private agreement decisions about care would not be so difficult Often however it is a subject that is not broached Often patients and physicians disagree Often families disagree among themselves Patients disagree with families Family members change their minds This is from a doctors notes about a 74yearold patient admitted from a nursing home in Manhattan May 25 Reached her brother Denied consent for tracheotomy A tracheotomy is an incision in the throat in this case to accommodate a respirator May 29 Now on TPN feeding via tubes through the heart May 30 Unable to reach brother today so far re trach but he has indicated that he will continue to refuse in view of her overall poor prognosis Will keep trying May 31 Today contacted brother Today he consents to tracheotomy No Real Purpose The procedure was performed Twentythree days later the patient died Her total hospital bill was 73368 In another case the brother of a 56 yearold man suffering from AIDS had asked based on the patients request that a respirator not be used We knew that once the situation became critical he could be kept alive for weeks for no real purpose at all said the patients brother AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an incurable disease that attacks the bodys immune system But there came a time when the patient knowing that his condition was terminal decided to try one last experimental drug If he were placed on a respirator his breathing would improve and he would have a better chance to respond to the drug But neither he nor his brother wanted to run the risk of having him remain on the respirator if the medication failed The doctor refused to place the patient on the respirator only temporarily You really lose control of the situation the brother said The legalities take over There has to be some way the control can be retaken and the fear taken out of doctors making decisions with families The hospital should be excused from liability The AIDS patient tried the medication without the respirator He died on June 14 The cost for his 20 days in the hospital was 18126 Countless Decisions Who better than a professional would know what to do when confronted with such dilemmas for a family member Who better than an intensive care unit nurse who has helped make countless decisions for others Beebe PalmaGil a nurse in the intensive care unit at Harlem Hospital thought she knew She works the night shift and on Thursday May 17 she left her son Rene as she usually did with the babysitter at 4 PM As usual Rene took a nap before dinner At about 6 PM the sitter discovered that Rene had stopped breathing Frantically the sitters husband administered mouth tomouth resuscitation and an ambulance was called Miss PalmaGil was summoned to the emergency room at St Lukes Do not do heroics she recalled telling the doctors on that Thursday the very first day The baby was unconscious and breathing by means of a respirator There were no indications of any brain function Changed Her Mind Miss PalmaGil moved into the intensive care unit and tended her son Gradually her feelings about his prognosis changed and by the following Tuesday she had changed her mind She wanted everything Mother has been talking to us all a social worker wrote about Miss PalmaGil in her notes of May 22 She is fully aware that the baby has a bad prognosis She has changed her original plan to have nothing done for the baby if parameters begin to fade Now she expresses that she wants all measures taken for support and complete CPR She is very much informed since she is a nurse herself Although Miss PalmaGils professional training told her that hope was futile her desire for aggressive care became increasingly adamant and unswerving I was still hoping for a miracle she said later I was talking to God If youre going to to do something show us now I thought of the Bible and Peter and how God made the baby

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PROPOSE WIDE RANGE OF POLICY GOALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/15/us/house-republicans-propose-wide-range-of-policy-goals.html,House Republican leaders today announced a policy agenda reflecting many of President Reagans goals including tax simplification broad spending cutbacks continued research into space based weapons production of the MX missile and aid to the rebels in Nicaragua The policy agenda which lists more than 250 proposals differs from the 1984 Republican platform in not including proposals to allow organized prayer in the schools or to ban abortion The proposals in the agenda announced by House Republican leaders at a news conference do not all have universal support among House Republicans and some goals that have support are not included Leaders acknowledged that many of the proposals would not be approved by Congress Some Internal Contradictions The agenda was designed to set overall goals and to appeal broadly to all 182 House Republicans and therefore had some internal contradictions It backs simplifying the nations tax system which would entail repeal of many popular tax credits and deductions But the agenda also proposes about a dozen new credits or deductions for such things as research and development job retraining hiring displaced homemakers and adopting children with special needs The head of the Republican panel that prepared the agenda Representative Jerry Lewis of California acknowledged there are contradictions If tax simplification is a goal he said then all kinds of credits dont fit But he argued that if tax simplification did not move ahead then the tax credit proposals will improve the use of the tax system The agenda also generally endorses most of the major weapons systems the Pentagon and the Reagan Administration want Some military experts argue that the major slowdown in the military buildup being contemplated on Capitol Hill would mean scrapping some weapons systems including the B1 bomber and the MX missile The agenda calls for broad savings in Federal programs including reduction in farm subsidies changes in military purchasing practices and many user fees But reducing the budget deficits was only one of many goals In fact passage of all the new initiatives would negate the savings proposed Not everybody is so possessed with this deficit that every document that is published has to have a bearing on deficitreduction said Representative Robert H Michel the minority leader The report did not address the question of savings in any automaticbenefit programs including Social Security Mr Michel indicated that he supported Mr Reagan in opposing a oneyear cancelation of the costofliving increase for Social Security as part of any deficitreducing package But Mr Michel said this would raise questions of equity if other benefit programs did not get such an increase Representative Jack F Kemp Republican of Upstate New York also voiced opposition to the elimination of the Social Security adjustment Mr Michel suggested that realism on the part of elected officials accounted for any differences between the agenda and the Republican platform Mr Lewis said proposals on abortion and school prayer were not included because he was looking for new ideas that havent hit the headlines
THE DANGERS OF DRAGGING RELIGION INTO THE PUBLIC AREA,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/16/opinion/l-the-dangers-of-dragging-religion-into-the-public-area-218081.html,To the Editor Rabbi Seymour Rosenbloom decries an ethical relativism that sees all values and life styles as equally valid and which he believes has led to moral drift and consequent socially undesirable behavior in American society letter Jan 1 Noting that religious leaders are proponents of particular styles of life informed by the precepts of their various religions he urges these leaders to make public judgments about appropriate ethical behavior and seek to influence the individual activity of our citizens No one would dispute a clergymans duty to instruct his followers However when a religious leader appoints himself as public arbiter of what is desirable behavior for those outside his flock whose actions do not conform to his particular religious beliefs he has taken a dangerous step toward totalitarian thinking Rabbi Rosenbloom seems to recognize the implicit threat in his proposal Why else must he reassure us that he is not arguing for repressive legislation that would roll back individual rights protected by law It should come as no surprise that such an assurance will generate far more skepticism than relief among those who are the targets of the public judgments of some potential self righteous religious figure whose claim to moral authority they do not concede or perhaps even respect The religious leader who enters the political fray will not find all the public predisposed to greet his efforts as just another welcome contribution to the general debate Rather most people will be correctly suspicious of any individual who claims to speak from a moral platform loftier than those the rest of us choose to occupy The pluralistic religious life of our nation is inherently divisive in many ways and as such it acts as a liberty preserving force Yet because this force is centrifugal mirroring our differences and acting to shield each sectarian group from encroachment by others religion is unlikely to serve as a constructive agent in achieving a moral consensus applicable to specific issues in the secular domain Thus both those who perform abortions and those who bomb abortion clinics to take one example will find religious leaders who support the morality of their actions Ironically religious controversy injected into our secular life may of necessity lead to the very ethical relativism to which Rabbi Rosenbloom objects In the meantime when religion is dragged into the public arena by its adherents it jeopardizes its own future as well as our freedom by encouraging intolerance polarization and extremism Citizens of our democracy are entrusted with sufficient secular tools to protect their personal liberty and advance their competing visions of a better society Religious leaders should respect this trust which is so carefully embodied in the constitutional separation of church and state Their sermons belong in the hearts of the faithful not on the 6 oclock news ETHAN TARASOV New York Jan 2 1985
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/17/garden/hers.html,The Hers column was designed as a forum for writing by women For the next several weeks it will be written by Barbara Ehrenreich author of The Hearts of Men American Dreams and the Flight From Commitment Anchor PressDoubleday 1983 ETHIOPIA reminds us that there are still people for whom food is primarily a means to biological survival Here to judge from the rapid conversion of real estate into takeout shops for gourmets and the sudden prominence of vegetables that begin with the letter A food has come to mean much more status authority entertainment style possibly religion Among the upscale trendsetting people who are held up for our admiration in commercials for credit cards and wine coolers food appears to be more fascinating than either sex or trivia games An evening on the town which used to mean dinner and a show now means a showy dinner followed perhaps by a chaste gelato In fact in anticipation of the time when food will have surpassed all other ingredients of high culture and when upward mobility will hinge on a mastery of puff pastry rather than a familiarity with computers or great books I am thinking of substituting food emporiums for museums on my childrens Sunday outings Already food has gained an equal footing with fashion and skin care in the mens magazines driven diet books to the remainder shelves and  as food history food criticism etc  gained a foothold in academia Those areas of artistic and intellectual endeavor that wish to survive may have to take up food themes or be content to make the same kind of accommodation to the restaurant that music has made to the piano bar As a longtime admirer of foods that outrank me in social status I am not complaining Thanks to the food fixation of the upwardly mobile pita bread and salad bars have sedimented down to Burger King suggesting that cold poached salmon may not be far behind And I will admit to having occasionally dined  on other peoples expense accounts  at establishments so tony that the dishes are reportedly rinsed in Perrier and the beef has graduated from stressfree organic grazing environments So it is without envy or ingratitude that I have been wondering why food Why food of all the obsessions  sex astrology real estate tropical bird breeding  available to those in the Gold Card bracket The first explanation I have come up with is a straightforward biological one Upscale people are fixated with food simply because they are now able to eat so much of it without getting fat and the reason they dont get fat is that they maintain a profligate level of calorie expenditure The very same people whose evenings begin with melted goat cheese and wind up hours later with raspberries cushioned on a lascivious cr eme a langlaise get up at dawn to run break for a midmorning aerobics class and watch the evening news while racing on a stationary bicycle This explanation assumes that past generations of dieters  the mothers and grandmothers of todays bigtime eaters  left a large proportion of our contemporaries genetically imprinted with a hunger of deep and savage proportions After having been teased for so long with grapefruit halves and celery sticks this vast hunger quite justifiably demands plates heaping with TexMex three course lunches and betweenmeal pasta primavera pickmeups Paradoxically of course the very occupations that pay well enough to finance gastronomic intake on such a scale  corporate law international banking cocaine retailing  involve almost zero energy expenditures in the course of a days work Hence the wild aerobic flailings and desperate fivemile runs required to maintain a fasttrack metabolism Exercise is the yuppie version of bulimia Not to push this theory too far you might say that exercise is to eating in the 80s as contraception was to sex in the 60s The pill IUDs and eventually legalized abortion freed sex from its ancient biological consequences and helped usher in the sexual revolution In the same way jogging jazzercize and Jane Fondas videotape have uncoupled gluttony from obesity and thus made possible what may someday be called the gastrointestinal revolution But hunger revived hourly by workouts and runs only explains why people eat not what they eat People who are merely hungry have been known to eat almost anything  bologna sandwiches bowls of millet unripe Brie Something larger than hunger sends young account executives rushing out of their condos after dark to pick up an extra bottle of walnut oil or raspberry vinegar And that can only be the drive to impress intimidate and inspire insecurity in ones dinner guests As a way of establishing ones own status or gauging anothers food has obvious advantages over our former cultural obsession sex A sexual encounter can only give you insight into your partners personal warmth generosity capacity for whimsy and so forth But a bout of competitive eating as it is now called gives you fairly precise information about your dining partners current and anticipated income social class or origin and probable taste in home furnishings Does your date think sushi is still stylish Then he has probably been passed over for a promotion and squeezed out when his apartment went coop If on the other hand he goes unhestitatingly for the baby bass en croute he may have a Harvard MBA and a flair for currency speculation just the kind of things that should in the world of culinary high rollers make you want to eat with him more often The fact that physical exercise  at least when performed with no thought of wages or other compensation and preferably at some expense to the exerciser  is itself a highstatus activity only heightens the necessity of conspicuous eating Whereas a decade or so ago the woman who ordered an abstemious chefs salad for lunch placed herself on a moral plane above her sister diners today she would only be suspected of sloth Clearly one would have to be a dancercize dropout or a marathon reject to get by on less than 2000 calories at midday In fact when has anyone last seen chefs salad on a menu of any importance Nor is it fashionable any longer to claim to require only coffee for breakfast friends would suspect you of failing to jog to work and wonder where you even got the strength to grind the beans Conversely of course anyone who makes a point of getting about town without running shoes risks being suspected of secret abstentions from bearnaise sauce and mousse No one stays on the fast track these days without developing the metabolic capacity of the shrew that tiny mammal that consumes three times its weight in food each day I hesitate to moralize about how this upscale metabolic speedup might look to a resident of a subSaharan refugee camp for I remember all too well how I responded as a child to any dinner table reference to children so unfortunate that they would feel blessed to encounter my plate of fried Spam and potatoes So wrap it up and send it to India then Yet our parents point sunk in we all know that there is a connection between waste in one location and simultaneous starvation in another between the gluttony of a few and the chronic hunger of the worlds many Perhaps if we could get our minds off the next meal and the caloric residue of the last one we might figure out what to do about it
POLL FAVORS KOCH FOR 3D TERM BUT CITY SERVICES RATE POORLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/17/nyregion/poll-favors-koch-for-3d-term-but-city-services-rate-poorly.html,A majority of New York Citys residents believe that Mayor Koch deserves to be reelected to a third term according to a New York Times poll At the same time many residents say the city is doing a poor job of delivering some major services although few hold the Mayor directly accountable When those surveyed in the poll were asked separately for their opinions of a number of public officials the Mayor was rated favorably by twothirds of the respondents  well above the rating received by any of his leading potential challengers The Mayors standing was unusually high for any elected official who has been in such a visible administrative government position for seven years and he ranked about as well as he did in a Times poll soon after he was returned to office in a landslide victory in 1981 Other Officials Rated Among the other officials two of Mr Kochs potential challengers  City Council President Carol Bellamy and Herman Badillo a former Bronx Borough President Congressman and Deputy Mayor  were viewed favorably by 38 percent and 34 percent respectively of the 1329 New York City residents whom The Times polled by telephone from Jan 5 to 10 The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points Governor Cuomo now midway through his first term was rated favorably by 58 percent and unfavorably by 10 percent The profile of Mr Koch that emerges suggests a rare political breed a Democrat who is especially popular among Republicans and the rich and a mayor whose popularity like President Reagans transcends the publics individual complaints about his government Blacks the jobless and the poor were the only groups that opposed his reelection The Mayors popularity is striking because while the poll found that fewer respondents were as pessimistic about New York Citys future as those surveyed three years ago many of them still said they were dissatisfied with city services But most did not hold Mr Koch directly accountable Nearly four out of five said he was only somewhat or not at all responsible for what was wrong with the city with most of those expressing the opinion that the problems were beyond his control or the control of any one person Mayor Koch is just the Mayor said Alfonso Etheredge of Queens a 27 yearold shipping clerk who was randomly selected in the poll and made comments in a followup interview He can only do so much and whether he can do more depends on whether other people will give him a hand To be honest said a woman from Greenwich Village I dont know exactly what he is responsible for doing as mayor But its hard for me to believe that in a city as big as New York that one person should be responsible for everything Other responses to the poll however hinted at Mr Kochs political vulnerabilities as he prepares to formally start his reelection campaign When pressed nearly one in four of those who had described Mr Koch as somewhat or not at all responsible for the things that they disliked about the city said the Mayor could do more and had not been responsible enough Although many people absolved Mr Koch of responsibility for problems that appeared to be intractable 72 percent said the city could do more about homeless people compared with 19 percent who said the problem was beyond the citys control While more of the blacks surveyed viewed him more favorably than not blacks said by nearly 2 to 1 that it was time to give someone else a chance to be the Mayor Mr Kochs contentious relationship with many black leaders may also represent a potential political liability Over all 52 percent of the New Yorkers polled said the city was paying too little attention to the needs of blacks and other minority groups Among whites 38 percent agreed  up from 29 percent who said so in the 1981 poll Only a third of all those polled said the city was being run for the benefit of all the people A little more than half said it was being run by a few big interests looking out for themselves Support for Another Term Mr Kochs margin of support for another term was swollen by his appeal to Republicans 60 percent of whom said he deserved to be reelected with 31 percent saying they preferred a fresh face The rest were undecided Among Democrats alone the Mayor was viewed as deserving another term by a narrower margin of 52 percent to 40 percent In 1981 the Mayor won renomination in the Democratic primary by 60 percent to 36 percent The poll found evidence of a gender gap in Mr Kochs popularity  fewer women than men said he deserved a third term A week before Mr Koch was inaugurated as the Mayor in 1978 54 percent of the people surveyed by a New York TimesChannel 2 poll had a favorable impression of him and 15 percent viewed him unfavorably How He Handles His Job In the 1981 Times survey 71 percent of those responding said they approved of the way Mr Koch was handling his job and 22 percent disapproved The percentage of respondents who rated Mr Koch favorably in the latest poll  66 percent  far surpassed the ratings received by any potential opponents who were included in the survey Nineteen percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of the Mayor and 11 percent said they were undecided Only 3 percent said they had not heard enough about Mr Koch to form an opinion In the 1985 poll 53 percent said Mr Koch has performed his job as Mayor well enough to deserve reelection and 37 percent said that they thought it was time to give a new person a chance to do better The question is one that is often posed about incumbents when there is no clearly defined opponent Interviewers asked Do you think that Ed Koch has performed his job as Mayor well enough to deserve reelection or do you think its time to give a new person a chance to do better Mr Koch scored best among whites  65 percent of whom said he deserved reelection while 26 percent said he did not Blacks divided 31 percent in support of the Mayor to 59 percent who prefer someone else Hispanic respondents leaned toward his reelection  49 percent to 41 percent People who identified themselves as liberals split evenly But those who described themselves as moderates or conservatives said by nearly 2 to 1 that the Mayor deseved a third term Mr Koch first campaigned for Mayor as a political outsider and he appears to have largely succeeded in shielding himself from criticism of the city governments performance In addition he seems to have benefited from two shifts in popular perception a lowering of expectations since the citys fiscal crisis a decade ago about what the city government is capable of accomplishing and a decline in the percentage of New Yorkers who take a dim view of the citys future Among those who predicted that New York would be a better place to live in 10 or 15 years 59 percent said Mr Koch deserved another term and 31 percent said it was time to try somebody else Those who forecast that the future would be worse nonetheless favored his reelection but by a slimmer margin 52 percent to 41 percent What They Like Best Regardless of their overall opinion of the Mayor what most people said they liked best about him was that he was frank outspoken witty and funny What most said they liked least was that he was frank outspoken arrogant too theatrical and a loudmouth According to the poll Mr Kochs bluntness is what is liked both best and least by 8 percent of the public Nonetheless that group favored him by 75 percent to 16 percent The experience of New Yorkers with the city bureaucracy appeared to have had little effect on their perception of the Mayor himself Mr Koch has said repeatedly that he spent his first term restoring the citys fiscal stability and when he declared his candidacy for reelection in 1981 announced that today the delivery of services moves into first place The Times poll found that as Mr Koch begins the final year of his second term most people believe the city is doing a good job providing only one service  firefighting Of the seven other services listed in the survey  some of which are not the Mayors direct responsibility  two or more are being performed poorly according to fourfifths of those polled Twofifths thought four or more were done poorly Asked to choose among four alternatives half the people polled said crime was the worst problem facing the city The other alternatives were housing public transportation and public schools The Mayor is not empowered to exert direct control over the transportation and school systems In contrast 50 percent or more said the city was doing a poor job providing subway and bus service repairing the streets caring for the homeless and enforcing housing regulations Of those who said they had actually complained to someone in city government about a particular problem in their neighborhood 40 percent said they were satisfied with the response and 56 percent were not Blame for transit problems was laid at the door of the MTA a statedominated agency by a third of those polled Half as many said the Mayor and the city government were responsible Who Is Responsible At the end of the telephone interviews New Yorkers were asked whether Mr Koch was responsible for the things they had mentioned that were wrong with the city Only 13 percent replied that he was very responsible 60 percent said he was somewhat responsible and 19 percent said he was not responsible at all A quarter of the respondents said they did not know enough about Miss Bellamy the City Council President But of those who did 38 percent said they thought favorably of her 16 percent had an unfavorable view and 19 percent were undecided Despite a lukewarm response from several black leaders Miss Bellamy was viewed more favorably by blacks than by either whites or Hispanic respondents She scored equally well with men and women Mr Badillo was rated favorably by 34 percent of the respondents and unfavorably by 10 percent Mr Badillo who was born in Puerto Rico was viewed most favorably by Hispanic respondents  45 percent  compared with 31 percent of the whites who expressed an opinion and 33 percent of the blacks Other possible mayoral candidates about whom opinions were sought in the poll included City Comptroller Harrison J Goldin Victor Gotbaum the municipal labor leader and Frank J Barbaro the Brooklyn Assemblyman who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Koch in the 1981 Democratic primary When questioned about other potential candidates three out of four people polled said they did not know enough to express an opinion about Albert Vann the Brooklyn Assemblyman who has emerged as a leading black politician and Stanley Fink the Assembly Speaker from Brooklyn who said earlier this week that he would not be a candidate for mayor this year The poll also measured the publics impressions of Archbishop John J OConnor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York who has clashed publicly with Governor Cuomo and other Catholic politicians including former Representative Geraldine A Ferraro of Queens who was the Democratic VicePresidential candidate over the issue of abortion rights The Archbishop has also clashed with Mr Koch over a city contract clause barring discrimination against homosexuals Most Roman Catholics had pretty much the same opinions about Archbishop OConnor and Mr Cuomo according to the poll Mr Cuomo was viewed favorably by 51 percent of white and Hispanic Catholics while 14 percent had an unfavorable opinion of the Governor He fared better among all other groups 64 percent to 8 percent Among white and Hispanic Catholics the Archbishop was viewed favorably by 55 percent and unfavorably by 13 percent But he was not perceived as well among all other groups 35 percent of whom had a favorable opinion of him and 22 percent of whom did not Over all Archbishop OConnor received a favorable rating from 43 percent of all city residents and an unfavorable one from 18 percent Mr Cuomo was viewed favorably by 58 percent and unfavorably by 10 percent Highest Unfavorable Response Mrs Ferraro who is considered a potential candidate for United States Senator in 1986 generated the highest unfavorable response of any public figure whose popularity was measured by the poll Her husband John A Zaccaro pleaded guilty on Jan 7 to an indictment charging him with scheming to fraudulently obtain financing for a realestate deal Politicians have differed about whether those charges would do lasting damage to her political career One in four of those surveyed said they had an unfavorable opinion of Mrs Ferraro and 41 percent  39 percent of the men and 43 percent of the women polled  expressed a favorable view of her Edward I Koch Carol Bellamy Herman Badillo Harrison J Goldin Victor Gotbaum Frank J Barbaro

4 Indicted in Attacks On Abortion Facilities,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/17/us/4-indicted-in-attacks-on-abortion-facilities.html,A Federal grand jury today indicted four people in the Dec 25 bombings of three abortion clinics Two of the defendants also were indicted for a similar bombing last June Matthew J Goldsby and James T Simmons both 21 years old of Cantonment Fla were each charged on nine counts concerning the four bombings one of conspiracy four of constructing explosive devices and four of using those devices to blow up buildings Mr Goldsbys fiancee Kaye Wiggins 18 of Pensacola Fla and Mr Simmons wife Kathren also 18 each were indicted on seven counts concerning the three bombings Dec 25 The 23member grand jury presented the indictments to Federal Magistrate Robert Crongeyer after meeting for more than 10 hours today and part of Tuesday Arraignment and trial dates have not yet been determined The two men have said in interviews that they bombed all four buildings to save the lives of unborn childen They said the same thing to Federal agents
BOMBING CASE OFFERS A STARK LOOK AT ABORTION CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/18/us/bombing-case-offers-a-stark-look-at-abortion-clinics.html,They called themselves knights their emblem was a mask they had printed on Tshirts bearing the motto Protectors of the Code and their mission was to defend the ideals of chivalry The shirts were part of a secret game a fantasy spun by two former Bible school chums to combat the dark forces of the world By their own admission Matthew J Goldsby and James T Simmons both 21 years old had sat at a kitchen table and spooned explosive black powder into large iron pipes that were planted to explode before daybreak on Christmas at three buildings where abortions were performed Mr Goldsby also took responsibility for a bombing last June at one of the same sites The destruction of the buildings was not part of a game nor was it instigated by some conspiratoral cult said the two young men They were they said doing Gods work God My Country My Family After their arrests two weeks ago Mr Goldsby a construction worker said that God had directed him to put the abortion facilities out of business Mr Simmons a glass cutter by trade said his motivation was love for God my country my family  thats about it Their case and the determination of the defendants to try to explain their behavior has stirred passions in the Pensacola area and has provided insight into the attitudes of some people caught up in the deepening controversy over abortion It has also inspired vigorous debate from those who say the young men were overly influenced by religious appeals from experts who see the case as symptomatic of unrest over social changes that continue to disturb working class whites in the Deep South from those who say they were decent young men acting on conscience to correct a great moral wrong A Federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted Mr Goldsby and Mr Simmons on nine counts each in the bombings of three offices Dec 25 and one last June The Associated Press reported They were each charged with one count of conspiracy four of constructing explosive devices and four of using those devices to blow up buildings Mr Goldsbys fiancee Kaye Wiggins 18 of Pensacola Fla and Mr Simmons wife Kathren also 18 were each indicted on seven counts in connection with the three bombings Dec 25 Arraignment was scheduled for Friday If convicted of all charges the men could receive a maximum of 90 years in prison and 90000 in fines The women could be sentenced to a maximum of 70 years and fined up to 70000 upon conviction Mr Goldsby was arrested Dec 30 after investigators traced purchases of explosives and Mr Simmons turned himself in Jan 1 Kathy Simmons and Kaye Wiggins were later charged as accessories to the Dec 25 bombings No one was injured in the attacks but estimates put the damage at 500000 in damage The men both of Cantonment a rural town 10 miles from Pensacola have been denied bail but the women are free without bond Agents See No Connection Federal officials who made the arrests said they could find no evidence to connect the suspects with attacks on abortion centers in other states Moreover agents said there was no reason to suspect a wider conspiracy in the 30 bombings or arson at abortion clinics in eight states and the District of Columbia over the past two and a half years The arrests here were made by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms of the Treasury Department Mr Goldsby in a recent meeting with reporters at the Escambia County jail where both men are being held scoffed at the suggestion of a national conspiracy This is Spanky and Alfalfa right here Mr Goldsby said appearing to endorse a sentiment others here voiced that their gang was no more dangerous than the kids in the Our Gang film comedies He said 12 Tshirts emblazoned with the mask and the words Protectors of the Code that the police had found were simply part of a private game he and Mr Simmons shared Mr Goldsby said they had the shirts made at a shop as part of their boyhood fantasy Just the Two of Us Theres no gang theres no leader and theres no conspiracy he said in the interview Its just the two of us Its always been just the two of us Few people in the western end of the Florida Panhandle which is closer to Houston than it is to Miami openly condoned the bombings But neither was there an outpouring of condemnation A few people including John Burt the most outspoken of the antiabortion leaders in Pensacola seemed to be filled with admiration for the two men Maybe like Harpers Ferry where John Brown used violence to bring the evils of slavery into focus these bombings may do the same thing on the abortion issue said Mr Burt who last year led picketing against a number of clinics including some that were later bombed He operates Our Fathers House a home for pregnant and homeless women When the history of this period is written it wont be the pickets or the letterwriters who will be the heroes he said Its going to be the bombers A Region in Transition The Deep South the most distinctive region in the United States only a generation ago has undergone broad social political and economic changes within the past quartercentury and a resurgence of interest in fundamentalist religions is interpreted by many as a reaction to a perceived threat against traditional values and abortion is the issue that has aroused the strongest emotions some experts say Dr James R McGovern author of a book on Pensacola in which he describes its social and economic tensions said it was not surprising to find confusion in peoples minds if religious leaders citing scripture challenged the faithful to be militant in the defense of defenseless fetuses Dr McGovern chairman of the history department at the University of West Florida said in an interview that in the Florida Panhandle like much of the South resistence to change even by breaking laws was seen not only as morally correct and imperative but also as heroic Because of the regions history he added it is likely this combination holds a special even hypnotic appeal to some individuals Usually their targets are perceived to be morally indefensible he continued Almost always they are convinced that if all good people could speak their heart their view would be in the majority Reflection on Citys Image One indirect casualty of the bombings is the reputation of Pensacola where many residents fear that national publicity on the bombings will cast it as a backwater of religious zealotry Pensacola has prided itself on a history of social diversity The city a thriving port at the turn of the century has depended for 70 years on the Naval Air Station that trains pilots for the Navy Marines and Coast Guard Civilian payrolls at the Navy base and the development of tourism brought a measure of prosperity to the region And life began to improve for dispossessed tenant farmers from south Alabama who had been drawn here to work But prosperity also brought more pressures for social change and radio and television evangelists railed against outside influences that they said threatened family values In time experts say these emotions were galvanized by the antiabortion cause Era of Legalized Abortion The first legal abortion clinic here the Ladies Center a nonprofit counseling service opened in Pensacola in 1974 one year after the United States Supreme Court struck down laws banning abortions Initially there was little outright opposition here But in recent years as private physicians entered the market and as Pensacola became a center for abortions in West Florida an outcry was heard from pulpits In 1980 2808 abortions were reported in the county which had 4622 live births Picketing of the Ladies Center and other clinics increased last year Ministers and followers tried to talk women out of entering these places There was some vandalism like squirting glue into locks In June the first bomb went off destroying the Ladies Center Picket organizers expressed disapproval but some said it was inevitable Were in a sort of war the Rev David Shofner pastor of West Pensacola Baptist Church would explain later In a war you have opposing sides each side thinking theyre right And always in a war you have casualties Who is dying The unborn babies I Dont Care Was Response When Mr Burt of Our Fathers House was asked after his group resumed picketing later in the summer whether he considered that such activity might encourage another bombing he told a reporter for The Pensacola News Journal I dont care Linda Taggert director of the Ladies Center which on Dec 25 was bombed again said in an interview There is so much misinformation about what goes on in these clinics that its no wonder the minds of some young people are polluted by their elders Early Dec 25 the second bomb exploded at the Ladies Center which had moved into new offices Minutes later bombs destroyed the offices of Dr William Permenter and Dr Bo Bagenholm physicians who do therapeutic abortions as a small part of gynecological practice The way Kaye Wiggins Mr Goldsbys fiancee recalls events it was not until a week before Christmas that she learned of plans to blow up the offices She later said at news conference arranged by her attorney that Mr Goldsby and Mr Simmons were constructing the bombs in Mr Goldsbys kitchen but she said she could not bring herself to watch them and had been surprised that they knew how to build a bomb I never knew they had this kind of knowledge she said To me theyre just kids Theyre just like me The Dec 25 bombings shook up people in the community including staunch antiabortionists who thought it was inappropriate to bomb on Christmas morning But Miss Wiggins said she saw the attacks as a gift to Jesus on his birthday The bombings brought the Federal agents into the city and a check was made of recent sales of black powder by supply firms Mr Goldsby was arrested within days at his home in Cantonment and the three others surrendered shortly after Paul Shimek Jr an attorney for the four defendants hinted that he might attempt to make abortion and not the bombings the issue in the case The attorney also has let the defendants talk with reporters about the bombings Attorney Applauds Candor A decade ago Mr Shimek a former Navy flier was an attorney for pornography interests and helped get the movie Deep Throat shown locally Mr Shimek who describes himself as a bornagain Christian applauded his clients zeal for confessing their acts All the cards have been placed on the table he said There are no secrets and thats just the way good Christians behave James Simmons is tall lanky and good at working with his hands At a news conference he let Mr Goldsby do most of the talking I dont have the gift of words that Matt does he drawled He described himself as a hound dog  common and loyal valued traits in this region When a reporter mentioned that the Federal investigators had remarked that the wiring of the bombs looked almost professional Mr Simmons beamed Mr Simmonss family acknowledges that the young man did not complete boot training after enlisting in the Marine Corps but he and his family have refused to give the reasons He had entered the Marines after the death in 1982 of his father a police officer Praise From an Employer Matt Goldsby is the kind of man said Steven DelGallo the owner of the construction company that employed him who had the potential to do anything he wanted to do Miss Wiggins thought so too Matt was my knight in shining armor she said Mr Goldsbys parents were divorced when he was a child and his grandparents helped rear him and brought him up in church the First Assembly of God in Pensacola where they were longtime members The Rev Lindall Ballenger who has been pastor of the church for several months said he had come to know Mr Goldsby He and Jimmy were inseparable the minister said They were probably in the same youth group in the church since they were young fellows Matt was the dominant figure he said always egging Jimmy into some adventure even as they grew older Like one time they took this daring trip down a river on a log raft just for the challenge of it he said Pastor Does Not Condone Acts As for the bombs the pastor said Its easy to say God made me do it but thats a copout in my opinion Im not saying God cant talk to people he added but God doesnt tell people to go out and bomb abortion clinics Like it or not abortion is legal and blowing up a building is not the pastor said Our weapons are not bombs All that does is take the issue away from us The odd thing he said is that neither of the two men appeared to be active in the abortion controversy Matter of fact Matts mother did some picketing and he got on her about that Mr Ballenger said He seemed upset about her doing that Linda Taggert who has lived in Pensacola 21 years sings in the Presbyterian Church choir and has a 17yearold daughter said They picked me as a target because Im a woman and they think they can harass and intimidate a woman into giving up Well they picked the wrong woman Two young men are going to spend most of their adult lives in prison she said while the people who put them up to it are free to drop their poison in some other young mind Philosophy of Nonviolence When asked what advice he would give others who wanted to combat abortion Mr Burt said he would tell them to act in a nonviolent way the way Martin Luther King did Twenty years ago Mr Burt who is 43 years old was active in the Ku Klux Klan in St Augustine Fla he said and was in the center of violent protests against the integration efforts by some followers of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr I was a very bigoted young man he said I was convinced that integration was a Communist conspiracy to take over the USA Mr Burt said his views changed after he served a jail term on grand larceny charges and met Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior He said he believes more clinic bombings are inevitable Asked if he felt responsible in any way for the bombings he said I cant be responsible for everyone Its like blaming the President for deaths in a war just because hes Commander in Chief
BRIEFING;   Here Come the Judges,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/18/us/briefing-here-come-the-judges.html,President Reagan is almost sure to appoint more men and women to the Federal bench than any other President ever has Jimmy Carter holds the record with 262 But Mr Reagan reached 167 in his first term and more than 100 district court and Court of Appeals seats are currently vacant in many cases because of Congressional expansion of judicial bankruptcy machinery In addition deaths and retirements will create more available judgeships before the end of Mr Reagans second term in 1988 In anticipation of this several liberal legal groups have formed a watchdog organization the Alliance for Justice that plans to monitor all appointments According to Nan Aron executive director the group will try to promote the selection of judges who are independent nonpartisan and believe in equal justice and fairness She said the group was concerned that the 1984 Republican platform might limit the President to selecting judges who oppose abortion or promise to exercise judicial restraint The alliance will work with state and local bar groups and citizens organizations and provide background on prospective nominees to both the American Bar Association and the Senate Judiciary Committee which confirms or rejects all candidates Among the twodozen organizations sponsoring the alliance are the Womens Legal Defense Fund the NOW Legal Defense Fund the Environmental Defense Fund the Mental Health Law Project and the Center for Law and Social Policy

TIME AND HER SISTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/books/time-and-her-sisters.html,SOLSTICE By Joyce Carol Oates 243 pp New York E P Dutton 1595 The soft underbelly of feminist thought has promoted the idea that if women ruled the world cooperation supportiveness even love would replace patriarchal imperatives like competition dominance and brute force The rationale for this hope lies in the shaky theory that women somehow work and play together better than men  a seductive hypothesis that ought to be put to the test One of the best ways to test ideas is in fiction of course But where is the literature of womens relationships The tradition is in its infancy with such benchmarks as The Group by Mary McCarthy The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing and The Company of Women by Mary Gordon appearing over the past three decades Suddenly last year novelists of both sexes turned to the subject of women friends Alice Adams Doris Grumbach and John Updike weighed in in 1984 This year is off to a fast start with Gail Godwins novel on the subject coming later this month and now Joyce Carol Oatess Solstice  a disturbing and unsparing story of the friendship of two unforgettable women Those looking for a cozy rendition of sisterly love wont find it here In Solstice Miss Oates returns from the 19th century where she has spent her past few novels to tell the contemporary story of Monica Jensen a young woman running away from her past and Sheila Trask a slightly older woman paralyzed at the thought of the future  two people whose trajectories intersect at a crucial moment in their lives and who enter an obsessive and destructive romance No other word will do though both women are determinedly heterosexual and disturbed by the feelings they provoke in one another Monica Jensen is a golden girl a happy pretty Middle Westerner transplanted to the East Coast blessed by natural good looks and the luck to match them or so she has been able to convince everyone including herself When we meet her Monica has just arrived to teach at Glenkill Academy a Quaker boarding school for boys in Bucks County Pa She has just ended a disastrous eightyear marriage that has left her with a small scar on her face and bad memories of an abortion she is determined to start over bury her past What shes gone through is no big deal she reasons She denigrates the experience on the grounds that it belonged to too many people of her generation Indeed she is beginning to feel blessed in her new surroundings Poor Monica In Miss Oatess hell there is an especially hot place reserved for those who believe they can walk away from their experiences unscathed and Monica will learn the hard way what happens to one who cannot remember her past Sheila Trasks background is equally clouded Recently widowed she appears first in the guise of the tall handsome stranger of classic romance  a mysterious presence much speculated on among the Glenkill faculty and merchants in the nearby town Sheila is a minor if serious artist who was overshadowed by her husband the late Morton Flaxman a sculptor of international reputation Among the locals there are whispers about Sheila The goingson up at Edgemont the TraskFlaxman estate are rumored to have included wild parties careless sexual arrangements and even a drunken latenight shooting But Sheila appears to care little about her past and less about what people think of her Shes aloof arrogant a kind of natural aristocrat After meeting at the headmasters cocktail party Sheila and Monica strike up a curious and improbable friendship Sheila begins dropping by on horseback at the cottage Monica has rented and is obsessively restoring Monica starts driving over to the carriagehouse Rebecca Pepper Sinkler is deputy editor of The Book Review studio where Sheila is  equally obsessively  painting The two women are as different as sun and moon  Sheila darkhaired swarthy elusive mannish in her paintspattered clothes smelling always of stables sweat turpentine and Monica fair diffident fastidious one of Miss Oatess fine subtle touches is almost never to associate Monica with any natural odor of her own the embodiment of girlish innocence like something out of a feminine hygiene commercial Sunny Monica and stormy Sheila start spending hours together working drinking red wine late into the night But the two though opposites are not equals and one of the novels main focuses is the degree of control each woman exercises as the relationship goes through its complex cycles At first Monica is the weaker unsure of herself hungry for the approval of her older more sophisticated richer friend Little by little she surrenders her judgment and her private life to Sheilas not veryloving care Sheila persuades the younger woman to join her cruising the local bars incognito picking up locals  truck drivers and auto mechanics The sexual preening here is as much for each other as for the men and Sheila comes off as a monstrous snob borderline schizophrenic and manhater One dark night on a lonely road the two women almost get raped by a couple of randy drunks Just as one is beginning to see Monica as the alltime patsy repeating the victims role she played in her marriage Miss Oates subtly tips the scales In one of her most brilliant delineations of character in crisis she leads Sheila into a terrifying psychic impasse First she afflicts the woman with a massive painters block As the winter solstice approaches when day and night themselves shift their balance Sheila slides toward depression An impending deadline for a onewoman show in Manhattan brings on an acute awareness of time and of its sisters age and death Sheila is supposed to be completing a series of paintings called Ariadnes Thread In her descent into the labyrinth of her mind she cuts the lifeline that might lead her back out Mortality Always and forever mortality Nothing else engages me nothing else terrifies me but I cant seem to translate it into work my mind is spinning its going around in circles and I cant get off Accompanying her artistic paralysis is a monumental case of selfpity that takes itself out on Monica In the face of her mortality terrified that she has become dependent on her friend Sheila tries to destroy the very thing that might save her  Monicas fierce loyalty and love Its a classic neurotics game that ends inevitably in the ultimate psychological blackmail a suicide threat Suicide requires magnanimity of spirit dont you think Sheila taunts her devastated friend But why does Monica sit still for this one wonders Joyce Carol Oates has given us some of the most willing victims in contemporary literature When it comes to appreciating the masterslave game she can rival Franz Kafka and is often as blackly funny And Monica Jensen is one of Miss Oatess most believable professional victims For half the book she walks around with a giant psychic kickme sign taped to her back Its what happens in the second half of the book that redeems the friendship and the suffering of both women When Sheila on the brink of madness bolts Glenkill for sunshine and oblivion in Morocco the griefstricken Monica begins to put her psychic house in order She returns to visit her parents in Wrightsville Ind draws closer to the school community and her students confronts her memories of her abortion and scarring marriage and thinks through her halfhearted relationship with Keith a man she has been dating throughout the book A minor character etched with malicious glee by Miss Oates Keith is a member of the survivalist movement and is researching where to head after a nuclear attack It wont be an amateurs world postholocaust he assures Monica WHETHER Monica will survive the disaster that awaits her when Sheila comes back to Glenkill remains a question until the last page of the book By the end the two women have undergone the journey to selfknowledge that is the heros traditional work The voyage is not for the faint of heart and neither is this book written in Miss Oatess highly colored but firmly controlled prose The problem Miss Oates has set herself is to keep us reading as Monica and Sheila approach and withdraw in what might in lesser hands become monotonous cycles After all we are conditioned to see womens struggles in relation to men as dramatic in relation to other women as banal  even repellent Images come to mind in descending order  bickering in the Ladies Auxiliary catfights mudwrestling Miss Oates makes us take Monica and Sheilas lovehate bond seriously by creating two believable complicated women and by grounding her story in the universal The dying of the light at winters solstice that deepens Sheilas despair was the source of rituals and myths by which ancient men and women reconciled the terrors of nature with reason and hope Whether one reads Solstice with The Golden Bough and Joseph Campbell as guides or just for its story of two difficult women orbiting in obsession doesnt really matter It taps deeply into our experience Almost a halfcentury ago Virginia Woolf called for a new kind of fiction one in which women would be described not only in relation to the other sex She predicted that when a woman finally wrote a novel in which two women are represented as friends she would light a torch in that vast chamber where nobody has yet been Joyce Carol Oates never squeamish about looking into the dark places of the soul has aimed a powerful beam into that shadowy chamber Solstice should dispel a lot of comforting ideas about the nature of womenB The MirrorGhoul Awaits She spoke of getting older always older The clock she said ran in one direction only that was its subtle trick Her eyes were black blackly moist and the veins showed faintly blue at her temples how strange she has become Monica thought staring how beautiful She began to speak of her mothers death  and then stopped And Monica did not dare take her up on the subject knowing from past experience that Sheila could not be interrogated    She too was terrified of it the mirrorghoul Sheila said raising her glass in a mock toast  I dont know who that woman is shed tell us  I dont know who that thing is and Im not going to look again But she knew she knew Monica licked her lips and said softly that she was sorry Sorry Why Sheila said irritably The mirrorghoul is waiting for you too  even if you are a golden girl  From Solstice
"PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;

A SHOW THAT REVEALS AN ARTIST AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/arts/photography-view-a-show-that-reveals-an-artist-at-the-height-of-his.html,Duane Michalss current exhibition of mostly recent work has things in it that are as strong and moving as anything he has ever done But it is in parts a very angry show attacking the President of the United States and some of his supporters in ways that are bound to give offense even to some who may in a general way share Michalss views  If this is an odd thing to say about an art photography exhibition it is because Michals has developed techniques for expressing his ideas that most art photographers do not use and in his current exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery 110 West 57th Street through Feb 2 he has gone further than ever before in saying exactly what he means  As a museum and gallery photographer he is also a fashion and portrait photographer for magazines Michals made his name 15 years ago with small sequences of blackandwhite photographs in which strange little stories were told These stories seemed as impersonal and objective as a news report for though they were obviously staged and to that degree a creation of Michalss imagination they dealt with a variety of different characters and situations few of which suggested autobiography The present exhibition demonstrates that Michals is still able to create such narrative sequences There are three of them one done in 1978 one in 1980 and one in 1982 and the most recent one a siximage sequence entitled Christ in New York is as good as any he has ever done The basic idea that Christ would not be recognized if He returned to earth today has a long history in modern literature But Michalss visualization of a contemporary Christ is the most convincing one that I know of whether in still photography the movies or painting and there can scarcely be a more difficult subject to depict convincingly  Michals never produced more than a few such sequences a year for though each was deceptively simple  no elaborate sets or costumes just ordinarylooking people in ordinarylooking rooms or city streets  each was the visualization of a good idea and good ideas are few and far between especially good ideas that can be expressed in pictures Perhaps this is why Michals began to add texts to some of his pictures at first to individual pictures then to some sequences Words gave him a means of dealing with themes that resisted visualization  Words also released in him a lyric poet that is every bit as good as the narrative poet of the pictorial sequences A love poem like the one in the present show that begins with the words Wounded and in disarray can stand with the foremost lyrics of our time At the same time he began to use explicitly autobiographical elements  in the pictures He began to appear in his own photographs as an old man bald sagging despairing or even dead One of his most moving texts was a letter to his dead father lamenting the gulf that had separated them in life One of his most affecting selfportraits showed him as an old artist with a young model who could be understood as his own youth now gone or as the son he had wanted but never had or as a longedfor lover who could never be won or perhaps as all three at once  In his earlier narrative sequences Michals celebrated youth and beauty both masculine and feminine but as his work became more lyric and introspective the masculine came to predominate most notably in a series of photographic meditations on themes suggested by the love poems of C P Cavafy Handsome young men nude or seminude increasingly came to stand for life love hope  for everything that seems increasingly desirable and increasingly hard to attain as dread despair and the fear of death fill the soul   In the present exhibition the love of such young men is not only celebrated it is presented in opposition to the forces of organized religion and politics that are as Michals sees it the chief enemies of life love and hope One of the most moving and beautiful texts mourns the recent deaths of American Marines in Beirut while putting the blame for their deaths not on Arab terrorists but on President Reagan One of the pictures most likely to cause offense is entitled Vote Reagan and shows a smiling priest aiming a crucifix like a pistol at the head of a young man blindfolded by an American flag  Michalss animus against positions taken by the Reagan Administration and some of its religious supporters is summed up in the sequence Christ in New York The Christ figure in this series is played by a bearded man wearing a workshirt and jeans The man is neither handsome nor plain neither young nor old He is heavyset of medium height and somewhat withdrawn in expression with a glow of light behind his head In the first photograph he suffers silently as a smarmylooking middle aged evangelist rants and raves on TV In the second he weeps at the sight of a young woman killed by an illegal abortion In the third he defends a homosexual man against an attack by bullies In the fourth he eats dog food with an old woman in Brooklyn In the fifth he sees a young man sexually attack a young woman In the last he is killed by a mugger with a handgun The running text concludes the second coming has occurred and no one noticed It is not necessary to share all the sentiments expressed in these pictures and texts to recognize the power with which they are expressed Even at their most contentious these combinations of words and pictures are the work of a true artist at the height of his powers And it will be perhaps a little anticlimactic to mention one development in Duane Michalss art that does not seem to me to be successful as yet That is his practice of painting on photographs His painting is neater now than it was several years ago but most of the pictures where he uses paint are comparatively trivial even jokey  for example Primavera a takeoff on the painting by Botticelli in which brightly colored painted flowers stream from the open mouth of a young man Even Vote Reagan where the American flag blindfold is painted red white and blue works just as well if not better in black and white
POLITICS;   VOTE FRAUD CASE: UNUSUAL ELEMENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/nyregion/politics-vote-fraud-case-unusual-elements.html,a prosecution conviction and jail term in an election fraud trial  had other unusual elements that added up to a bizarre Nassau County case John Cain a Right to Life activist is serving a 58day term in the Nassau County jail for his conviction on election fraud charges He was sentenced 10 days ago by County Judge Raymond Harrington who said he had similar views on the abortion issue Mr Cain was prosecuted by the office of District Attorney Denis Dillon one of the few high public officials who flatly oppose legalized abortion Mr Dillon goes further than most highranking Catholic politicians who maintain that they personally oppose abortion but as public officials say they cannot impose their views on others Mr Cain was convicted of filing designating petitions for a Republican nomination for the State Senate in 1980 that included names of enrolled Republicans signed by other people in the same household when the law requires that each petitioner must sign his or her own name Mr Cain was also charged with perjury but a jury failed to reach a decision on that more serious charge and Mr Dillon decided not to press for a second trial on that charge Such election fraud allegations are not uncommon particularly in primary election campaigns when the Democratic or Republican regular organizations carefully scrutinize the petitions of insurgents looking for mistakes or fraud In many cases insurgents like Mr Cain are removed from the ballot by the major party controlled Board of Elections and they accept that decision Or if they do appeal the Board of Elections decision to the courts they avoid testifying and putting themselves in the path of possible perjury charges This case was different because of Mr Cain and Mr Dillon even though they agree on the abortion issue which was Mr Cains prime rationale for challenging the renomination of State Senator Ralph J Marino in the 1980 Republican primary Mr Cain a Bethpage resident and a New York City teacher insisted on fighting his removal from the ballot into the courts and onto the witness stand attesting to the validity of petitions he personally had collected Thirtythree signatures were invalidated on grounds of fraud but he was prosecuted for five of them Mr Dillon in turn had warned party leaders that unlike other prosecutors who consider election fraud cases as political battles that should be settled outside the prosecutors office he would prosecute such cases He backed up his words by successfully prosecuting Republican and Democratic petition gatherers  Carol Lucas the onetime Hempstead Commissioner of the Aging and Stephen Kihl a Plainview attorney respectively Among the allegations against Miss Lucas was that she had collected fraudulent signatures for District Attorney Dillon himself in 1981 when he was running for reelection on the Republican as well as his own Democratic ticket Edward Grilli Mr Dillons spokesman said that Miss Lucas was sentenced to community service and Mr Kihl to a conditional discharge as long as he did not run afoul of the law again Mr Cain who until the end insisted that he was being singled out because of his antiabortion stance and who appealed his conviction all the way to the United States Supreme Court was sentenced to 200 hours of community service and a 1500 fine by Judge Harrington He refused to accept the sentence because it would legitimatize his conviction An obviously reluctant Judge Harrington who cited the moral dilemmas of St Thomas More then sentenced Mr Cain to the jail term Mr Dillon in an unusual statement at the time of the sentencing noted that the 13th anniversary of the United States Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion came this month Its unfortunate he said that attention has been deliberately drawn toward a candidate convicted of untruths and away from the more than 15 million unborn killed in this country Mr Dillon a Democrat is up for reelection this year In the past he has been endorsed by the Right to Life Party That is not likely to change because of the Cain case Ellen McCormack a Nassau resident and state chairman of the Right to Life Party said I cant see any problems with Denis Dillon She said he had been very supportive of Right to Life She said she did not want to hurt John Cain but she noted that he had been running as a Republican not as a member of the Right to Life Party despite his position on abortion
U.S. CLINIC BOMBINGS INQUIRY NOW PLEASING MORE GROUPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/us/us-clinic-bombings-inquiry-now-pleasing-more-groups.html,Leaders of several groups concerned about the bombings of abortion clinics around the country say they are now satisfied with the efforts of the Federal lawenforcement authorities In recent months the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been assailed by several leaders of the groups that support womens right to abortion for not mounting a nationwide terrorism investigation into the bombings But now some of the leaders say they no longer seek greater involvement of the FBI Barbara A Radford executive director of the National Abortion Federation which represents 284 abortion service groups around the country said In terms of the arson and the bombings we feel the Feds are doing everything they can do She attributed her change of position on the FBIs role to concerns raised by the American Civil Liberties Union and her satisfaction with the investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms which has jurisdiction The ACLU has said an FBI investigation of the cases could set a precedent for opening wideranging inquiries about other domestic groups Mrs Radford said she was pleased with the work of the firearms bureau in investigating the clinic violence and said she now believed it should retain primary authority for the investigations Some Groups Disagree Her views were largely shared by Fredrica Hodges executive director of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights and Frances Kissling executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice But Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation and Judy Goldsmith president of the National Organization for Women disagreed Miss Goldsmith and Miss Wattleton said they still believed the FBI should open a fullscale investigation into terrorism against the abortion clinics In December the bureaus Director William H Webster was sharply criticized by groups favoring abortion rights for saying the bureau did not regard the abortion clinic bombings as within its definition of terrorism For the bureau to conduct a investigation Mr Webster said there would have to be some evidence that the bombings were the work of a definable group bent on using violence for a political or social end Because no evidence existed that a single group could be held responsible the FBI said the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms assumed jurisdiction as required by a memorandum of understanding setting out each agencys authority Mrs Radford of the National Abortion Federation said Weve learned a lot about law enforcement We dont believe any longer that the FBI should be the lead agency as it relates to arson and bombing She added that she believed the FBI was working quite diligently to provide assistance in the inquiries and that she did not believe it should open a terrorism investigation in connection with the bombing FBI Is Called Correct Jerry Berman legislative counsel to the civil liberties union maintained that the FBI was correct in saying it lacked authority for a domestic security or terrorism investigation as long as no specific group could be linked to the clinic bombings Without an identifiable group we risk having the FBI starting an intelligence investigation of lawful activity Mr Berman said Mr Berman and Mrs Radford and the other representatives of groups favoring abortion rights attended a meeting Wednesday with officials of both lawenforcement agencies They both said they were satified with the commitment of the firearms bureau of 500 of its 1200 special agents to the bombings and with the level of assistance provided by the FBI However Miss Goldsmith said that a fullscale investigation by all relevant Federal agencies was needed immediately and should draw more heavily on the resources of the FBI Miss Wattleton agreed

ABORTION CLINICS REPORT ANXIETIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/us/abortion-clinics-report-anxieties.html,Although bomb threats have become almost routine for those who work in abortion clinics there was a heightened sense of anxiety this weekend with the approaching Presidential inauguration and the 12th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision making abortion legal The Federal Government warned the National Abortion Federation in late December that the inaugural ceremonies today and tomorrow and the anniversary Tuesday presented a time of increased risk And around the country doctors nurses clinic administrators and patients gave graphic descriptions of the physical and psychological stress they have endured as both the right to abortion and the clinics themselves have come under a barrage of threats and attacks In Brockton Mass one of the largest private clinics offering abortions in the nation said Friday that it would do no more In an unsigned statement the physicians of the clinic Goddard Medical Associates said We do not make this decision of our own free will Such acts of terrorism around the country and the constant harassment of our patients and ourselves have forced us to make this decision We continue to affirm that each individual has the full right to choose for him or herself Constant Picketing Cited The medical center which offers a full range of health services sees 250000 patients a year of whom about onetenth of 1 percent go for abortions But the center has been constantly picketed for the past year said a staff member Hallie Baron and received a bomb threat two weeks ago Damage to the building she said would eliminate the prime source of health care for hundreds of thousands of individuals At the Eastern Womens Center in Manhattan yesterday a day with 117 abortions scheduled was interruped by a telephone bomb threat Dozens of women were evacuated to the chilled street some groggy from anesthetic that had just been administered others in the early stages of recovery and many more blue paper gowns under their coats just before they were to enter procedure rooms Its a little disconcerting to have to worry about these people who are willing to hurt adults said Dr William Walden a physician there but everybodys taking it in stride If you didnt you couldnt work here and keep your sanity The patients may have understood but were nonetheless rattled many weeping and some not returning for their appointments Death Threats to Doctors By Federal count there have been 30 instances of bombing firebombing and arson at clinics since May 1982 and some leaders of the abortion rights movement count as many as 60 attacks since 1977 The opposition to abortion has also produced mailed and telephoned death threats against doctors who perform abortions and against young mothers whose babies they delivered In Birmingham Ala last May a man forced his way into the Birmingham Womens Medical Clinic threatened a woman working alone and smashed up the surgery rooms with a sledgehammer The Rev Edward Markley a Roman Catholic priest who has been arrested for incidents at other clinics was charged with assault in the case and has pleaded not guilty A month after the incident Father Markleys superior Bishop Joseph Vath issued a statement that appeared to support the priest If we are convinced that abortion is the taking of innocent life according to Gods revealed word he is not acting unjustly according to Gods law in defending the innocent unborn ones it said The right to life certainly supersedes the right to property or to privacy Armed Guards Employed The clinic now employs armed off duty police officers during working hours One night about two weeks ago a woman called twice to say that her boyfriend was going to bomb the building As of yet we havent had any bombs or fires but I wouldnt be surprised if it were to happen said Belinda Henson the clinic director The Birmingham Police Department canceled offduty time for some officers to guard against violence yesterday between demonstrators favoring and opposing abortion rights Miss Henson said the sledgehammer attack had taken its toll on the woman working at the time She finally quit  it was just the pressure and her physical state said Miss Henson who noted that the woman had a serious disease She says she feels better since she left here An employee of the Summit Medical Center arrived home one night last year to find that her house had been vandalized and her cat beheaded The woman had recently lost a 7monthold baby Miss Henson said and someone telephoned to say that if she had not worked in an abortion clinic the baby would not have died The woman quit her job and moved away Hitting Close to Home In Colorado the Boulder Valley Clinic which Dr Warren Hern helped found in 1973 was firebombed in 1982 Dr Hern now has his own clinic and is the author of a textbook Abortion Practice But when NBC asked him for an interview recently Dr Hern agonized all weekend before consenting Hector Zevallos the doctor kidnapped in Illinois is a friend of mine Dr Hern said referring to the kidnappings in 1982 of an abortion clinic operator and his wife in Granite City Ill Another guy held at gunpoint in Florida is a friend This is really hitting close to home In Forest Grove Ore last Mothers Day weekend Molotov cocktailtype devices were attached to the outside of our building said Dr Peter Bours who operates the Bours Birth and Surgery Center He has delivered some 2100 babies he said and also performs abortions I Am Going to Kill You In June Dr Bours received the first handwritten threat on his life Signed The Fire Bomber he said it warned With your next abortion youre forfeiting your life and the lives of all your staff A second letter threatened him with torture before death In the fall several young women whose babies Dr Bours had delivered received letters threatening death Cindy Laughlin 24 of Tualatin Ore was one She recalled It said After I kill Peter Bours I am going to kill you You are a whore Signed The Fire Bomber  I had a baby there Mrs Laughlin said Ive never had an abortion I dont believe in them It doesnt make much sense In St Louis Carolyn Buhl director of the Preterm Cleveland Clinic an official of the National Abortion Rights Action League said she received periodic bomb threats and that when another clinic there was firebombed in 1978 her clinic took its patients Videotaping of Patients Mrs Buhl said she was concerned that anxiety in the abortion movement might put out a message Hey righttolifers  Im intimidated You win  In no way will I put out that message she added But in Brockton and in isolated places where bombings and cases of arson have destroyed clinics clinics have closed For months last year in Everett Wash patients at a clinic operated by Beverly Whipple and her partner were forced to run a sidewalk gantlet of protesters who videotaped them and took down their car license numbers As many as 700 silent callers jammed their phones by day Miss Whipple said and then last April the clinic was closed by the third case of arson involving gasoline in five months Curtis Beseda who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the case was the county chairman of an initiative drive to end state financing of abortions The initiative was defeated but Miss Whipple and her partner had mortgaged their homes to finance the clinic The women operate another clinic in Yakima but if something goes wrong and we lose the Yakima clinic Miss Whipple said adding Im looking at losing my home

REAGAN'S ACHIEVEMENTS POSE HARD TESTS FOR SECOND TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/us/reagan-s-achievements-pose-hard-tests-for-second-term.html,President Reagan approaches the start of his second term Sunday with the most dramatic successes of his first four years framing the most important and difficult tests of his second After four years in office and a landslide reelection many Presidential scholars say Mr Reagan has already proved himself above average among the nations 40 Presidents But whether history ultimately ranks him among the near great or below average they say is likely to turn on how he handles the challenges of the next four years In foreign policy his aggressive buildup of the nations arsenal of strategic weapons has set the stage to test the Reagan thesis that successful arms control can be achieved only when the United States bargains from a position of strength Arms Control Glory and Risks Already Mr Reagan has turned to that as his first priority and most politicians say that achieving a major arms agreement with the Soviet Union would secure him an important place in history but that failure to strike any accord in his eight years in office could be damaging If Reagan fails on arms control and the arms race goes on to new spirals and gets out of control hell pay a political price in history Kirk ODonnell counsel to House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr said in a comment echoed by others On the domestic side Mr Reagans 25 percent cut in income tax rates and his costly military buildup now require another major assault on budget deficits that have soared over 200 billion The deficits many economists say threaten the economic recovery that has been the keystone to Mr Reagans reelection and popularity Reagan is mortgaged to the economy commented Prof Richard E Neustadt of Harvard University If his luck holds then hell look very wise And if it doesnt hell look perfectly awful History tends to rate Presidents on their first term but maybe this is a President who will be rated more on his second term agreed the Presidential historian James MacGregor Burns of Williams College His place in history is up for grabs Professor Burns went on On the basis of his first term he has been an aboveaverage to good President He could enter the pantheon of Presidents but he could also take a real header and end up down with Calvin Coolidge below average Reagan is living dangerously on both the great criteria foreign policy and domestic economic policy Beyond the specific issues some scholars and politicians question whether Mr Reagan who at the age of 73 takes his official oath of office Sunday will have vigor and command throughout his second term or whether he will be afflicted by the fatigue and disarray that hobbled some earlier Presidents in their second administrations The political and academic communities will be watching Mr Reagans Inaugural Address Monday for clues to his intentions for leadership Some are asking whether he will signal a new burst of Presidential activism with a stirring call to action as Franklin D Roosevelt did in 1937 or whether he will offer a more subdued and prosaic evocation of peace and prosperity as Dwight D Eisenhower did in 1957 In recent weeks Mr Reagans relatively low profile and his willingness to let Senate leaders take the initiative on the budget have invited comparisons with Eisenhower The Ifs of the Second Term If his inaugural sounds more like Roosevelt in 37 than Eisenhower in 57 then well know its the same Reagan we saw at the start of his first term commented David R Gergen former communications director in the Reagan White House Im not clear whether that fire is still there There are some people around the President who are content to say If we can just keep what weve got well have a successful second term That would be a massive change for Reagan himself The inaugural will provide a clue on whether he can regain momentum lay out a plan for the next four years and mobilize the country behind him Second terms have been hard on Presidents even the most respected and many analysts suspect that Mr Reagans second term will be no exception despite the ease of his reelection In his second term Franklin D Roosevelt ran afoul of strong Congressional opposition to his plans to pack the Supreme Court and revamp the Executive Office of the Presidency Woodrow Wilson saw the Senate reject membership in the League of Nations and spent his waning months physically incapacitated Theodore Roosevelt fell into stalemating battles with Congress After his 1948 victory Harry S Truman took his staff to Key West Fla for six weeks and had trouble regaining the political initiative After his 1964 landslide Lyndon B Johnson saw his legislative successes overshadowed by the nations agony in Vietnam In a truncated second term Richard M Nixon had sour relations with Congress over his refusal to spend money that Congress had appropriated even before he was forced to resign Alone among recent Presidents Eisenhower seems to have emerged moderately well in his second term Reagan Associates Are Confident Close associates of President Reagan contend he can break the pattern They cite the bipartisan successes of his second term as Governor of California Moreoever Mr Reagan now enjoys unusually high personal popularity for a modern President about to begin his second term Even opponents credit him with rekindling national pride and patriotism reasserting traditional values and restoring public confidence in the Presidency Thomas E Cronin a presidential scholar at Colorado College rates Mr Reagan strongly as a restoration President In the economic field the 1981 tax cuts the dramatic fall in inflation from 124 percent to 4 percent and the break in the wageprice spiral which some attribute to Mr Reagans handling of the air traffic controllers strike are hallmarks of the Reagan years Despite Mr Reagans efforts to shrink the size of domestic programs Federal spending as a percentage of what Americans spend for goods and services actually rose in his first four years Assessment by Foe and Friend Nonetheless allies and adversaries alike agree that perhaps his major accomplishment has been to punctuate the end of the postNew Deal era by halting the surge of growth and activism in Federal programs and shifting the focus of the national political debate to retrenchment in Government When the liberals start looking at the deficit I think thats a revolution asserted Thomas S Winter editor of the conservative weekly Human Events Yet after his year of legislative triumphs in 1981 Mr Reagans legislative record has been mixed and he has increasingly left political initiatives to Congress Since his reelection he has surprised other politicians moreover with his low profile and by not showing the dynamic aggressive leadership of 1981 His 1984 campaign lacked the specific policy agenda of 1980 In his transition period he has neither aggressively drawn the defeated Democrats into bipartisan efforts on the budget or tax reform nor has he pressed his own Administration to carry out the austere budgetcutting he initially accepted His efforts stalled on his unwillingness to curb Pentagon spending vigorously he let the initiative pass to the Senate With the Democrats holding a 70seat majority in the House of Representative as against 51 seats four years ago and his own Republican Party divided by budding rivalries for the 1988 Presidential nomination Mr Reagan has also agreed to the belated breakup of his highly effective White House political team just as the early maneuvering with Congress begins The Dangerous Fifth Year These developments have raised questions in several quarters about whether he is showing early signs of the secondterm burnout that plagued some of his predecessors In theory the fifth year of a Presidency is an enormous strategic opportunity Professor Neustadt said Its your one and only opportunity in your second term But that opportunity has been messed up every time by tiredness or ebullience and overconfidence My guess is thats already happened in this Administration and history may be repeating itself James L Sundquist a governmental scholar at the Brookings Institution here observed The danger for Reagan is if he seems to be getting more detached I dont see how he can hold the Republicans together Power in our system is always fragmented but it fragments more with a lameduck President People start to follow other leaders Lately Mr Reagan has bristled at suggestions that he has abdicated leadership Aides say his low profile reflects the normal political cycle of introspection and policyformulating after an election Hes just biding his time said Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate majority leader Messages as the Start The next two weeks will give Mr Reagan an ample opportunity to project leadership and dominate debate with his Inaugural Address his State of the Union Message and his Budget Message Moreover if Congress balks he is ready to go to the public as he did so effectively in his first term Well open up with the Inaugural and those other two messages and the President will travel to some key Congressional districts in March and April said Larry Speakes the White House spokesman Some Reagan associates predict a combative President others predict a more bipartisan President Despite pressures from conservative Republicans like Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York to make tax reform the central priority of his second term Mr Reagan is placing arms control and deficit reduction first The Treasury Departments plan for a major overhaul of the tax system and a new effort to revive American financial aid to Nicaraguan rebels will come later Other items such as revamping the executive branch encouraging investment in depressed areas moving against crime revising environmental laws and renewing efforts to ban abortion or promote voluntary school prayer are farther down the list officials say Congress Leaders Are Cautious In the Presidents mind tax simplification is important as important as deficit reduction but not as urgent Mr Speakes said Republican Congressional leaders like Senator Dole and Representative Robert H Michel give it lower priority Mr Dole said If you had a vote today in the Finance Committee on any of the tax packages I dont think youd get three or four votes More bluntly Mr Michel said I dont think youre going to get it in this session  period But Republican leaders regard big cuts in the deficit as vital to prevent an increase in interest rates and inflation that could derail recovery Some economists fear that the strong dollar and the large foreign trade deficit could also become a drag on recovery or the dollar could plummet and touch off a turn downward What Ronald Reagan needs to do is make sure the deficit doesnt make the economy careen out of control said Norm Ornstein a senior scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here I dont think we need 4 percent growth each year But we do need a sense that things are under control not where interest rates and inflation shoot up to unreasonable levels Kevin Phillips author of PostConservative America observes that since World War I economic recessions have afflicted all eight Republican Presidential terms in 1922 1926 1930 1954 1958 1970 1974 and 1982 Antidote With a Hitch As an antidote Mr Reagan has mapped an austerity budget that would eliminate programs like revenue sharing and Amtrak and cut sharply into Medicare Medicaid farm credits and crop subsidies veterans health care and student aid The hitch is that his cuts in military spending are far too small to satisfy Republican leaders let alone Democrats in Congress Unless Mr Reagan gives ground or works out some broad deal with the Democrats Republicans say they fear they cannot achieve the yardstick now accepted by financial markets That is the 50 billion target for deficit reduction proposed by Senator Dole and strongly advocated by Paul A Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Such is the prestige of the chairman of the Fed that he can set the benchmark for the credibility of any deficit cutting action commented Robert D Hormats an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York and a senior economic policy official in four administrations Another Republican worry is that the public will come to regard a strategic arms agreement with the Soviet Union as another touchstone for Mr Reagans secondterm success While White House officials say arms control is Mr Reagans top priority they caution that his commitment is to negotiate seriously not to take just any agreement Mr Reagan has told his negotiators If it isnt a good agreement if it wont work we dont just seek a piece of paper But Democratic strategists contend that the more Mr Reagan asks Congress to allocate money for weapons like the MX missile and a 26 billion research program for a space defense system to gain leverage with Moscow the more he raises public expectations for eventual agreement Some advocates of arms control question whether internal divisions between Defense Secretary Caspar W Weinberger and Secretary of State George P Shultz will eventually hamper arms negotiations Others ask more fundamentally whether Mr Reagan is more dedicated to the idea of strategic defenses than to arms control and will refuse to give up research on military defense if that is Moscows price for reducing its offensive nuclear missiles I think the Presidents deepest emotional commitment is to making the world safer and he sees the way to do that is through strategic defense and other measures said a senior national security official I dont see the President backing away from his commitment to pursue this research
"AT CLINIC, A BOMB THREAT AND 100 ABORTIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/21/nyregion/at-clinic-a-bomb-threat-and-100-abortions.html,Toward the end of a wearisome afternoon Jeannine Michael toured the crowded corridors counseling rooms and recovery area of the Eastern Womens Center a Manhattan clinic that performed nearly 100 abortions that day There Mrs Michael the clinics director of counseling studied the faces and listened to the voices of women who had just returned from a frightening halfhour Saturday in bitter cold on East 60th Street where they had fled because of a telephoned bomb threat Theyre all OK Mrs Michael said in the quiet of her office after no bomb had been found and people had returned to the clinic By that I mean theyre all coping When youre in this field long enough you get such great respect for womens strength These are hard decisions they make and live with and it has to complicate it when you focus public scrutiny on such a private matter Why are they being singled out as targets of abuse How can anyone dare While Mrs Michael talked the busiest day of the week at Manhattans busiest abortion clinic resumed in many ways as if nothing had happened But for the staff and patients the brief scare reminded them of the deepening controversy between those who support womens right to abortion and advocates of the right to life It is a debate that has produced 30 clinic bombings in the country in the last year countless lesser incidents and a warning from the Federal Government that special precautions be taken this week because of the contiguity of President Reagans inauguration and the 12th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision upholding abortion Im an adoptive parent and to see what goes on here bothers me said Police Sgt Tony Michalek of the 19th Precinct who supervised the bomb search But at the same time its their bodies their decision I dont think these righttolife people understand that they may disrupt the clinic but 50 minutes later it starts all over Upstairs Dr Warren D Walden had just completed an abortion on a woman who had been hurried to the street on a stretcher anesthetized when the threatening call came in In the clinics recovery area nurses urged ginger ale and Lorna Doone cookies on another woman who had been wheeled outside in a groggy haze moments after her abortion In other cubicles of the clinic women removed coats they had thrown over their paper gowns and continued asking preparatory questions of counselors who appeared as shaken as the patients The Long Wait Goes On In the reception room 60 chairs again filled with doleful friends and relatives who through a long day of waiting filled trash cans with empty styrofoam cups and crumpled fastfood bags They had come shortly after sunrise when the sky was the color of skim milk and snow swirled in the still streets Some forewarned when they phoned for appointments arrived early enough to miss the pair of antiabortion demonstrators who are at the clinic every Saturday morning Others were confronted by a 63yearold retired antiques dealer and his friend Mary who thrust righttolife literature at them begging them to accept financial help and bear their children Were effective occasionally but not too often said the male protester who declined to give his name and was gone long before the bomb threat Most of them just go by but we do save some On Saturday when a foot patrolman began special roundtheclock duty that will con tinue outside the clinic until Thursday the two protesters dissuaded no one although several women were weeping by the time they entered the building If I want to get their confidence how can I harass them the man asked Were not violent people The violence is inside The clinics director Barbara Methvin acknowledges the protesters with a memorandum for arriving patients The memo apologizes for the unpleasant confrontation and offers extra counseling to anyone troubled by it while noting that the demonstrators have a constitutional right to be there Schedules have also been adjusted for staff members the director said so that those who are most disconcerted by the protests need not work on Saturdays Clinic to Close Tuesday The clinic has decided to close on Tuesday the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision upholding abortions Any woman whos having a hard time because shes Catholic or whatever its rough on them said one 22 yearold staff member herself a Roman Catholic and one of many clinic workers who requested anonymity to avoid harassment I dont worry about my own safety but I worry about the ideology thats the basis for all this I like those people out there said another employee a 27yearold who had an abortion nine years ago and is now married and pregnant If a woman turns around then she doesnt want an abortion and we dont want to give it to her The weekends testiest exchange involved a 26yearold woman who has had several abortions herself and was now accompanying a friend to the clinic Its not a flip decision she shouted at the demonstrators on the street blocking their access to her friend as she entered the building 100 Women Waiting There have got to be 100 women in here she said later waiting with her friend while a 745 AM appointment was delayed until 2 PM because Dr Walden had a long delivery at the New York HospitalCornell Medical Center I look at all of them and I want to hug them but it will be OK You feel bad for a few months but you wont feel bad for the rest of your life Like many other women at the clinic all of whom chose not to be identified this woman and her friend  both college educated and working  talked of their aspirations for themselves and their future children Its very difficult especially for black women one said I read all these articles about single women having babies but weve always had to do that It may sound selfish but money is so important You have to be financially solvent because the man might be around and he might not You can raise kids with everything and they still turn out bad With nothing you wind up with little hoodlums Many of the women at the clinic accepted birthcontrol advice but staff members acknowledge that 45 percent of those having abortions  a total of 13708 last year  are repeat clients a typical figure for a clinic that serves lowincome patients Back Alley Days Recalled Maybe we make it too easy for them Dr Walden said but if it wasnt for clinics like this wed still be doing it in back alleys I was a resident in the 60s and I cant tell you how many maternal deaths I saw from septic abortions The most controversial abortions are those in the second trimester of pregnancy a dilation and evacuation procedure that the Eastern Womens Center added last July and that now accounts for 30 percent of their business Dr Walden said he no longer did these abortions because its a much more involved unpleasant procedure Dr Waldens concern did not seem to be on the minds of the weekend patients who were consumed with worries of their own husbands or parents unaware of their whereabouts birthcontrol methods that had frightened or failed them a bomb threat that had cast them into the street in front of curious strangers at such a traumatic moment One such woman was a tableau of sadness as she shook herself awake on a stretcher

U.S. SAYS 3 PLANNED MORE CLINIC BOMBS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/21/us/us-says-3-planned-more-clinic-bombs.html,Lawenforcement officials who were involved in the arrests Saturday of three men accused of abortion clinic bombings in this area said today that evidence had been discovered indicating the suspects had planned further bombings The authorities said they did not know if dates had been set for other attacks But they said they were relieved to have the three in custody before Tuesday the 12th anniversary of the Supreme Courts decision that legalized abortion The authorities have said the anniversary posed a risk for violent protests In response the National Organization for Women has organized vigils at clinics around the country beginning this weekend Jack Killorin chief of public affairs for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms which headed the investigation declined to discuss whether the evidence showed other attacks were planned He would say only that in a search last night of the home of a suspect agents found explosives and components for explosive devices One in February 1984 According to Stephen Higgins director of the firearms bureau the three men are being charged with eight bombings in this part of the country beginning last Feb 17 with the bombing of the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk Va Mr Killorin said that as a result of the investigation his bureau had raised to 31 from 30 the number of incidents believed to be the work of zealous opponents of abortion This is because investigators found evidence linking the three new suspects to a pipe bomb planted in November at the office here of the American Civil Liberties Union which has backed the right to abortion That incident had not previously been regarded as related to the abortion question Mr Killorin said The seven other bombings charged to the suspects were all at facilities offering abortions or family planning help in Washington Maryland and Virginia Investigators said they were trying to see if the three men had been involved in the two incidents in this area remaining unsolved They were at a Prince Georges County Md abortion facility and at one in Dover Del Investigators are also seeking to learn if any other accomplices might have been involved Suspects in Their 30s The three men who are being held for bail hearings Tuesday seemed to fit the pattern in terms of age and occupation of others arrested in similar incidents around the country They were identified as Thomas Eugene Spinks of Bowie Md 36 years old Kenneth William Shields of Laurel Md 34 and Michael Donald Bray of Bowie 32 According to Mr Killorin Mr Spinks whose house was searched last night ran two businesses from his home Bowie Roofing and a chimney sweep service called Top Hat and Tails Mr Bray he said worked as a housepainter And Mr Shields had recently begun a job as controller for a company called Virginia Wire and Steel in Warrenton Va Mr Bray was temporarily living at a motel there An affidavit filed by an alcohol and tobacco bureau agent John R Schworm in support of an application for a warrant to search Mr Spinkss home was released tonight It describes how the bureau identified Mr Spinks and Mr Shields as suspects in the bombings An affidavit pertaining to Mr Bray has not yet been made public How Investigation Proceeded First the bureau closely analyzed the materials used in each of the explosions Officials explained that agents then questioned chemical companies in the area to determine whether any had made recent sales of materials used in the clinic bombings The affidavit said the investigators learned from a Batimore company InlandLeidy Inc that a man who identified himself as Ken Shields had ordered and picked up chemicals last July 10 On July 12 a person who gave his name as Lou Burns and described himself as a representative of Shields Industries ordered and picked up explosive chemicals from Maryland Chemicals in Baltimore the affidavit said A Lou Burns of Shields Industries also purchased used carbon dioxide cylinders from a company called FM Fire Protection Services in Hyattsville Md the papers continued According to the affidavit the proprietor of FM said he had never before sold used cylinders and explained that the cylinders must by law be stamped with the date and name of the refiller Tracing Fingerprints The affidavit said that the evidence collected at several of the bomb scenes included cylinders that could be traced to those purchased by Lou Burns from FM It also said that fingerprints were found on tape used in the device left at the ACLU bombing The papers said the prints were traced to Mr Spinks whom officials said had a record of previous misdemeanor arrests in Maryland for battery and malicious destruction of property The affidavit said that in an interview last week Mr Shields said he and Mr Spinks had purchased chemicals from InlandLeidy in order to begin their own mail order chemical business Then last Thursday while he was under surveillance by firearms agents Mr Spinks was observed purchasing pyrotechnic fuses from a hobby shop in Waldorf Md the account continued In a second interview that day the papers said Mr Shields related that Mr Spinks sometimes used the name Lou Burns to purchase chemicals According to that account Mr Shields also told the agent that he had seen carbon dioxide cylinders in Mr Spinkss garage and that Mr Spinks had described to him how he used the cylinders to make bombs Fairly Sophisticated Bombs Mr Higgins said the devices used in the bombings had been fairly sophisticated but declined to say if it was known how the men got experience with explosives Some of the bombings caused a lot of damage including one Jan 1 at the Hillcrest Womens Center a private clinic on southeast Pennsylvania Avenue The onestory brick building was extensively damaged and windows across the street were shattered In two earlier incidents of the eight both in Maryland on Nov 19 a building housing the Metropolitan Medical and Womens Center was gutted by fire and a blast caused serious damage to the Randolph Medical Building which housed a Planned Parenthood office In the Hillcrest Center bombing a caller telephoned The Washington Times to claim responsibility for the Army of God East Coast Division but Mr Higgins said his agency did not give any credence to the call With 20 out of 31 cases solved there is still no evidence of a national organization or conspiracy called the Army of God Mr Killorin said Warning Issued by US The bureau of alcohol and firearms issued a warning late last month to the National Abortion Federation that the anniversary Tuesday of the Supreme Courts abortion decision might mean increased danger of violence Of the three suspects Mr Killorin said today We feel much better knowing what these three will be doing Tuesday We were concerned about activity in this area We feel much better but we will still continue our investigation and operational activity through this sensitive period He declined to specify what plans the bureau had to prevent violence in the days leading up to the anniversary Barbara A Radford executive director of the National Abortion Federation said in response to the arrests I feel a real sense of relief

PRESIDENT PRAISES FOES OF ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/23/us/president-praises-foes-of-abortion.html,President Reagan today lent his support to one of the largest antiabortion marches ever in the capital telling tens of thousands of demonstrators that the tide of history was with them The crowd which the police estimated at 71500 people filled Pennsylvania Avenue for 15 blocks on a windy and bitterly cold day I feel a great sense of solidarity with all of you Mr Reagan said The momentum is with us First to Address Rally Mr Reagan is the first President to address the demonstrators in the 12 year history of March for Life generally held on the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortions legal The President spoke by telephone and sound system from the Oval Office as the crowd of marchers swelled beneath the Washington Monument a quarter of a mile away before advancing down the broad avenue to the Supreme Court Building The crowd warmed by Mr Reagans support cheered lustily in the numbing cold They cheered too although less loudly when he cautioned that violence against abortion clinics had no place in the national debate We cannot condone the threatening or taking of human life to protest the taking of human life by way of abortion Mr Reagan said Of the overall dispute he said Surely recent advances in medical technology have changed the debate Surgeons now speak of the patient in the womb He also predicted that an antiabortion videotape The Silent Scream could have a powerful influence on Congress A copy of the tape was delivered to the White House before Mr Reagan spoke and a White House spokesman said the President had seen it For the first time through the new technique of realtime ultrasound imaging were able to see with our own eyes on film the abortion of a 12weekold unborn child Mr Reagan said He said the film provides chilling documentation of the horror of abortion Its been said that if every member of Congress could see that film they would move quickly to end the tragedy of abortion Mr Reagan said and I pray that they will Nellie J Gray founder and president of March for Life told Mr Reagan at the end of their loudspeaker conversation We want the paramount human life amendment with no compromises and Mr Reagan said Good for you and I support you That amendment would not permit abortion even to save the life of the mother Mr Reagan has previously endorsed the life of the mother as valid ground for an abortion and the White House said this afternoon that his position was unchanged The film the President mentioned is part of a broad effort by antiabortion activists to place more graphic depictions of abortion before the public The Rev Jerry Falwell who addressed the rally along with a number of members of Congress said As soon as we can show the pictures in prime time the same way we have shown the starving children in Ethiopia the big American heart will respond and say stop it  The three commercial television networks broadcast brief excerpts from The Silent Scream today as part of their evening news programs Producer Praises Work Dr Bernard N Nathanson a former director of an abortion clinic and a founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League who has since become a strong antiabortion activist produced the film We believe everyone now should see it particularly women who are considering abortions he said at a Capitol Hill screening This should be an integral part of any informed consent procedure After the march Dr Nathanson Miss Gray and 20 other leaders of the antiabortion coalition met for about half an hour with Surgeon General C Everett Koop and Margaret M Heckler the Secretary of Health and Human Services to discuss government financing of abortions Buses Bring Them In If the Nathanson film is the newest weapon in the battle for public sentiment the march is one of the oldest although it has never before received the attention that Mr Reagans welcome gave it today A loosely organized effort grounded in local churches and antiabortion groups it began with the arrival of hundreds of buses which rolled into Washington Monday night and this morning They continued to arrive and the crowd on the Ellipse grew as Mr Reagan spoke and they began leaving around 430 PM carrying the demonstrators back home to dozens of states Before they left they streamed in groups down the corridors of the Capitol to lobby the offices of their Congressmen and massed at the bottom of the Supreme Court steps A quiet well ordered wall of capped and mittened humanity they sang Jesus Loves the Little Children and bristled with signs protesting the Courts decision in Roe v Wade 12 years ago Abort the Supreme Court one placard read Supreme Court Turned Our Children Into Garbage read another posted on a garbage bag with small mannikin legs protruding from it The Court had taken unusual security measures locking the front door and closing off some

State Their Case By United Press International Groups that support legal abortion criticized the President and called for stronger measures to end violence at abortion facilities President Reagan callously ignores the real significance of Jan 22 the National Abortion Rights Action League said contending that the courts decision ended centuries in which women were denied a full range of legal options for dealing with their unintended pregnancies The activities in Washington were mirrored by similar pro and con observances across the nation In Kansas single roses and tiny loaves of bread were placed on the desks of state legislators symbols of each side in the ongoing controversy Supporters of abortion rights called a mass rally in a Chicago church while antiabortionists held demonstrations at four abortion clinics Demonstrations on both sides of the issue were held across Connecticut And in California lobbyists from both sides converged on the Capitol for a series of

WASHINGTON;   A SUBVERSIVE PROPOSAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/23/opinion/washington-a-subversive-proposal.html,WASHINGTON In most democratic countries at the beginning of a new term in office the chief executive defines his philosophy and outlines his policies before the representatives of the people who at once debate his propositions in the Congress assembled We dont do it that way in the United States We have a Presidential inaugural address on television  sort of a speech from the throne  which is then turned over to Tom Brokaw Dan Rather Peter Jennings and others who say many sensible things usually after most of the television audience has switched to something else President Reagan made an eloquent address full of glittering phrases and nostalgic dreams but it didnt inaugurate a coherent discussion of his claims or proposals but merely a jumble of opinions to scattered audiences The vague thought in this corner is that it might make more sense better politics and even better television if after the inaugural and State of the Union addresses by the President Congress insisted on equal time for a serious debate over national television on what the President said This is not a wholly new idea Bertrand Russell once suggested that it might change the politics of the world if we had periodic debates on a resolution that it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true Suppose just for fun  though its not very funny  we applied this sensible suggestion to some of President Reagans favorite inaugural speech passages  We must act now he said to protect future generations from governments desire to spend its citizens money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in  Our twoparty system    has served us well over the years but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans united in a common cause     With heart and hand let us stand as one today one people under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past     We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal establishment You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster And I dont believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course All this made news and glorious television pictures among the statues and vast historic paintings along the walls of the Rotunda and beyond that it gave a warm feeling of hope when the bands and choirs sang the old hymns and anthems But after all the hoopla here theres a problem The President has called on the Democrats for bipartisan cooperation on the policies in which he believes but denounces them for not believing in them He wants to increase the military budget reduce the social budget defend the rich and help the poor all of which he supported in his inaugural speech And he still hopes the Democrats will support him on policies they reject He is not going to get this support from either the Democrats or the Republican leaders in Congress who admired his speech but reject his dreams and oppose his policies The snowy inaugural weekend is over with its emphasis on the President and the battle will now be fought in Congress where he took his oath of office Congress is simply not going to go along with his budget It is terrified of his budget deficits and however admiring of his rhetoric and popularity skeptical of his assumption that he can grow out of the most alarming budget and trade deficits in history This is not merely a partisan problem Republican leaders in Congress particularly the Senate majority leader Robert Dole of Kansas are insisting that the Presidents inauguration speechs dreams are admirable for the present but may be disastrous for the future and may very well turn over control of the Senate to the Democrats in the midterm elections of 1986 So even the Presidents most loyal supporters and admirers of his ideas and ideals are urging him to be careful not to think his successes of the past are a sensible guide to the future They are saying that its not wise to believe in some of his propositions  like constitutional amendments to balance the budget or wipe out abortion  when theres no ground for believing he can prevail or avoid debating it not merely on television but in CongressB

BISHOP CALLS ABORTION SUIT RIGHTS ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/25/nyregion/bishop-calls-abortion-suit-rights-issue.html,A dozen years ago Howard J Hubbard was known as a street priest a liberal fighter against the Establishment Friday his lawyers will go into court here to pose the first legal challenge in memory by a Roman Catholic bishop to the opening of an abortion clinic Bishop Hubbard brought the suit in State Supreme Court here on Jan 11 after Planned Parenthood received approval from the State Health Department to begin providing abortions at two of its clinics Arguing that the department had conducted only a cursory investigation before approving the applications the Bishop won an order blocking a final license until Fridays hearing Some friends from the civilrights activities of his young priesthood and the humanservices community in which he is active as Bishop of Albany are uptight about the suit Bishop Hubbard said Certain tensions have been created Might Surprise Some He conceded that in a world full of Roman Catholic clergymen who are outspoken critics of abortion it might surprise some that one of his liberal background should be the first to sue But there is no real conflict he said  I personally feel mine is the traditional liberal position As he sees it the Bishop said he is trying to defend the civil rights of a group of people and were trying to expand who belongs in the human community Ruth Klepper executive director of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood said the civil rights argument was particularly galling It offends people who do not believe he is the keeper of everybodys conscience she said She added that the suit should be viewed in perspective This follows a Presidential campaign in which OConnor decided to make abortion the issue Bishop Hubbard said he had not consulted any outsiders  prominent critics of abortion like Archbishop John J OConnor of the New York Archdiocese for instance  before filing his lawsuit Nor does he see it as a test case Narrow Grounds in Case Rather he said the situation here involves a particular set of circumstances and very narrow grounds that are unlikely to be duplicated elsewhere Essentially his lawyers argue that the approval slipped through the Health Department without adequate notice But having noted that the Bishop added that his opposition to abortion was total and that he would do everything legally possible to stop it A slight softvoiced 46yearold with pale reddish hair the Bishop spoke in the chancery office around the corner of snowsplotched Washington Park from one of two clinics that will begin providing abortions if his lawyers fail to block state approval The one here would be at Planned Parenthood headquarters at 259 Lark Street a modest twostory brick building in a section of bow windowed town houses many decorated with historical markers an architectural throwback to the old Albany The other would be in the city of Hudson Bishop Hubbard said he had changed and Albany had changed since the days when he organized tenants started drug programs and fought against construction of the complex of state office buildings that has been named the Nelson A Rockefeller Empire State Plaza in honor of its sponsor Born on Halloween in 1938 in nearby Troy Howard James Hubbard was brought up there studied for the priesthood at Mater Christi Seminary in Albany and in 1966 was assigned to work in the black slums of the citys depressed South End some of which was knocked down to make way for the state plaza The young priest was fresh from the seminary when he went down there to set up a referral and crisis intervention center called Providence House William Kennedy notes in his book O Albany a series of neighborhood and personal profiles The levelheaded intelligence and humanitarianism he displayed at Providence House Mr Kennedy wrote helped set him on the path to bishop They were lively days setting up drug programs and helping create political awareness in the black community That agitation Bishop Hubbard said brought about changes in the way the government dealt with the people  more equal rather than paternalistic Everyone knew he said that the late Erastus Corning 2d Mayor from 1941 to 1983 was always willing to listen to people But now they were able to demand a response Another Change in Politics That was only one change in the small world of Albany politics Assemblyman Richard J Conners who has spent most of his life in Albany politics remembers another When he was little he said My father told me to respect the Pope the Bishop and the pastor and fourth but unspecified I think he wanted to add the county chairman The citys collective personality remains Catholic but the checkitwith thechancery view has long faded politicians say I dont have a great deal of relationships with the political structure Bishop Hubbard said Most of my involvement is ceremonial In his youth he said he had always heard about tieins between church and state He smiled and shrugged In my experience he said its not the case He was appointed the ninth Bishop of Albany in 1977 and inevitably his life changed as he became an administrator a leader several steps removed from the street people he used to work with But he remembers I spent so many of the first years of my priesthood at Albany County Jail in hospital emergency rooms in police court Now the Bishop runs a diocese of 201 parishes in 14 counties with more than 400000 Catholics and he is prominent in church affairs well beyond this city as chairman of the state Catholic Conference Public Policy Committee Does he ever feel like reverting to the old days and say leading a rent strike He grinned Like once a

DEBATE ON ABORTION FOCUSES ON GRAPHIC FILM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/25/us/debate-on-abortion-focuses-on-graphic-film.html,A graphic film showing an abortion has become the latest focal point in a growing national debate over the procedure The film being widely distributed by opponents of abortion purports to show a 12weekold fetus screaming in pain as it is aborted by a suction process But those who favor the right to abortion say the film is misleading And the prevailing expert medical opinion appears to be that while the film dramatically depicts an abortion the narrators contention that the fetus is screaming in pain is inaccurate and dishonest Abortion opponents dismiss this medical consensus as rationalization Wide Distribution The 28minute film The Silent Scream is narrated by Dr Bernard N Nathanson a New York gynecologist who says he once supported abortion and now opposes it In the film which is being distributed by American Portrait Films of Anaheim Calif Dr Nathanson first explains the various stages of fetal development and then demonstrates in graphic detail how an abortion is performed The videotape was apparently made through ultrasound a technique using highfrequency sound waves to produce an image of the fetus Parts of the film have been aired on news programs of the three major television networks and according to its producers it is being sent to members of Congress and the Justices of the Supreme Court Reagan Mentioned Film President Reagan said Tuesday that if every member of Congress could see that film they would move quickly to end the tragedy of abortion What is at issue medically is what if anything a fetus of 12 weeks perceives in a suction abortion Dr Nathanson states in his narration We see the childs mouth open in a silent scream This is the silent scream of a child threatened imminently with extinction But leading pediatric neurologists and neuroembyologists say that while much is still unknown about sensory development in the fetus it is virtually impossible for a 12weekold fetus to experience pain Its a desperately bad thing to imply said Dr Robert Eiben president of the Nationl Child Neurology Society who is a pediatric neurologist at Case Western Reserve Medical Center in Cleveland There is a difference between a reflex and a subjective experience Idea Called Erroneous Dr Hart Peterson acting chairman of pediatric neurology at New York Hospital at Cornell Medical Center in New York agreed The notion that a 12week fetus screams in discomfort is erroneous Dr Peterson said If you take out an earthworm and poke it with a stick it responds too Dr Edwin C Myer chairman of the department of pediatric neurology at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond said To make a statement that the fetus feels pain is a totally ridiculous statement Pain implies cognition There is no brain to receive the information Dr Nathanson disputes these views Pain is a reflex Dr Nathanson said yesterday It is not an intellectual exercise The fetus he said is being stuck and stalked and responds reflexively as any animal would when exposed to pain A Question of Motion Dr Nathansons narration in the film reflects this As the suction device is used Dr Nathanson is heard to say The child will rear away from it and undergo much more violent much more agitated movements The child is now moving in a much more purposeful manner The child is agitated and moving in a violent manner Leading pediatric neurologists and other specialists of neuroembryology agree that the fetus moves But this movement these specialists say is a reflex response that is too primitive to speak of in terms of pain They say it is not unlike the reflex elicited in a brain dead individual whose foot recoils when touched Nerves Lacking Till 24 Weeks These specialists explain that a fetus of 12 weeks has muscle reflexes but that the fetus has not yet developed nerve cell pathways in the brains cortex that would enable it to experience pain According to these specialists these nerve cell pathways which permit an electrical nerve impulse to travel from the sensors in the brain back to the muscle do not begin to develop in the fetus until at least 24 weeks and even then it is not clear what pain a fetus might experience In order to scream one would have to have synapses in the cortex said Dr Pasko Rakic chairman of neuroanatomy at the Yale University School of Medicine who is one of the nations leading experts in neuroembryology David OSteen executive director of the National Right to Life Committee disagreed We know that if you prick the unborn child hell move away Mr OSteen said and I think there is ample evidence the child feels pain Mr OSteen said he believed the film would be the equivalent for the movement against abortion of Uncle Toms Cabin the 1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe that rallied national opinion against slavery Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said she thought the film was interesting and that people should see it but without the narration I dont think you see what Bernie Nathanson says you see Miss Falkenberg said He draws conclusions based on his belief systems that are not grounded in fact

AN AGENCY STEPS OUT OF OBSCURITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/weekinreview/an-agency-steps-out-of-obscurity.html,The debate over Federal efforts to end the recent violence directed at abortion clinics has thrust a littleknown law enforcement agency into the public spotlight for the first time since Eliot Ness one of its agents tracked gangsters through Prohibition Chicago The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms known to some as ATF is not exactly a household word concedes its director Stephen E Higgins But he notes that it has solved 22 of the 31 abortionrelated bombings that have occurred since May 1982 and that many of those arrested have been been convicted and sentenced to long prison terms Were used to not being in the limelight said Mr Higgins but were proud of what we do What the bureau does has changed greatly over the years  its name describing the sequence in which it has taken on its responsibilities It traces its heritage to 1791 when Alexander Hamilton then Secretary of the Treasury placed a tax on spirits that led to the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion The tax was abandoned in 1802 but reinstated to help finance the Civil War when three detectives were hired to ferret out tax evaders That was the beginning of a lawenforcement operation that has gone through numerous incarnations As recently as 1962 90 percent of the bureaus resources were committed to uncovering the production of moonshine largely in the Southeast But the figure has sunk to 1 percent as illicit stills have become largely a thing of the past The bureau remains active in licensing the liquor industry and in regulating its labeling advertising and trade practices Its regulation of liquor and tobacco brings in 10 billion a year making it the nations second largest producer of tax revenues right behind the Internal Revenue Service In 1942 the bureau gained jurisdiction over firearms laws  which has led it into narcotics investigations According to Phillip C McGuire the deputy director in charge of law enforcement more than half of the 2293 people turned over by the bureau for prosecution under firearms laws in 1984 were drug dealers or had a history of drug involvement Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 the bureau also licenses 250000 firearms dealers and insures that dealers and manufacturers keep proper records on all transactions Although it does not keep records of its own on the 250 million guns in the nation its National Firearms Training Center traces 35000 guns used in crimes each year According to Mr McGuire the center has a success rate of better than 90 percent in tracing guns that are less than 10 years old He noted The firearm used to shoot President Reagan was traced by us in just 17 or 18 minutes It took three phone calls In 1981 the Reagan Administration attempted to abolish the bureau as a budgetcutting measure and to divide its functions between the Secret Service and the Customs Service both like the bureau branches of the Treasury Department The Administration proposal which gun control advocates considered would have been a major victory for the National Rifle Association was blocked by Congress The AntiArson Act of 1982 broadened the bureaus jurisdiction over arson and explosives which it had gained under the Explosives Control Act of 1970 It now operates 14 arson task forces that investigate major fires and has four highly trained national response teams to handle the most serious cases Their solution rate far exceeds the norm in solving arson and explosion cases Mr McGuire said The national norm is 10 percent but its 60 percent for the response teams The bureaus current budget of 170 million provides for a staff of 3000 including 1200 special agents stationed around the country Bureau officials say they never doubted their ability to handle the abortion clinic bombings They took jurisdiction under a longstanding agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that gives the FBI prime authority only when a bombing occurs at a Federal building or an institution that receives Federal funds or when the incident meets the Justice Department definition of an act of terrorism The definition of terrorism became a controversial issue a few months ago when proabortion leaders expressed outrage at the decision of FBI Director William H Webster that the clinic bombings could not be classified as terrorism because no single group was believed responsible for the incidents Therefore he said the ATF was leading the bombing investigations with the FBI ready to offer any help it needed The ATF assigned more than 500 agents to the case bringing in experts from around the country Their success in solving most of the bombings which Mr Higgins attributes to old fashioned police work has won it the strong approval of many prochoice leaders Mr Higgins said that he could understand why his bureaus presence had not been more warmly greeted at the start Admittedly were not as well known as the FBI The desire for greater public recognition he said was a key reason why the bureau has been debating a possible name change for at least 10 years We cant change it now Mr McGuire interjected Were too wellknown
THE DEMOCRATS' ECONOMIC VACUUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/business/the-democrats-economic-vacuum.html,Ann Crittenden writes on economic issues from Washington WASHINGTON THE Democratic Party is in trouble And a large part of the problem is the partys inability to enunciate an economic policy that stands a chance of capturing the imagination of the electorate in the way that Ronald Reagans antigovernment progrowth rhetoric has done The Democrats ignominious defeat in November was among other things a resounding rejection of the New Deal creed of evermore beneficent government programs that has dominated the party for half a century Whats worse the polls were scarcely closed before the Republicans had stolen and run away with the issue of tax reform one of the few new ideas put forward with any vigor in recent years by some of the younger more pragmatic Democratic members of Congress Perhaps worst of all the crushing election defeat did almost nothing to decide the issue of where future Democratic policy should go The same divisions that were apparent during the battle for nomination are still there between the older biggovernment Democratic liberals in Congress and some of the younger probusiness Democrats between tax reformers and politicians who are comfortable with the current jerrybuilt code and the munificent political contributions it generates between interest groups determined to hold on to their share of the status quo and dreamers who want changes in education and labor markets entitlement programs military and international economic policy These differences overlap and intertwine clouding what Democratic economics means today And few politicians here believe that the policy vacuum will be filled until a strong new political figure emerges Theyre not going to come to grips with a coherent economic policy at the moment said an economic adviser to one of the most influential young Democrats in the Senate The partys quandary is deepened by the fact that the Democrats seem afraid to turn to their own fringes particularly on the Left for inspiration Unlike the Republicans who during their own dark days refreshed their economic thinking by adopting some of the unpopular radical ideas on their own Right including supplyside economics reducing the size of civilian government and banning abortion many Democrats virtually never speak to radical thinkers on the Left Democrats are also reluctant to consider such fresh probusiness ideas as eliminating the capital gains taxes for entrepreneurs That leaves them milling around in search of new insights in a very narrow place  that slightly right of center territory already crowded with Republicans They are also trying to emulate Republican success on television Some worry that in the future the Democrats will be more preoccupied with the medium than the message One 20year veteran of Democratic politics said The new guys teach it round or flat whatever their pollster wants They want to get there without much caring what the vehicle is In talking with Democrats old and new there is today only one ever so faint signal indicating a potentially captivating Democratic message for the 80s Party sympathizers as diverse as George Perry of the Brookings Institution who advised Walter Mondale in the Presidential race and Samuel Bowles a radical economics professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst agree on it The idea simply put is that economic growth should be pursued with and as a result of greater equality  neither objective needs to be sacrificed to achieve the other Growth of a crueler sort ignoring distribution concerns they say has become Republican doctrine In the 1930s said Mr Bowles the Democratic Party found a way to argue that what was good politics and good values was also good economics that what ought to be done could be done and would make the economy better The idea was to expand governments social programs put money in the hands of people who didnt have any and the whole economy would revive and prosper The Democratic Party today he explained has to define new grounds for its old argument that more democracy and more equality will make the economy work better rather than worse Mr Perry makes a similar argument Economic growth has always been the name of the game but what the Democrats have to do is stick to the principles he says There are social priorities that go beyond just the marketplace  things the government ought to do These are not just consistent with growth but necessary for growth Protecting the environment and education are probably the two big ones Reagan somehow has painted these issues as problems that are not related to growth which is 100 percent nonsense Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey who with Representative Richard A Gephardt Democrat of Missouri crafted a sweeping program of tax reform in 1983 sees that issue as an opportunity to support both growth and equity I have a very clear point of view about where the Democratic Party has to go on economic policy declares Senator Bradley It has to get foursquare behind fundamental tax reform It gives us the opportunity to seize the growth issue by lowering overall tax rates and eliminating deductions for special interests It would demonstrate once again that were the party of fairness by advocating a system with much greater equity And it would make government more understandable to people Unfortunately for Senator Bradley and Representative Gephardt however the Republicans saw the appeal of tax reform before their own party did Both legislators briefed Mr Mondale on their tax proposal last summer and Walter W Heller the University of Minnesota economist says that he and other Mondale economic advisers including Joseph Pechman and Mr Perry recommended that Mr Mondale pick up the issue of tax reform during the campaign All were disappointed Mr Heller said when he virtually ignored the advice As soon as the Reagan victory was announced the Administration dropped its own sweeping reform plan on an astonished Congress Senator Bradley denies that this was a Republican coup We would win either way he maintained recently If the Democrats and the Republicans get behind tax reform and the President really takes on the special interests we will share the limelight If he doesnt the Democrats have a remarkable opportunity to take the lead on the issue Either way the party benefits    if the Democrats go with it he added revealing a soft spot in his optimistic analysis The problems of linking growth with equity are many as Senator Hart found out during his run for the Presidency Many of his new ideas  including improved education in mathematics and science more worker participation in management better child care systems and individual training accounts to finance the retraining of displaced workers through voluntary contributions from the workers and their employers  were variations on the theme that people are the greatest productive asset of all and that governmentassisted investments in people far from slowing economic growth can actually promote it But Mr Harts theme clashed head on with the interests of such powerful Democratic constituencies as the industrial unions and the teachers groups whose support is essential to anyone seeking the partys Presidential nomination The problem is that almost all serious original thinking about economic policy is being done by the younger Democrats  while the power to swing the nomination remains in the hands of the constituency groups summed up one veteran House Democratic staff member Among the younger party leaders he included Senator Bradley 42 Representative Gephardt 44 Representative Timothy E Wirth of Colorado 46 Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee 37 and Senator Joseph R Biden of Delaware 43 Back in the 1960s when Democrats ran on the issue of growth it was easy to believe that an expanding economy could provide everyone with a larger share of pie Now the Democrats recognize that the pie isnt expanding rapidly anymore and some would like to refocus on growth and tell their constituency groups to go home commented Barry Bosworth a Brookings Institution economist Since the Republicans took away the growth issue  with the 1980 victory of Reagan and the supply siders  the younger Democrats are searching for a new set of proposals to put them back in the forefront of the growth issue In the early 80s industrial policy was such an attempt Broadly defined this is the idea that government industry and labor should find ways to phase out declining industries and to stimulate the growth of new hightech internationally competitive industries But largely because of fears that such a policy would end up producing bigger government and even greater subsidization of the blue collar jobs that are the backbone of the party the idea fizzled and was utterly ignored in the Presidential race Even Robert Reich the Harvard political economist whose name is most closely associated with industrial policy says Within the Beltway  which means in political Washington  industrial policy is dead But Mr Reich argues that the notion is becoming even more important in terms of policies dealing with international competitiveness The problem of distinguishing a Democratic from a Republican economic policy is that todays leading Republican economists  Martin S Feldstein Herbert Stein and Alan Greenspan  share Democratic beliefs in basic Keynesianism the notion that the economy can be fine tuned and that a proper mix of monetary and fiscal policy is essential to set matters right again At the same time ironically the theoretical model that economists of both parties have embraced is increasingly unable to describe reality Conventional economic forecasts are off the mark with such regularity that mainstream theory has been seriously discredited in both parties As a result Democratic policy makers who are interested in retooling their thinking no longer automatically turn as in the past to a single group of macroeconomists or to think tanks like Brookings Instead they are talking not just to economists pollsters and media consultants but also to a wider range of social scientists  people who are concerned with the political economy with structure and organization The issues that concern these thinkers are not just monetary and fiscal policy but also such microeconomic issues as the rigidity and instability of Americas labor markets the stubborn discrimination against blacks and women the sluggishness of productivity the weaknesses in American education and job training See box Some analysts say that leadership in these often prickly issues is more likely to emerge on a state than Federal level The leverage for policy initiatives is greater there with a collective state budget surplus of more than 50 billion some estimate In the view of Brookings Mr Bosworth special interests are often more flexible in localities and on the state level than at the national level and many of the most divisive issues such as income redistribution programs have been foisted off on the Federal Government As Mr Bosworth noted It is easier for people to see a direct connection between the taxes they pay and the benefits they receive from state programs Perhaps this is why Mr Bosworth said a few state Democratic leaders have shown a degree of unconventional thinking rarely seen at the Federal level Arizona Governor Bruce E Babbitt for example has attracted attention by suggesting among other things limiting health and pension benefits and farm subsidies for the wealthy It remains to be seen whether any of the Democratic state leaders will emerge as national figures In the meantime some Democrats take comfort in the fact that Republicans are at least as divided over economic policy as they are The differences between orthodox Republicans like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and the supplysiders in the Republican camp are at least as great as the divisions within the Democratic ranks But the Republicans unlike their rivals have a leading man who can drown out their cacophony with stirring rhetoric SEEKINGGROWTH THROUGH EQUITY WASHINGTON A number of fresh ideas to achieve economic growth through greater equity are floating around these days much as characters in search of a play One idea that has begun to attract attention in England and at universities here is outlined in The Share Economy a new book by MIT economist Martin L Weitzman Under the existing fixed wage system Mr Weitzman argues workers are paid a predetermined piece of the income pie before the pie is even out of the oven Thus a companys wage bill is independent of the companys health a system that stabilizes the income of those with jobs but loads unemployment on others and inflation on everyone he says He proposes instead that a larger share of workers earnings be paid through a form of profit sharing based on a fixed percentage of corporate revenues with the employer receiving the remaining percentage Then companies would have an incentive to hire new workers to increase total revenues There would be a secondary effect as well to sell the extra output produced by extra workers companies would have to hold down prices If a large number of major corporations introduced such profitsharing as each expanded and hired more workers labors total purchasing power would rise and so would the demand for goods and services Mr Weitzman argues According to Lester Thurow another MIT economist the idea could offer a way out of the tradeoff between inflation and fullemployment bedeviling every economy with a fixedwage rate system Education provides another obvious link between economic growth and equity An area attracting increasing interest is more preschool education of 3 and 4yearolds as evidence mounts that disadvantaged children who obtain quality early education become more productive citizens Several studies support this conclusion most notably an analysis of minority children with one to two years of preschool education in Ypsilanti Mich By age 19 more of these children had graduated from high school found jobs avoided welfare pregnancies and trouble with the law than children in a control group with no preschool education Studies by the HighScope Educational Research Foundation estimate that the program saved Ypsilanti some 3000 per child net largely because of a reduced need for various social services At the other end of the educational spectrum says David Birch an MIT social scientist the country should go all out to provide adult workers with greater access to job retraining Twenty precent of American workers change jobs every year now and because of technological change Mr Birch argues job mobility and instability will become even more pronounced in the coming decades  particularly among white collar workers in industries like insurance banking and finance The Democrats focus has been on job security and welfare and subsidies to industries rather than on training and education says Mr Birch some of whose ideas were picked up in Senator Gary Harts Presidential campaign We have to build power and knowledge and security in the individual not into particular jobs What the Democrats should do is try to come up with a whole new kind of security We have health and accident insurance old age and unemployment insurance What we need now is occupational insurance making it easier for people to learn new skills This he insists is the gut issue of the next 10 to 15 years and until the Democrats figure out how to deal with it theyre not going to get elected Implementing such ideas would require new efforts from policy makers efforts not suggested either by the antigovernment rhetoric of the Republicans or the paternal doitall government embraced by the old Democratic Party
REAGAN OPENS SECOND TERM WITH A VINTAGE PERFORMANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/weekinreview/reagan-opens-second-term-with-a-vintage-performance.html,WASHINGTON Of all the words of blessing on his second term none could have been sweeter to President Reagan than the grudging compliment he heard from Democratic House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr when they met in private In my 50 years of public life Ive never seen a man more popular than you are with the American people This concession and Mr ONeills corollary promise to stand aside and not block votes on the Presidents economic plans came from a politician whose standard of popularity was established in witnessing the legend of Franklin D Roosevelt Roosevelt has been claimed as a model by Mr Reagan too in his own Presidential style as distinct from policy There is no reason to think that this will change in the second term particularly as the President attempts a larger role on the world stage of arms control while continuing his assault on domestic spending Mr ONeill who did badly as the Reagan nemesis in the first term recounted his message to the President on the initial working day of the second term I said to him We can read You got 59 percent of the votes  The President needed no reminder as he made plans to go directly to the people to sell his budget and taxoverhaul proposals and as he set the opening theme for his new term presenting himself in his inaugural message as a proven leader His first piece of work was to gather his new arms control team and cite their success as his major goal Talks with the Soviet Union will begin March 12 in Geneva The renewed President did not blitz the electorate with an array of inaugural goals Rather he chose to underline the very quality that got him reelected his considerable self confidence in breasting the seas of history where he noted another predecessor Jefferson cautioned there lies some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us Mr Reagan loves to exhibit his optimism he again brandished a favorite line from the show business world that encouraged his early instinct to be the nations leading man You aint seen nothin yet he told a ballroom of inauguration dancers He vied with the bands message Gershwins  S Wonderful by crowing about the latest economic indicators As tired as the capital may soon become of once more celebrating the success and confidence of Mr Reagan few were complaining in these first days of the second term He was given his due even in the face of that rarest of occurences the breakdown of a Reagan media event in this case the inaugural parade Arctic winds swept into town purging the outdoors of hot air and people and leaving the parade route empty as moonscape while the marchers were kept inside in fear of frostbite Adaptation became the rage the poor huddling in charity shelters suddenly found sushi quiche and Westphalian ham as the evening handouts from lobbyists who had to scrap their parties Let history say of us these were golden years the President implored as he too adapted and delivered his Inaugural Address in the Rotunda of the Capitol He was gentle in tone but proud of his record saying that his new beginning policies of four years ago were vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth The President was hailing an American economy that in his reelection year had registered the strongest growth in three decades But under the opening agenda of his second term Mr Reagan also was obliged to admit that a time of reckoning had arrived for reducing deficit spending a problem that reached record 200billion levels in his first term Mr Reagan who already has retreated from his postelection vow to halve the deficit by 1988 again talked of needing a constitutional mandate to balance the budget a measure his advisers privately admit is unlikely ever to be enacted Power in the Rotunda While again uttering his hope for the total elimination of nuclear weapons from the earth he renewed his budget vow to oppose deep military defense trims depicting history as a struggle between totalitarian darkness and the warm sunlight of human freedom The rebuilding of the American arsenal is not complete he cautioned There must be no wavering by us The power of such words from one of the most popular Presidents in two centuries of American politics was not wasted on the Rotunda audience The new Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Bob Packwood of Oregon sounded just as cowed as Speaker ONeill on the subject of challenging Mr Reagan at the dawn of his second term At the moment Republicans have no heart in the Senate for a knockdown dragout with the President over defense Only a few weeks earlier Senate Republicans had been claiming greater resolve to resist the President Things shift quickly in Washington however where the pundits change their tunes as quickly as pit musicians The tendency to rush beyond the moment can be irresistible even on inaugural night Twelve more years one ballroom crowd shouted to Vice President Bush thinking of 88 and beyond The President showed no immediate tolerance for even happy lame duck fantasizing On Sunday he took to the national TV screen where his world is truly lit by lightning and flipped the Superbowl coin like an electronic Emperor on Monday he appeared again before the nation speaking with the hunger of a patriarch for the future By the standards of that screen the next real Presidential event for the capital will be the State of the Union message He filled out last week with some words but no picture piped from the White House to a large crowd in what has come to be his annual blessing of the cause of outlawing abortion The momentum is with us said the President to the crowd He also condemned violence against abortion clinics We cannot condone the threatening or taking of human life to protest the taking of human life by way of abortion Off the record aides admitted they again expect no major White House push for enactment of a ban by Congress These first few days then were devoted less to measuring the latest in Jeffersons ever crashing waves than to savoring Ronald Reagan the victor  S Awful nice the band music blared forth as the triumphant President arrived to dance at his second inaugural Mr Reagan already had spoken of a more haunting air imagining for the nation the wordless song of some long ago pioneer echoing forever as timeless inspiration It is the American sound he said It is hopeful big hearted idealistic  daring decent and fair Thats our heritage thats our song  AFTER presiding over a painful recession Ronald Reagan can now make a good case that his policies have been shown to be right on the money so to speak The record is the more remarkable in view of some things that havent happened For example Government has not been notably successful in curbing spending the main cause of the deficits The question is how long the combination of high growth and low inflation hailed by the President last week will continue Government demands for money to cover all that red ink could raise interest rates This would act as a brake on the economy and could cause a bad stumble And then there are concerns shared by many authorities about the boost inflation might get if the dollar falls sharply on the worlds currency markets
"NEW JERSEY OPINION;

REFLECTIONS ON ABORTION AND ETHICS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-reflections-on-abortion-and-ethics.html,I FEEL a vague uneasiness lately when I say that Im  prochoice on the abortion issue I didnt always feel this way Once I had no doubts being prochoice seemed like a reasonable rational opinion for an enlightened person Why bring unwanted children into the world Shouldnt a woman have control over her own body My uneasiness has been nurtured partly by the stories of people I know One friends daughter became pregnant several years ago She was in love with the childs father but not ready to make a committment She chose abortion  It was a painful experience for both mother and daughter and the daughter promised she would never get into such a situation again In less than a year however the promise was broken This time she had the baby but chose not to marry the father A college student I know rooms with a girl who became pregnant a year ago She too had an abortion My young friend was disturbed by the casual attitude of her roommate and of several other girls at school all of whom seemed to regard their abortions as trivial episodes Surely these young girls are not ready for babies But are they ready for responsible sex Shouldnt the intimacy of giving ones body to another involve values  In this day of womens struggle for respect in society why are young women allowing the most intimate act between two people to be valueless  If we can have sex without commitment and abort without blinking an eye what do we really think of ourselves What do we think of the next generation that lies within us Do we take the first fruit of that waiting generation and destroy it without conscience  Im concerned about population growth and about abused and hungry children and yet I cant reconcile in my mind the control of these problems with the elimination of life begun From all practical standpoints abortion staves off myriad problems But human beings are much more than practical beings We live not by instinct alone but by emotion conscience values and faith Every experience we have imprints on our minds and can be played back throughout a lifetime We need to be very careful about the things we choose to do that may haunt us later Perhaps it is the number of abortions in recent years that is making people like myself uneasy The reality of 4000 abortions a day is unsettling If so many women can find their way to abortion clinics why cant they find their way to Planned Parenthood centers The choices we make cannot be looked at only in terms of what is good or convenient for us as individuals but should be viewed in terms of what impact they may have on the rest of society How we live the way we speak the way we treat each other  all either enhance or diminish our community Our values are what determine our strength and the quality of our lives  Are we promoting a life of quality by freely utilizing this harshest method of birth control or are we diminishing our view of life by feeling comfortable sloughing off the invisible child What is done to the moral fiber of a society that accepts the interruption of life as a matter of convenience  If abortion is to remain a choice we should not abuse the freedom It should never be a decision arrived at easily without an understanding of what it really means Terminating a pregnancy is destroying life There are often unexpected aftereffects A young woman told me recently that she had had an abortion seven years ago while still in college It had been explained to her in a very clinical manner A simple procedure  in and out  and nothing to worry about Everyone she talked to made it sound so easy It wasnt until the woman was on her back on the cold stainlesssteel table and feeling life being sucked out of her that the reality of what was occurring washed over her She has lived with recurring bouts of depression ever since and is now actively prolife  Not all women experience such remorse but many do Some dont have regrets until they have their first child when the preciousness of life takes on new meaning There are many things to consider before going through with an abortion I think in terms of my own situation I was married at 20 and soon became pregnant We had planned to wait several years to have children so we could save our money and buy a house A child threatened to destroy our plans But that was 1964 and abortion never entered my mind Im grateful I didnt have a choice  I gave birth in December 1964 to a healthy boy  the only child I was able to conceive  Pregnancy occurred so quickly that we were certain we were a highly fertile couple Three couples we know had the same experience an easy conception in the first year of marriage and then never another There are many realities beyond the quick relief abortion can bring The events in our lives are rarely isolated and unconnected Everything we do becomes part of what we are We need to ask ourselves what kind of people we want to be and act accordingly We owe it to ourselves We owe it to our children born and unborn and we owe it to society    Joanne Bonwick

THAT'S HOW THE MONEY CHANGES HANDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/books/thats-how-the-money-changes-hands.html,BRIBES  By John T Noonan Jr 839 pp New York Macmillan Publishing Company 2995  One may look at American politics from the beginning of the Republic as a contest played and replayed in different keys and with variations between the people who command the votes and the people who command the money The people with the votes endlessly try to democratize the system to broaden the franchise and make it easier for their supporters to register and vote Those who command the money take the view that there is no morality in mere numbers and that our system involves a much more complicated series of checks and balances than the democrats believe  and that among these checks are those drawn on financial institutions Both sides in this debate may find some comfort in a remarkable book by John T Noonan Jr a professor of law at the University of California Berkeley The book is about far more than its title Bribes suggests It is about a concept as general as reciprocity and a problem as specific as political contributions It is about morals religious doctrine and literary criticism as well as a great deal of history Mr Noonan is not only a man of incredible erudition and one of the nations most distinguished moralists he is a fascinating storyteller as well Those who have read his previous works on usury and contraception will find the basic structure of this book familiar He begins with a document from ancient Mesopotamia apparently the first record of what we would call bribery The story involves the settling of accounts with a mayor who when bribed did not deliver as he had promised  From there Mr Noonan moves on to other  and for most readers equally little known  stories The case against Gaius Verres may be recalled by some who studied Ciceros prosecutorial orations in Latin class  but even those of us who attempted to disinter that language usually did not dig that deep Nor will many be familiar with the charges against Nestorius the Bishop of Constantinople on whose 1500yearold case Mr Noonan passes careful judgment And we probably know almost as little about the debates and equivocations that marked the long battle to rid the Roman Catholic Church of simony Even the name attached to this form of ecclesiastical bribery has an interesting history It goes back to the account in the Acts of the Apostles of the sin of Simon the Magician who offered Peter and John money for being taught the trick of infusing believers with the Holy Spirit Peter told him Thy money perish with thee Throughout the Middle Ages the church had considerable difficulty with the concept that each ecclesiastical appointment should be judged on its merits without intercession  after all the church was built on the teaching that on the Day of Judgment Jesus would be an advocate as well as a judge In addition lacking the power to tax the church needed a source of revenue for its many good works  very much as politicians to  John Kaplan  the Jackson Eli Reynolds Professor of Law at Stanford University is the author of The Hardest Drug Heroin and Public Policy day need campaign contributions Mr Noonan reports endless discussions about how choices should be made among equally worthy candidates and whether the payment of money is an appropriate way to break a tie  Some of his more recent stories we know in rough outline As Lord Chancellor of England in the 16th century Francis Bacon was a prodigious taker of bribes  whether or not he was the author of Shakespeares plays In the Yazoo case of 1795 speculators bribed the Georgia Legislature to sell them 35 million acres of land at a ridiculously low price The act was annulled the following year but the Federal Government eventually settled claims in favor of the speculators or those to whom they had passed on their investment At about the same time in England Warren Hastings the Governor General of Bengal was subjected to a sevenyear trial for bribery giving his prosecutor Edmund Burke an opportunity for some of his finest rhetoric in what turned out to be a losing cause In the mid 19th century in this country the Credit Mobilier scandal involved the placing of shares of railroad stock with congressmen and reached the highest levels of the United States Government short only of the President himself Judge Martin Manton of the illustrious United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was convicted of taking bribes in one of a number of judicial scandals between the world wars Another of those involved a senior partner in one of the most prestigious law firms in the nation Indeed the law firm  Cravath Swain  Moore  still retains in its name that of Hoyt A Moore who must have known of and approved bribes paid by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation to a Federal District Court judge The indictment against him was dismissed on statuteoflimitation grounds  hardly a resounding vindication IN each of these cases Mr Noonan gives us in relatively short compass an authoritative and balanced review of the facts soberly judges credibility and guilt and places each event in the social context of its time But if the history illustrating the gradual development of a moral consensus on bribery takes up a great part of the book they are by no means Mr Noonans whole interest He is concerned with presentday politics as well and focuses our attention on a remarkable recent development in American history  the Federal Governments move beginning in the 1960s to punish acts of corruption by local officials With Abscam fresh in our minds it is very difficult for us to remember that until the middle of this century very few Americans exposed as bribe givers or takers were criminally convicted  Mr Noonan not only discusses the magnitude of this almost unnoticed development and the changes in legal doctrine that allowed it to occur but speculates on why it has happened He isolates three factors The first was the Vietnam War Those opposed to our intervention argued that we were propping up a corrupt government and constantly compared the high moral standards of the Communist cadres to the corruption of their capitalist opponents Even hawks were forced to admit that by our standards the South Vietnamese Government was corrupt but they argued that the officials we supported were the best alternative to something far worse We will debate that issue for some time to come but the significance of governmental corruption became obvious to everyone as a result THE concern with bribery also arose out of another conflict  Mr Noonan calls it the struggle between the center the hierarchical forces of order and the border the sectarian forces critical of authority The anthropologist Mary Douglas and the political scientist Aaron Wildavsky have used these concepts in Risk and Culture their study of environmental law and politics Others have seen the same dichotomy as being between nativist or bedrock Americans and cosmopolitans In any event anyone who looks at contemporary America can see a contest for the soul of the nation being waged on literally dozens of fronts  school prayer gun control marijuana abortion pornography nuclear energy and foreign policy to name a few  Bedrock Americas views on law and order divide citi zens into criminals and good people Indeed one difference between nativists and cosmopolitans is the formers belief in black andwhite dichotomies among people as opposed to the latters view that we fall along a continuum of shades of gray President Reagans remark while Governor of California that those involved in the Watergate coverup were not real criminals shows which position he takes At any rate a bribery prosecution is a perfect weapon for the cosmopolitan or sectarian attack As a whitecollar crime bribery demonstrates that good people can still commit crimes and prosecuting it helps the attack on authority by denigrating those who wield it  this even though we witnessed from perhaps the end of the McCarthy period to the middle of the Carter Presidency a constant growth in the power of the cosmopolitans in our legislatures and bureaucracies The third source of our concern with bribery is largely hypothetical Throughout his book Mr Noonan emphasizes the sexual nature of the vocabulary used to describe bribery  prostitution of ones office for instance He argues that the decline of puritanism in the United States and the lessened importance of chastity have caused an emphasis on governmental purity As he puts it Officials were now to bear the burden of purity Relieved of responsibility the electorate could indulge itself  Though Bribery is studded with such insights as well as much information Mr Noonan has not written the last word on the subject He implies for example that Abraham Lincoln was guilty of dangling inducements before those congressmen whose votes he needed to secure the passage of the 13th Amendment This view ignores the complexity of the restraints on relations among officeholders Logrolling goes on all the time Indeed some defend it as a means of reflecting the strength of preference of individuals and groups as well as their numbers Many would regard reciprocity related to a single issue as compromise The concept that all reciprocity not directly related to a single issue therefore becomes bribery is clearly too extreme  but perhaps we can develop standards short of the anything goes variety Furthermore Mr Noonan does not pay enough attention to the difference between bribery and extortion In law extortion as a first approximation occurs when the officeholder initiates the transaction and the payer has a right to the official action for which he is forced to pay In practice it is sometimes difficult to tell bribery from extortion In either case of course the officeholder is guilty of a criminal offense But the payer of money is guilty only in the case of bribery and the fact of the matter is that throughout history the private citizens only remedy against governmental oppression has sometimes been to pay someone off To say that we should begin our fight by punishing the person who initiates governmental corruption in an attempt to resist governmental oppression is asking a great deal And the matter is complicated by the fact that the processes designed to cope with extortion without causing irreparable injury to the victim are often not sufficiently reliable and speedy Mr Noonan is undoubtedly right that the many arguments that excused or trivialized bribery are gradually yielding Whether this will in the long run produce a lessening in the practice is quite a different matter The Government must take steps that will have a powerful impact on individuals and groups Cases must be judged crimes must be investigated But as we denounce and attempt to fight bribery through increased bureaucratization supervision and regulation of conflicts of interest we increase the pressures toward bribery by providing more favors for the Government to pass out and more penalties for it to exact Until recently only a few selected industries were subject to major governmental regulation Today businesses across the board must satisfy Government officials that they are maintaining their workers safety are not discriminating and are minimizing damage to the environment  In areas such as building codes and zoning we enact rules so the citizenry can be confident the Government is protecting it to the highest possible degree But everybody directly involved knows that individuals and businesses cannot live up to the legal standards thus set Such a situation gives the officials in charge of enforcing laws the ability to bestow favors Sometimes they will do so without recompense but as their largesse gains in value the temptations will grow And so long as we do not take our own legislation on offenses such as gambling and marijuana use seriously the police will have great incentives to do well by doing good   One of the aspects of bribery least appreciated by observers is how easily a public official such as a policeman can slide into a relationship involving bribery Should we prevent a policeman from accepting anything in the way of a gift from a civilian We certainly do not forbid this to mailmen  or if we do we do not take the prohibition seriously The coffeeshop owner who offers a policeman free coffee feels he is doing his duty as a citizen and expressing his appreciation for services performed For his own enterprises security he also likes the idea of having policemen drop in From free coffee  against which an administrator will find it hard to complain credibly  we go to free meals to a bottle of liquor for Christmas to two tickets to a baseball game and then to money presents What policeman in this relationship will enforce the law when the merchant illegally doubleparks for a few minutes to unload cases of beer THEN there is the problem of political contributions Money in itself is not always bad It is not at all clear that we should distinguish between those who work for a candidate by handing out leaflets and those who give money to hire people for this purpose It is however important to distinguish between those who give money to a candidate whose views they support and those who give money with the understanding that the candidate will adopt their views The latter Mr Noonan emphasizes is bribery and is wrong However since political campaigns show no sign of becoming less expensive the next generation of thinkers will have to continue Mr Noonans work They will need either to convince us that a simple solution is best or more likely to devise a compromise that will allow us to live more easily with the ambiguities of the reciprocity relationB
U.S. PRELATES SURPRISED BUT PLEASED OVER SYNOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/world/us-prelates-surprised-but-pleased-over-synod.html,American Cardinals Bishops and theologians said yesterday that they were stunned by Pope John Paul IIs announcement that he is calling an extraordinary synod of bishops to examine the results of the Second Vatican Council which ended 20 years ago But they welcomed the synod as an opportunity for bishops to discuss developments since Vatican II directly with the Pope It seems that the bishops didnt know about it said William Ryan associate public affairs secretary for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington DC It was a big surprise The Pope made the announcement Friday and said the synod to be held in Rome from Nov 25 to Dec 8 would seek to relive in some way that extraordinary atmosphere of ecclesiastical communion that characterized Vatican II Pope John Paul has always praised Vatican II which ushered in sweeping changes both in the way the church saw its mission in the modern world and in church practices It introduced liturgical changes such as the saying of mass in the vernacular and more active participation of the laity and placed a new emphasis on ecumenism and on religious liberty Basic Doctrines Stressed But as early as his first sermon as Pope in 1978 John Paul has expressed concern that loyalty to Vatican II not affect loyalty to the basic doctrines of the church Bishop James W Malone of Youngstown Ohio who as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops will attend the synod learned of the synod only on Friday when he arrived in Montreal from Havana where he had been visiting at the invitation of Cuban bishops The synod will give bishops an opportunity to work in a special way with the Holy Father to apply the insights and wisdom of Vatican II to present day problems confronting the church Bishop Malone said yesterday through a spokesman I look forward to preparing for the synod and to contributing to it to the best of my ability Not even Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago the only American on the Vatican advisory council for synods knew about the Popes decision in advance but he too praised it From my experience of past synods I know that this meeting will provide a unique instrument for reviewing evaluating and furthering the goals of the Council Cardinal Bernardin said in a statement through a spokesman The synod is another moment for renewal Some Reluctant to Speculate Some church leaders and theologians seemed reluctant to speculate on what would be on the synods agenda According to canon law a special synod is called to deal with matters that require an immediate solution But the Pope did not announce what those matters might be Will the synod deal with broad doctrinal issues that have been unresolved since Vatican II asked the Rev Donald R Campion spiritual director of Jesuit scholastics at Fordham University who reported on Vatican II for the Jesuit magazine America Or will it limit itself to discussing the nittygritty of Vatican II such as clerical garb marriage laws the liturgy All these issues require a lot of preparation and debate and there is no speedy solution Brooklyn Archbishop Comments Archbishop Francis J Mugavero of Brooklyn hospitalized for treatment of an infection said through a spokesman The synod will enable the church to apply the doctrinal and ecclesiastical wealth of Vatican II to the serious issues that have arisen over the pasty 20 years in our rapidly developing world issues such as nuclear war the decline in the number of priests and religious and ethical questions of divorce abortion death and dying There was no agreement on whether the Pope would use the synod as a means to reinforce church discipline Archbishop John J OConnor of New York said Friday that he believed the call for the synod reflected concern that Vatican II has been misinterpreted and perhaps misused He said many Catholics no longer go to mass or to confession out of a mistaken interpretation of the Councils work But Archbishop John R Roach of St PaulMinneapolis former head of the Conference of Bishops stressed through a spokesman that any speculation that this is an effort to tighten discipline would seem to be premature What most surprised some leaders of the American church is the short notice they have to prepare for the synod Preparations for an ordinary synod generally held every three years begin as soon as the previous one ends and involve complicated drafting and revisions of working documents and lengthy consultations Even deciding the agenda for a synod is a monumental task Some church leaders also questioned privately just how much the synod can accomplish in a twoweek period The last synod held in 1983 lasted four weeks A synod the highest form of consultation in the church is an advisory body and its recommendations can be overruled by a Pope There has been only one other extraordinary synod In 1969 Pope Paul VI called one that opened the door to wider participation of the bishops with the Pope in governing the church
THE WHOLE FEMINIST CATALOGUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/books/the-whole-feminist-catalogue.html,Andrew Hacker teaches political science at Queens College His most recent book is US A Statistical Portrait of the American People SISTERHOOD IS GLOBAL The International Womens Movement Anthology Edited and introduced by Robin Morgan 815 pp New York Anchor PressDoubleday 2495 The typical Soviet woman has at least a dozen abortions during her childbearing years while in Canada one woman in five will be sexually assaulted Precisely 1336 percent of all Nepalese girls between 10 and 14 are already married One city in India recorded 394 cases of brides burned to death in 198081 mainly by husbands coveting a second dowry These are just some of the facts and figures in Sisterhood Is Global a sometimes grim but always fascinating compendium on the worldwide condition of women The contributions cover some 70 countries from Afghanistan to Zambia For each nation we are given a statistical preface followed by an original essay by one of the countrys leading feminists While the gathering of facts presented here is impressive the reader should be warned the book abounds with emotions and opinions and has little of the style of a standard reference work And despite its stress on statistics accuracy is not its strongest suit In fairness one should concede the essays make no claim to objectivity Most take the form of letters offering impressions on how women are faring on the writers home ground The editor Robin Morgan chose the contributors and then gave them a free rein In one sense this is a limitation what we hear about each of the countries reflects a single point of view However when added together the book presents an array  and disarray  of views on where women stand and what steps they should be taking to improve their lot For the Dutch contributor the major issue is Do we still make love with our oppressor The problems are rather different in Haiti where teenage girls stitch baseballs for 14 cents an hour Elsewhere the titles tell much of the story Women in a Warrior Society Australia Fighting for the Right to Fight Colombia Elegance Amid the Phallocracy Senegal From Copenhagen the writer wonders if given all the options she has she can honestly contend that something is really rotten in the state of Denmark A colleague in Cairo apologizes for the delay in completing her contribution caused by an 80day sentence for stirring up sectarian strife Not all are critical From Saudi Arabia and Poland we hear surprisingly positive prognoses by authors with important academic posts On the other hand almost a dozen of the essays are by exiles or residents who find it prudent to remain anonymous Some devote their space to poetry West Germany or parables Morocco Margaret Papandreou the wife of Greeces Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou provides a delightful vignette of Village Sisterhood in Greece Only a handful are really dull New Zealand women are without liberty we are the chattels the property of men This is true unfortunately of the piece on the United States which consists largely of slogans If men got pregnant abortion would become a sacrament The entry from Ireland is hilarious Nell McCafferty relates the saga of the Pill Train the only gesture of a united womens movement in Ireland Belfast may be under colonial rule but at least contraceptives are available in the North Hence a publicized train ride to obtain packets of pills to brandish back in Dublin Pharmacists in the North were friendly but said prescriptions were required They offered condoms instead not quite the same thing One of the most rewarding if unintended features of Sisterhood Is Global is the ideological debate implicit in its pages By temperament the editor and almost all the contributors veer toward the left Yet as Simone de Beauvoir points out in her essay on France if that side of the spectrum has been the chosen friend of militant women it has also been their worst enemy An ally because the left calls for rebuilding society which would presumably end barriers based on gender But an enemy because virtually every leftleaning regime has put womens issues on the back burner or ignored them altogether This tension becomes vivid with the articles on the Marxist orbit Thus the essay on the Soviet Union by a samizdat editor now exiled in Paris tells of alcoholic husbands abortions without anesthetics and KGB harrassment of women who protest brutal conditions A bitter report on Cuba also by an emigre says that women who backed the revolution feel betrayed The real transformation never took place And it will not take place so long as bearded men cling to power However the Chinese contributor a professor writing under a pseudonym does not seem overly perturbed that her country does not allow an independent womens movement to exist She applauds the onechildperfamily policy since it will enable women to vie for more responsible positions Communiques from other Marxist capitals are even more sanguine From Managua we hear that the massive participation of Nicaraguan women their sacrifice and heroism made possible our national liberation Similarly the report from Hanoi tells us that the women of Vietnam have energetically devoted themselves to the establishment and defense of the revolutionary power Needless to say both writers hold official positions While Robin Morgan tells us that the women in Sisterhood Is Global share a feminist vision of transforming the world her book reveals their ambiguities Simone de Beauvoir is frank to say that the rift between socialist feminists and radical feminists cannot be papered over In politics as elsewhere those who see betrayal by men as the inevitable outcome counsel going it alone Others stick with movements led by men because that is where the real power resides But there remains the issue of accuracy With the essays the question is less apt to arise we expect emphasis and exaggeration in personal communications However when it comes to figures more rigorous standards apply The statistical prefaces were prepared by researchers and interns connected with the project and the editor assures us that every item was put through a crucible of care After checking the longest section  the one on the United States  I feel obliged to aver that care is not enough The problem is not that figures were miscopied from documentary sources In some cases it is clear that the researchers did not know how to read the tables Hence the errors in computing womenss earnings relative to mens and in classifying the types of daycare arrangements made by working mothers Elsewhere suspicioussounding numbers were not checked against more substantial sources This apparently accounts for inflated infant mortality rates the undercount of men on welfare rolls and errors in findings on postdivorce income The simple failure to distinguish families from households yields a huge overcount of unmarried couples ANOTHER tendency is to report the findings of various studies without asking how the figures were obtained Thus we are told that as many as nine women out of 10 have suffered sexual harassment on the job while seven wives in 10 experience battery while married Perhaps But tell us what definitions were used And what are we to make of the claim that in the United States a woman is raped every three seconds which counts out to some 10 million rapes annually a thousand times the official count Similarly if 12 million children aged 15 or under are involved in prostitution or pornography every year it means one child in 50 undergoes these serious abuses Such statistical assertions must be made more persuasive especially when specific sources are not given Nor will it do to cite a single survey when a variety are available The results of studies of contraceptive methods for example vary by as much as 50 percent depending on sampling and reporting of responses I agree with the editors that most statistics currently in use have an androcentric bias They are based on categories created by men with little recognition of the lives women lead Still working with numbers requires knowing the nuances and not all the ground rules are readily selftaught As it happens some of our top statisticians are women I am sure had they been asked Janet Norwood at the Bureau of Labor Statistics or Arlene Saluter of the Census would have been pleased to go over one or more of the sections That they werent suggests that the compilers of Sisterhood Is Global view women who succeed in a mens world as themselves suspect While the book lists the nations where women have served as head of state these women are not cited as role models Too professional a tone may signify one has succumbed to the patriarchical mentality wherein as Robin Morgan puts it the standard for being human is being male Insofar as this is so the womens movement wants more than fairer access to opportunities and power It is asking that we reconsider our most basic presumptions about how we analyze the worldB APARTHEID AN PRIORITIES When I was growing up I got a lot of encouragement from women Women are so resourceful all over the world They are the ones who keep the family together who augment salaries who absorb and tolerate pain and suffering and humiliation Im not saying absorbing pain is the answer the ideal But it is an inspiration Women have always resisted injustice Even in our own ancestral heritage women played very prominent roles To this day outside Pretoria in an area called Hammamskraal there is an African woman Esther Kekana who is a chieftain in her own right over men and women Almost all of our chiefs  male and female  got their position by heredity because they were of royal blood but the South African government appointed chieftains themselves    The impact of apartheid on all our lives creates pressures to relegate womens issues to a remote priority But I strongly believe that feminist issues must be dealt with concurrently  as a major area of injustice because after the political struggles are over the women tend to be forgotten  From Sisterhood Is Global
THE RIGHT-TO-LIFE DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/magazine/l-the-right-to-life-debate-238346.html,I find it curious that A Lawrence Washburn Jr and others in the righttolife camp are pushing so hard to take away parents rights in decisions regarding the care of newborn children while insisting that all young women even those who may be victims of incest be required to obtain parental consent for abortion It would seem more logical that parents of infants who need so much parental care should have the right to make the decisions regarding such care while parents of emancipated minors should have less say in their medical decisions It looks to me as if the issue here is one of control over other peoples lives and a desire to inflict suffering on others  for their own good of course This is not my understanding of Christianity THE REV BEATRICE BLAIR New York City

"POPE, ON VENEZUELA TOUR, SAYS MASS BEFORE A MILLION",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/28/world/pope-on-venezuela-tour-says-mass-before-a-million.html,Pope John Paul II continued his tour of Venezuela today by saying masses before over a million people here and in Caracas The Popes pilgrimage came as Roman Catholics around the world considered the potentially farreaching import of his call for a synod this year to reexamine the results of the Second Vatican Council of 196265 The Pope used his sermon in Caracas to issue a strong condemnation of contraception sterilization divorce abortion and euthanasia Contraception and sterilization he said were always seriously illicit Remember this he went on it is never licit to end a human life with abortion and euthanasia Nicaraguan Bishop Attends On the plane from Caracas a Vatican spokesman announced that Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua Nicaragua had come to Maracaibo and would attend the mass with the Pope The Archbishop is expected to meet with the Pope and discuss the difficulties the church faces in leftistgoverned Nicaragua Archbishop Obando y Bravo was one of several Central and South American prelates who came here tonight to dine with the Pope The others included Arturo Rivera y Damas the Archbishop of San Salvador and high church leaders from Columbia and Curacao In his greetings at the mass tonight the Pope called attention to the situation in Central America sending his greetings to those who come from Columbia Honduras the Antilles and with special affection I send my embrace of peace for the situation in which the churches of El Salvador and Nicaragua find themselves and to their pastors who are here On his arrival in Maracaibo center of Venezuelas oil business the Pope was greeted by a marching band and a throng of little girls in red and yellow dresses The girls mobbed the Pope throwing their arms around him and winning kisses and pats on the head The Popes remarks throughout the day underscored the firmness of the message he has brought to South America on a journey that began with a chastisement of dissident theologians and a call on bishops to correct errors by priests and theologians The Pope however insisted that firmness should not be confused with a view of the coming synod as an effort to overturn the changes brought about by Vatican II Rather he said its purpose was to see that they were applied properly and fruitfully to the new situation in which the church finds itself Aims to Resolve Confusion The Vatican newspaper LOsservatore Romano said on Saturday that the synods purpose was to resolve confusion that has arisen over Vatican II in the 20 years since it ended Church officials traveling with the Pope have stressed over the last two days that he was one of the main figures in Vatican II and is deeply committed to its ideas and purposes But they have also noted that liberal and conservative elements in the church have differed sharply over how Vatican IIs sweeping changes should be interpreted For conservatives who accepted Vatican IIs work one of its main purposes was to adapt the church to the modern world to make it easier to spread the Roman Catholic message The Pope made this point in Caracas on Saturday arguing that the Council specifies that the divorce between faith and daily living is one of the most serious errors of our time Achieving a practical reactivation that would overcome this incoherence is a colossal task to which you must direct your pastoral work he told Venezuelas bishops Is Councils Work Concluded This viewpoint Catholic leaders and theologians have argued essentially views Vatican IIs work as successfully concluded The main task now is to make sure that its teachings are applied properly according to this view More liberal Catholics however argue that Vatican II opened up a radically new era of internal freedom in the church These Catholics see it as ushering in not only specific changes but also a continuing process of internal debate and selfexamination The broader questions raised by the synod however have to do with changes that went on outside the church some of which will be brought home during the Popes trip here In the developed countries these included changes in attitudes toward the role of women sexual values and marriage Even in Venezuela a country where many people became better off because of oil wealth Catholic leaders express worry about the rise in materialism and the decline in church attendance and in other measures of fealty Few Catholics Attend Mass In a country that is nominally 94 percent Catholic as few as 5 to 10 percent of Venezuelan Catholics attend mass every Sunday And Government and church officials estimate that as many as half the countrys children are born out of wedlock In the developing countries particularly here in Latin America there has been a growth of leftwing revolutionary movements Some of these drew sympathy from certain church leaders notably the advocates of the theology of liberation which advocates political action to transform society On Saturday in an obvious reference to Marxism the Pope spoke of the danger of ideologies which promise an illusory earthly liberation The Pope himself said Saturday that a reevaluation of Vatican IIs results was necessary since change was inevitable over 20 years It would he said be a bit curious if it had not happened At his mass today in Caracas attended by an enthusiastic crowd estimated at up to one million the Pope witnessed some of those changes Among those distributing communion were nuns something that would not have been seen in a Catholic service let alone a papal mass two decades ago Consultation Stressed Both the Pope and Agostino Cardinal Casaroli the Vatican Secretary of State sought to picture the synod as a way of consulting with bishops on what the Cardinal called their diagnoses of the churchs current situaiton Their comments as well as those of some American bishops tended to play down the view that the synod would result in a call for greater discipline But the Pope so far during his South American visit has made it clear that he intends to see to it that official church teaching is taken seriously In a sermon at mass here tonight the Pope said Catholic teachers should receive the faith with humble obedience and transmit it faithfully And just before he left Caracas today he made clear to an ecumenical group just how important church belief is Doctrine is not only a piece of paper he said but also an expression of faith and an inspiration of spirit and a law to follow
ABORTION CLINIC PIONEER FEARS DEFEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/29/nyregion/abortion-clinic-pioneer-fears-defeat.html,Risking arrest and jail Bill Baird opened the countrys first abortion clinic here 20 years ago I thought I was the candle that would light the darkness he recalled shaking his head I thought it would take the nation out of the Middle Ages Mr Baird now says he was foolishly optimistic But in many ways the clinics opening did mark the emergence of abortion  until then largely an unmentionable family disgrace  as an issue for national debate It also set the stage for him to become a national figure who has been alternately reviled and admired The clinic was soon performing abortions on dozens of women Many were teenagers who had never spent a night away from home others were too poor to pay for their operation still others were prominent local residents When Mr Baird opened his clinic abortion was illegal and abortionists could get 10year prison terms But the clinic was never raided Court Legalizes Clinics The tone of the abortion discussion was less strident then Mr Baird said The main issue was whether a woman could be forced to go through with a pregnancy Then 12 years ago the Supreme Court ruled in effect that abortion was a matter between a woman and her doctor Clinics quickly opened in cities across the country With no fanfare bulldozers last month tore down the original Hempstead clinic to make way for a courthouse For Mr Baird the clinics demise was at least as symbolic as its opening  a new stage in the 20year crusade that has consumed his life and provoked an anguished national debate Were witnessing the death of the abortion law he said It will be gone in two years unless the American people wake up and fight for their rights People call up and say Im behind you But theyre so far behind me that I cant see them Despite pleas from his wife and children to retreat from the limelight he remains unwilling to compromise The owner of three abortion and birthcontrol clinics he is a maverick who sends his natural allies into spasms of anger nearly as often as his natural enemies Still Planting Ideas Death threats  against him and his family  are a constant part of his life he said In recent years his Hempstead clinic was firebombed He has been shot at beaten up and spat upon He has also been arrested and jailed  eight times by his count Fiftytwo years old he says he is scared scarred and weary But he remains driven a workaholic He rushes from city to city talk show to picket line lecture to strategy session I call myself Johnny Appleseed he said recently while driving back from Boston where he had been a guest on a radio talk show I run around the country planting ideas and hoping theyll sprout into freedom and liberation When discussing anything besides abortion and birth control he is soft spoken and elfishlooking But that calm vanishes when the issue is abortion and birth control He becomes intense and didactic a zealot who sees the world as a battleground between good and evil Im trying to wake people up Mr Baird said His agressiveness he said is the adult form of a selfdefense trick he learned as a child growing up on the streets of Queens An Aggressive Childhood I always fought he recalled The kids would make fun of me because my clothes came from the Salvation Army I learned very early that if you punched them in the nose they would stop Mr Baird now forswears violence Opponents have frequently taken swings at him he said and he has taken them to court Indeed it is the courts that transformed Mr Baird from a clinic owner into a national figure Convicted of giving an unmarried women a birth control device during a 1967 speech  a violation of Massachusetts Crimes Against Chastity Law  he was sentenced to three months in jail Many feminist leaders and civilrights groups denounced his tactics as too militant and declined to support his appeal But in March 1972 the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction struck down similar birthcontrol laws in 26 states and set the legal stage for the landmark abortion decision If the right to privacy means anything Justice William Brennan wrote in the majority opinion it is the right of the individual married or single to be free from unwarranted Government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child Cited by Supreme Court In the Supreme Courts abortion decision Roe v Wade on Jan 23 1973 the Baird case was cited six times While most feminists celebrated that day Mr Baird warned that the Roman Catholic Church would start a drive to reverse the decision through a constitutional amendment Mr Baird said he was committed to continuing the fight He traced his involvement to the point when he had to drop out of medical school for financial reasons While in a hospital on a business call for his employer a national pharmaceutical company he saw a woman die from a selfinduced abortion He said he decided to challenge the laws that denied women the right to have an abortion Antiabortion activists compare him to Hitler and call him a murderer and the devil But such criticism seems to fortify him It is the barbs from his natural allies that sting him Although few feminists challenge his contributions to the battle many impugn his motives and question his tactics Knight in Shining Armor Betty Friedan the feminist author for instance charged in an interview last week that Mr Baird was driven by a desire to play the knight in shining armor rescuing the meek woman She called him egotistical counterproductive and disruptive When told of her comments Mr Baird appeared crushed I wouldnt trust this movement to the Betty Friedans of the world he said Feminists he added too often are sexists resentful that a man has led their battle But Mr Baird acknowledged that his ego was unnaturally large It is a necessary fault he said a shield that insulates him from personal attacks If I have to live with being called the devil evil a murderer Hitler then I have to speak up for myself to live with myself he said Im tired of being hated
"VATICAN SYNOD: TIMING DRAMATIC, INTENT UNCLEAR",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/29/world/vatican-synod-timing-dramatic-intent-unclear.html,Pope John Paul IIs unexpected call for a special synod to consider the results of the Second Vatican Council has presented Roman Catholics with an unusual somewhat puzzling set of possibilities John Pauls announcement last Friday on the 26th anniversary of the summoning of the Council by Pope John XXIII stated little more than the Popes desire to set aside two weeks to ponder the changes brought about by the Council At the least the timing of the synod  it is to end on the 20th anniversary of the close of Vatican II  is seen as an expression of the Popes sense of drama and occasion Given the vague description of the synod Catholics across the theological spectrum reacted with reserve Many see it as a potentially valuable review of the Councils work but too brief a session to entail further change Opening to the Modern Age The Vatican Council in the metaphor drawn by John XXIII was to open the windows of the church to the modern age It began in 1962 and ended in 1965 On hearing the call for such a Council few Catholics paid much attention Even most church leaders had little notion of what it would entail or how sweepingly its pronouncements would touch the lives of lay Catholics In the process liturgy was revamped the legitimacy of individual conscience was underscored and theological exploration of timehonored beliefs and practices was encouraged Embodied in the basic Council documents was a concept of the church that gave greater significance to the laity and urged Catholics to pursue justice and human rights with new ardor While affirming traditional Catholic teachings and the authority of the church hierarchy the Council taught that this power should be shared by the Pope with the bishops and to a limited extent with lay Catholics Though this process was clearly intended to be advisory it was considered a modest move to moderate hierarchical power The sketchy details and short duration of the special synod scheduled Nov 25 to Dec 8 appear to rule out any equivalent of the Council Those who have closely watched the Pope indicate that he may want to combine a commemoration of the Council with a firm repetition of his strict constructionist interpretation of its principal teachings But there are also hopes that the event can renew the vitality stirred by the Council Too Early to Be Certain Its too early to do much else than hazard guesses said the Rev Walter Burghardt a Jesuit theologian at Georgetown University Perhaps it would be interesting if an attempt is really made to analyze what has been happening since Vatican II  what the Council tried to do and to what extent it succeeded The Popes doctrinal conservatism has become so well defined that few Catholics expect the synod to become a mandate for further review of church teachings But at the same time John Pauls allegiance to the letter of Vatican II law is rarely questioned If anybody thinks this is some kind of disavowal of the Council this is an interpretation I would regard as certainly wrong said the Rev Avery Dulles a Jesuit theologian at the Catholic University of America whose book Models of the Church analyzes how various Catholics would like to see the church structured There is a certain amount of disaffection with the Council from the extreme right and left I dont think the Pope identifies with either of them Beyond that speculation the Popes action reinforced many aspects of his style of leadership centered in the authority of the Pope and his fellow bishops His reassertion of a strong papacy is not at odds with Vatican II but some say he sometimes falls short of the spirit of collegiality that became a hallmark of the Councils vision of how authority should be exercised One feature of the synod that reflects the Popes style is that it will bring bishops to Rome for an exchange of views He takes an active part in the triennial Synod of Bishops a monthlong discussion of major topics that have included the family and penance and he regularly invites bishops who are visiting Rome to share meals and extended conversation with him He has a reputation as an attentive listener who draws out his guests views with perceptive questions Expression of Concern He has sometimes used these sessions to make bishops aware of his concern at what he considers deviations from church dogma or morality He did so for example during visits by American bishops in 1983 expressing his displeasure with the widespread dissent among American Catholics over such teachings as the churchs ban on artificial birth control This pattern has stirred criticism largely on two points Some Catholics contend the Pope pays too much attention to the top rungs of church power Some assert that in stressing the need for conformity the Pope has embarked on a futile quest to constrict a healthy pluralism The critics say the Pope is profoundly distressed by the tendency by Catholics in Western democratic societies to exercise their sense of free conscience within the church Dissidents have been increasingly taken to task directly by the Vatican in a manner that sometimes irritates local bishops An example was the recent threat to expel 24 American nuns who had signed a statement contending that abortion can be a correct moral choice American bishops to the indignation of some were bypassed when the Sacred Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes moved against the nuns John Paul has repeatedly voiced his alarm over what he considers the license taken by many Catholics with regard to the Vatican Councils spirit of renewal and openness He has decried theologians who in his view have gone too far and he has appealed to disaffected Catholics to submit to church discipline But those who consult with him say he understands the contemporary limits on papal power Instilling discipline has become mostly a matter of persuasion rather than fiat Some Catholics say the synod will afford the Pope an extraordinary chance to restate his view of the Vatican Councils lessons But there is thus far little basis for assuming that the moment will reverse major trends stemming from the varying interpretations of the Council If youre going to change peoples minds said Father Dulles you probably cant do it in 13 days
"AT CONFERENCE, CONCERN ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/31/garden/at-conference-concern-about-abortion-rights.html,A year ago we had every reason to feel optimistic and we did  the prochoice movement had a powerful base the right tolife movements clout had diminished Shirley Gordon executive director of Family Planning Advocates of New York State told members of the organization at its eighth annual legislative conference here But who could foresee she asked that abortion would be a major factor in the election who could foresee that Archbishop John J OConnor would intrude himself into the campaign who could foresee that we would have bombing of clinics all over the country Last year we were on the offensive This year we are on the defensive An estimated 1000 activists gathered Monday and Tuesday for the meeting at the Nelson A Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Convention Center here Mrs Gordons assessment largely reflected the feeling of most participants about the status of the movement to preserve in the face of opposition a womans right to abortion The opposition comes from among others the President who has consistently opposed abortion and from the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church An additional concern is recent actions by extremists who have planted bombs at clinic sites Participants from across the state discussed how they might counteract antiabortion efforts such as The Silent Scream a film purporting to show a fetus recoiling from the instruments of abortion They debated how to respond to the Catholic Church and what if anything they might do about possible appointment to the United States Supreme Court of justices who oppose abortion For two days the participants lobbied state assemblymen and senators and they listened to such speakers as Representatives Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado Bill Green Republican of Manhattan and Karen S Burstein president of the New York State Civil Service Commission They were also addressed by such figures in the reproductiverights movement as Rhonda Copelan the lawyer who had successfully argued the case for Medicaid financing of abortions a decision later struck down by the Supreme Court and Frances Kissling executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice A theme repeated during the conference was that abortions would continue no matter how successful opponents are As Alfred F Moran executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City put it The debate is over whether it will be legal and safe or illegal and dangerous The conference blended frustration and pessimism with determination to find new responses to the problem  as Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink described it  of issues believed long gone reemerging Abortionrights activists said they were no longer sure what strategies to use against the opposition People have been asking us what we are doing said Esther Lewis chairman of the legislativeaction committee of the Family Planning Advocates And I say how can we talk to the opposition when what is happening in the clinics is terrorism We must do something but we dont know what The bombings have been disavowed by the leaders of the antiabortion forces and by the President Polly Rothstein director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion said There is among us a renewed feeling of anxiety We are no longer talking about losing single parts of the right to legal abortion such as Medicaid funding but losing abortion altogether A major focus of the conference was action in the state and participants were buoyed by the fact that New York has been steadfast in preserving rights and access to abortion exemplified by its continuation of Medicaid funding Warren M Anderson of Binghamton the Republican majority leader of the State Senate and Speaker Fink a Brooklyn Democrat both addressed the conference and a number of senators and assemblymen including some opponents of abortion rights attended a cocktail party Senator Mary B Goodhue a Republican of Mount Kisco said Of course abortion is always in jeopardy but the scenario is going to come out the same as it always does We will not lose anything The same level of confidence did not exist in discussions of Federal action particularly in regard to filling future vacancies expected on the United States Supreme Court Five justices are now over the age of 75 For abortionrights advocates one of the gloomier prognoses was offered by Lyle Denniston who writes about the Supreme Court for The Baltimore Sun Mr Denniston was a member of a panel on The Supreme Court Whats Ahead for Reproductive Rights Your position is now more vulnerable than at any point in the past 12 years Mr Denniston said There may be four to six vacancies on the Supreme Court and it would only take one to make a difference in reproductive rights In discussing the future for the Roe v Wade decision the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide Mr Denniston pointed out that the court has the power to reverse itself He speculated that a determining factor if the decision were to be reconsidered is the degree to which abortion rights have become deeply ingrained in American values Beside mapping out strategies the participants spent considerable time grappling with the more subtle philosophical questions surrounding abortion some of them familiar some new Along with the moral issues involved the conference considered how technological advances are changing the abortion debate by allowing treatment of fetuses in the womb and by permitting the fetus to survive outside the womb at earlier stages of gestation how that technology is affecting the rights of women to make decisions how to reconcile individual freedom with the interests of the state and how to reconcile religion with public policy And there were calls to action Miss Burstein who gave an address said We must show our presence when there is a relevant vote We must not let the righttolife people speak and not answer them

JUDGE HALTS ABORTION PLAN OF 2 CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/02/nyregion/judge-halts-abortion-plan-of-2-clinics.html,Two Planned Parenthood clinics in upstate New York may not provide abortions a judge ruled today in a suit initiated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany The judge Justice Harold J Hughes of State Supreme Court here said the State Health Department had acted capriciously by using improper procedures to determine whether to allow abortions at the clinics in Albany and Hudson He invalidated the clinics abortion licenses and ordered the department to reconsider the applications using different procedures In an important twist to the ruling Justice Hughes found that the diocese itself  as what he termed a corporate entity  could not be a party to the suit He said it could not show that it would be directly affected by the performing of abortions at the clinics But the justice said two individuals who had joined the diocese in the suit including a nun had legal standing to sue No Move Yet to Appeal The ruling was a victory for Bishop Howard J Hubbard the originator of the suit who had made several challenges to the procedure of granting permits He has said that his opposition to abortion was total and that he would do everything legally possible to stop it Todays decision was not expected to affect abortion clinics already in operation in the state because a statute limits the time during which challenges can be made against the licensing process A challenge must be brought within four months of the date a license takes effect Peter Slocum a spokesman for the State Health Department said no other applications for abortion clinics were pending He said the state had not decided whether to appeal the ruling or to reconsider the application using a different set of criteria than the ones rejected by the judge Planned Parenthood and other groups involved in providing abortions expressed outrage at Justice Hughess decision Rule Is Found Lacking The judge has played directly into the hands of the Bishop of Albany said Alfred F Moran the executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City The Bishops object is to limit access and obstruct access to abortions Judges on the state level as well as the Federal level have an obligation to intervene to see that those obstacles are not put between women and their constitutional right In his 10page ruling Justice Hughes emphasized that this case does not involve the legality or morality of abortions All that is before this court the Justice wrote is whether the Department of Health properly handled Planned Parenthoods application and whether petitioners may challenge the approval of that application At the heart of todays decision is something called the 50 percent rule When the Health Department reviews an application for an abortion clinic it looks at the total number of abortions performed within the geographical area the clinic would serve If more than 50 percent of the abortions are performed in hospitals according to a department spokesman the agency is usually disposed to grant a license to a clinic on the premise that there is a need for cheaper more easily accessible abortions If fewer than 50 percent of the abortions are performed in hospitals the department is usually inclined to deny a license to a clinic In the area to be served by the two clinics in todays ruling the Health Department said that only 12 percent of abortions were performed outside hospitals But Justice Hughes called the 50 percent rule arbitrary and said it was an unwritten undated department policy of which those affected have not been given notice It is settled law the Justice wrote that the Commissioner acts arbitrarily when he decides public need based upon a rigid numerical policy He ordered the Health Department to reconsider the application without applying the 50 percent rule In another defeat for the state and Planned Parenthood the Justice for the most part rejected their attempts to put limits on who can bring suit to block an abortion clinic He did eliminate the diocese saying that as a corporate entity it needed to show it was an organization representing healthcare consumers adversely affected by the decision But he said that just about anyone who was a healthservice consumer within the district where the abortion clinics will be located was free to sue The Rev Michael A Farano the chancellor of the diocese said it was pleased with the ruling As far as were concerned its a victory he said We have maintained consistently that our position in this matter has been substantive We are pleased that the court has sustained this Dr Mary Kahl president of the board of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood which runs the two clinics involved in todays decision said the group had not decided whether to appeal The clinics have offered other medical services for some time it was not until Jan 11 that they received licenses to perform abortions The diocese immediately sued and won a temporary injunction blocking any abortions
"STAGE: IN NEW HAVEN, 'THE COMMON PURSUIT'",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/02/theater/stage-in-new-haven-the-common-pursuit.html,Picture The Big Chill populated by wildly fictionalized caricatures of Kenneth Tynan Ian Hamilton and Clive James  or Merrily We Roll Along transplanted to Londons toniest literary warrens  and youll have an idea of the indecent pleasures to be had in Simon Grays new play The Common Pursuit In this acidic comedy the authors first since Quartermaines Terms we follow five of Cambridge Universitys best and brightest young literary stars from their halcyon common room days in the mid1960s through a decade and a halfs worth of personal and professional travails Mr Grays characters aspire to the high intellectual ideals exemplified by the F R Leavis book from which the play borrows its title they settle quickly instead for petty adulteries BBC talk show gigs and flip journalistic assignments from Vogue The plays only semblance of a hero is the one man who doesnt destroy any lives except his own When I first saw The Common Pursuit in its London premiere last summer it seemed a formulaic effort from a playwright whose past works include Butley and Otherwise Engaged In its American premiere at the Long Wharf Theater the play is still superficial  but highly entertaining in its superficiality Since the summer Mr Gray has polished the script  not to the extent of deepening it but certainly to the point of sharpening its cleverness And the Long Wharfs director Kenneth Frankel who also did Quartermaine has helped out mightily by fielding a looserlimbed production than Harold Pinters London version Mr Pinter tended to stage The Common Pursuit as if it could carry the weight of his own Betrayal Mr Frankel working with an exemplary American cast lets Mr Grays chronicle of dissipated lives roll along merrily indeed What makes the play enjoyable is its piquant erudition and bountiful supply of upscale soapopera plot twists After the introductory Trinity College sequence each scene leaps forward a few years and each comes equipped with a juicy new development or two a marriage or divorce a birth or abortion a publishing triumph or fiasco a hetero or homosex ual debauch Though some of the narrative variations are mechanical  notably those involving two celebrated poets kept off stage  others are ingenious A casual opening bit of farcical business in which one of the young men inadvertently walks in on a pals sexual escapade reverberates through somber crises to come With no shame whatsoever Mr Gray piles on ironic events that as one line acknowledges are of the kind that only happen in literature That the characters steady degeneration never seems melodramatic is a tribute to the buoyancy of both the dialogue and the cast Playing a rumpled critic who prostitutes both his writing and love life Nathan Lane is such a puckish satyr that his most selfdestructive binges are charming he can make us laugh at a witty defense of cigarette smoking even as hes dying of emphysema Peter Friedman as a brilliant Scottish philosopherpoet who cant perform his worldly tasks to his own satisfaction makes us chuckle not sigh when he decides to abandon his ca reerlong effort to write a masterwork on Wagner Everything Ive written about him reduces him to my own sort of size he explains Which makes him too small to be interesting to me No less delightful are Mark Arnott as a oncepromising historian who devotes his energies to coffeetable tomes and compulsive philandering and Michael Countryman as a self confessed notalent who lives vicariously through his friends Theyre both far too ingenuous to be pitied If anything Mr Arnott the most unabashed of Lotharios and Mr Countryman the most generousspirited of nerds make moral weakness seem an appealing spiritual calling The one strained performance comes from William ConverseRob erts in the lead role of Stuart a high minded esthete who cant balance his devotion to his wife a spirited Ellen Parker with his dedication to his elitist literary journal named The Common Pursuit Its not the actors fault that he seems ill at ease His part like the others is sketched not fully written  but because it is the largest role Mr ConverseRob erts cant hide behind bon mots and is instead sacrificed to the sketchiness When the uncompromising Stuart suddenly relinquishes his deeply held private and professional goals at center stage we realize that Mr Gray has not made us understand why  and its beyond any actors power to fill in the blanks While the other characters betrayals sellouts and lies are not subjected to the same audience scrutiny as Stuarts  they are often announced briskly after the fact  they seem just as arbitrarily motivated in retrospect Such is the toll taken when a plot decrees its characters behavior rather than the other way around With such authorial determinism at play The Common Pursuit cant be as moving as the similarly structured Quartermaine  or as resonant as the work it most closely resembles Frederic Raphaels Glittering Prizes But we dont ask too many questions while the evening rushes selfassuredly on Even David Jenkinss inventive set  which propels the young men clear across the stage to rendezvous with destiny  adds just the right gloss of sweep and depth to an evening of shallow but captivating fun The Cast THE COMMON PURSUIT by

HOMICIDE COUNTS DROPPED FOR DOCTOR IN ABORTION OF 32-WEEK FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/03/us/homicide-counts-dropped-for-doctor-in-abortion-of-32-week-fetus.html,Murder and involuntary manslaughter charges against an obstetrician who aborted a 32week fetus have been dropped but he has been ordered to face lesser felony charges Judge Michael Conroy ruled Thursday after a preliminary hearing in Municipal Court that the state had not presented enough evidence to prosecute the homicide charges against Dr Joseph Melnick who performed the abortion on a 13yearold girl last Sept 12 at West Park Hospital The remaining counts are infanticide and abortion after viability lesser felonies under the states Abortion Control Act of 1983 Prosecutors say they believe Dr Melnick is the first physician to face a criminal trial in connection with an abortion in Pennsylvania John Hagerty a spokesman for District Attorney Edward G Rendell said the office was considering the possibility of rearresting Dr Melnick on the murder and manslaughter charges and obtaining another preliminary hearing a move that is permitted under Pennsylvania law Conflicting Testimony The fourday preliminary hearing produced conflicting testimony over whether it was a stillborn fetus or a living viable baby that emerged after Dr Melnick induced labor by administering a drug The Assistant Medical Examiner Dr Halbert Fillinger testified that there was a living being after the abortion and that the cause of death was homicide from inadequate medical care Joseph Dougherty an orderly in the operating room with Dr Melnick testified that when he weighed the newborn which was three pounds nine ounces he heard it gasp He said it remained on the scale for an hour and that he heard another gasp when he picked it up to follow Dr Melnicks instructions to place it in the hospitals morgue Other witnesses who were present said there was a heartbeat of 20 beats per minute However expert witnesses for the defense contended that the abortion produced a stillborn fetus Dr Cyril Wecht a former Allegheny County Coroner who is now director of pathology at Pittsburghs Central Medical Hospital said vital signs had been so minimal as to indicate the absence of any meaningful circulation of the blood necessary to provide oxygen to the brain and other organs He said he based his conclusion on microscopic slides from the newborns tissues that were unavailable at the time of Dr Fillingers examination Eyewitnesses may have mistaken involuntary muscle contractions after death for heartbeats or breath Dr Wecht added Lawyer Voices Optimism Sheldon Albert Dr Melnicks attorney said his client was extremely gratified that the homicide charges had been dropped Mr Albert characterized the remaining charges as technical under the new abortion law adding No jury in the world is going to conclude that this was anything but a mistake But Assistant District Attorney John DiDonato said the remaining counts were fairly serious charges that each carry a possible prison sentence of three and a half to seven years The prosecution believes in Mr DiDonatos words that Dr Melnick knew the child was alive and he not only did not provide care but he went out of his way to convince other people not to provide it That to me is murder he declared Pennsylvanias abortion law does not define viability At 32 weeks or nearly eight months fetuses are generally considered viable and most hospitals and physicians will not perform abortions The defense argued that Dr Melnick had mistakenly believed before the abortion that the fetus was 16 to 18 weeks old The Pennsylvania law defines abortion after viability as intentionally knowingly or recklessly aborting a fetus capable of survival after birth and infanticide as failing to provide in good faith judgment treatment commonly and customarily given to a baby born alive
JUDGE TO DECIDE IF POOR CAN GET ABORTION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/03/nyregion/judge-to-decide-if-poor-can-get-abortion-funds.html,income women in Connecticut have had abortions that were paid for by the state But if the state gets its way poor women seeking abortions in the future may have to look elsewhere for funds The issue will be decided by Superior Court Judge Robert I Berdon who will hear testimony in a lawsuit brought against the state by lawyers for lowincome women The trial is scheduled to begin next month in New Haven The plaintiffs lawyers will argue that lowincome women are entitled to have their abortions paid for by Medicaid a program in which the state helps pay the medical bills of the poor State officials some of whom say they personally support the right of women to have abortions will argue that the government should not be in the business of subsidizing abortions The trial will be heard amid deepening public discussion of the abortion issue and increasing efforts by antiabortion activists around the nation to deny Medicaid benefits for abortions Connecticut is one of only 14 states that pay for abortions for poor women according to the National Womens Health Network a publicinterest group based in Washington DC In Connecticut however there has been little public debate over the practice since the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union representing a single mother of five identified only as Rosie J Doe filed its suit against the state in August of 1981 It was prompted when the Department of Income Maintenance reinstated a state rule in February 1981 that stipulated that Medicaid funds for abortions be provided only to preserve the womans life or in cases of rape or incest The department tailored its rule to the Federal Hyde Amendment which withheld Federal funds for abortions except when the womans life was endangered In October 1981 Judge Berdon expanded the case into a class action lawsuit on behalf of all lowincome women and issued a temporary injunction that said the state must pay for therapeutic abortions for the poor Therapeutic or medically necessary abortions could include those deemed necessary to protect a womans psychological health as well as her physical health Since then 5436 women have had abortions at a cost to the state of 1 million according to the State Department of Income Maintenance which administers the Medicaid program The department estimates that there are 42000 women in the state in their childbearing years who are eligible for Medicaid funds Antiabortion activists have done little to object to the practice Most of us were waiting to see what happens in the courts said Regina R Smith of North Branford a former State Senator and leading abortion opponent She said that although she contemplated introducing legislation or a constitutional amendment banning state financing for abortions when she was in the Senate it would be difficult to sell an amendment when we have a court case waiting to be decided Meanwhile neither side was eager to bring the case to trial The civil liberties union would have preferred to let the temporary injunction stand rather than risk an unfavorable decision in court said its executive director William R Olds The organization also feared the publicity that a trial would bring It was a tactical decision for fear it would spur some legislative action that would restrict state funds for abortions he said As for the state Attorney General Joseph I Lieberman said he was not immediately aware of the Rosie J Doe case when he took office in January 1983 Mr Lieberman now finds himself in the uncomfortable situation of having to defend a state rule he personally opposes Its an awkward situation said Mr Lieberman As a State Senator he voted for an unsuccessful bill that would have required Medicaid financing for abortions But Governor ONeill who has said he favors abortion only when the womans life is endangered supports the states position said J W Jackson the Governors legal counsel He said the General Assembly has not authorized the Department of Income Maintenance department to make the Medicaid payments The appeal is designed to keep Connecticut law in conformance with the Federal regulations Mr Jackson said The Governor is not in favor of abortion for convenience sake As a result Attorney General Lieberman said we have an obligation to give it a defense and get a decision by a trial judge He added however that if the judge rules against the state I dont know that we will appeal We will take a fresh look at it then It was left to Judge Berdon to order the two sides back to court Neither party was pushing it Judge Berdon said It has to be resolved one way or the other Lawyers for the civil liberties union will argue that poor women who face physical emotional or psychological harm if they do not receive an abortion should be entitled to Medicaid funds They also will assert that low income women are entitled to reimbursement for abortions under several provisions of the state Constitution  its equal rights amendment and guarantees of equal protection privacy and due process To single out one medical procedure for prohibition is a dangerous intrusion of the government into an individuals right of personal privacy Mr Olds said The states lawyers will argue that the Connecticut Constitution while giving women the right to have an abortion does not guarantee them public financing for that abortionThey will assert that the state Constitution does not give women more rights to government financing for abortions than does the United States Constitution The United States Supreme Court in upholding the Hyde Amendment ruled in 1980 that there is no Constitutional guarantee of public financing for abortions Both Mr Olds and Mr Lieberman said there is a likelihood that Judge Berdon given the strong language in his decision granting the injunction will again rule in favor of the lowincome women In that ruling Judge Berdon said that the states former practice of denying funds for abortion is contrary to our public policy which requires the state to pay for all necessary medical expenses for the poor Withholding Medicaid benefits from medically necessary abortions is basically unfair and cruel Judge Berdon wrote It places an enormous burden on a segment of our population which is least able to fend for themselves  poor women And there is no conceivable justification for this intrusion into the Constitutional rights of these women
JACK KEMP'S YEAR OF DECISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/03/magazine/jack-kemp-s-year-of-decision.html,JACK KEMP IS ON HIS WAY TO the White House As he gets off the elevator in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill he sees a boy carrying a stack of boxes and gives the startled lad a playful cuff on the shoulder Kemp does not walk to the car he bounces toward it emitting waves of restless energy the way a radiator spreads heat The snazzy silver Thunderbird with the plush red seats is already at the garage door and he is momentarily embarrassed by the automotive finery Its leased he protests not owned As the Thunderbird leaves Capitol Hill Kemp recognizes a journalist in the car in front At the next red light he lunges out the door and shouts at the reporter When are you going to interview me During the drive up Pennsylvania Avenue the talk turns to politics and the Congressman from upstate New York says that he is glad now that he did not run for the Senate in 1980 or for Governor of New York in 1982 To be frank he says who has more influence over economic policy A junior member of the Senate or me Yes he acknowledges those unconsummated flirtations have left him with a reputation in the political community for indecisiveness but he will probably make a firm decision by the end of this year whether to run for President in 1988 Campaigning for the White House has turned into a fouryear marathon and potential candidates start lining up money and manpower for the next race even before a new President is inaugurated Kemp knows that his friends will start drifting toward other candidates if he does not signal his intentions early on and while he remains a bit coy on the subject he is clearly ready to go Those 50000 names stashed in his computer and waiting to be tapped for campaign cash are not just a Christmas card list Am I interested he asks rhetorically The answer is yes The Thunderbird pulls up to the White House where Kemp will join other House Republican leaders and President Reagans advisers for a strategy session on the budget The guard asks for identification and Kemp expresses annoyance that he is not instantly waved through While his IDs are checked Kemps eyes eagerly roam the sidewalk and fasten on a familiar face Kemp calls his friend over and on his way the man tells the guard jokingly Let him through Hell be President someday When Kemps friend mentions that his motherinlaw is in town from Montana the Congressman practically shouts with delight Did you know that my mother is from Miles City Montana As the guard waves the car through the gate Kemp calls out Tell everyone in Montana hello When the Congressmen emerge an hour later they strike a familiar tableau on the White House driveway Kemp is talking the others are listening Now 49 the onetime quarterback of the Buffalo Bills retains the cleanjawed handsomeness of a football star posing for a Wheaties box At 6 feet and 200 pounds he has the burly shoulders that could propel a ball 70 yards down field A reporter asks for a comment on proposed budget cuts and Kemp answers Cuts have got to be part of an agenda for growth    We cant just offer sacrifice    Thats not what the President ran on    An aide hauls the Congressman into the car before he launches into a fulldress speech but the words linger in the nippy air as the Thunderbird edges through the evening traffic on its way back to Capitol Hill Jack French Kemp has spoken those same phrases many thousands of times since coming to Washington 14 years ago as a freshman Congressman He has marched through the land proclaiming with evangelical earnestness that economic growth and expanding opportunity are the keys to the kingdom It is a message made for the television age upbeat as a beer commercial and easily marketed in a 30second spot and the old quarterback has used it to establish himself as a politician of allpro caliber This week as President Reagan delivers his State of the Union address and Congress gets down to business Kemp will be starting the most important season of his political career As the thirdranking Republican in the House and as a senior member of the Budget Committee he will be playing a leading role in the main debate facing the 99th Congress how to reduce a Federal budget deficit that threatens to soar past 200 billion a year He has already staked out his position deriding fellow Republicans for their hysterical concentration on massive spending cuts and insisting that economic growth will eliminate the need for painful budget surgery In fact Kemp is the chief author of two bills designed to achieve that end One would provide tax benefits for companies willing to invest in enterprise zones and create new jobs in declining regions of the country The other bill would restructure the tax code by reducing and simplifying rates while eliminating many shelters and loopholes Kemps theory is that lowering the rates would give entrepreneurs more incentive to produce and earn and that this rising tide of economic activity would lift all boats so to speak and fill the Treasurys depleted coffers Some Republican leaders are skeptical that either bill will become law though President Reagan expressed support for both concepts in his Inaugural address Kemp has a larger importance however His upbeat positive message has inspired a whole new generation of lawmakers and helped spark the revival of the GOP as a party of ideas and innovation Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia calls him the first Republican in modern times to show it is possible to be hopeful and conservative at the same time The beginning of the Presidents second term also marks the beginning of the postReagan era in American politics The Republicans are already looking for a Presidential candidate in 1988 who can carry on the Reagan revolution by continuing their drive to become the nations dominant party And to many strategists in both parties the man who wants to say hello to all those good folks in Montana has a solid claim to being the Presidents legitimate heir More than any other potential nominee they feel he has the sort of personal charm and appeal that has made Ronald Reagan so effective And from a political viewpoint he has the best chance of emulating the Presidents extraordinary ability to expand the Republican base and reach out to independent voters In fact the Inaugural address with its evocation of an American renewal sounded very much like a speech Kemp could have delivered Edward S Rollins who ran the Presidents last campaign favors Vice President Bush for the nomination in 1988 but admits If the Vice President chose to run and asked me to run his campaign the candidate I would least like to run against is Jack Kemp Yet for all of his potential Kemp remains an untested and uncertain quantity On the personal level some politicians who know him well still view Kemp as an intellectual lightweight a onetime jock with a good barber and a smooth tan stuffed full of ideas that he does not completely understand Dave Hoppe his chief of staff admits that the Congressman comes on like a bulldozer at times and turns some people off with his All American ego On the political level these qualities have brought Kemp his share of enemies Moreover many politicians still see the tax cut of 1981  co sponsored by Kemp and Senator William V Roth Jr the Delaware Republican  as voodoo economics a wrongheaded plan that threatens eventually to swamp the recovery in a tidal wave of deficits Kemp himself admits that his political future is inextricably tied to the health of the economy In truth Jack Kemp is a bit of a mystery a blending of contradictory elements that defies an easy label but that broadens his political appeal He is a conservative WASP from Southern California who built his political career in Buffalo a largely Catholic bluecollar city he believes in cutting taxes but not in emasculating the government he is cheered by business leaders in Dallas and by blacks at a memorial program for the Rev Martin Luther King Jr in Atlanta But the main reason Ed Rollins fears Jack Kemp is that the man possesses an extra dimension an intangible but invaluable aura that touches only a few politicians in any generation Part of it is that vitality that sends him bounding through life cuffing shoulders and cadging converts as he goes And part of it is that indelible image of the gallant gladiator repeatedly facing danger as the screams of thousands echo through the bright Sundays of the past As Lee Atwater the deputy director of the 1984 Reagan campaign noted athletes might well be the new American heroes who can transcend party loyalties And Robert D Squier a Democratic consultant and film maker adds Reagan as the Gipper only played a football player Kemp really was a football player ONE NIGHT RECENTly Kemp was flying back to Washington from one of his frequent political forays into the hinterlands The airline steward offered cocktails but Kemp shook his head and explained that he and his wife Joanne were reared in strict religious homes and seldom drink more than a glass of wine The Congressman is practically addicted to CocaCola though and once he had one in hand Kemp was ready to talk about his family and his early years His parents left the Middle West around 1920 and settled in Los Angeles where his father ran a small trucking company and his mother was a social worker They had four boys  Jack was the third  and in their comfortable middleclass home he recalled Everything was sports sports sports Asked to write a school composition about a great invention he chose the forward pass By his own admission Kemp seldom cracked a book at Occidental College a local school whose main attraction was a football squad with an offense that trained him for the pros And after graduation in 1957 the Detroit Lions drafted him on the 17th round I had no doubt Id play pro football Kemp said I dont want to sound mystical but I knew Id play somewhere So the young hero married the girl from the sorority house next door and went off to fulfill his destiny But he never made it with the Lions or any other team in the National Football League and when the American Football League started in 1960 Kemp jumped at the chance to play for the Los Angeles Chargers who moved to San Diego the next year In those days he recalled the quarterback was really a field general reading the opposing teams defense and calling the plays on his own and that taught him some useful lessons about leadership As Kemp once told an interviewer You never heard of a quarterback in his life that goes into a huddle and says does anybody have a play Football teaches resiliency too Eddie Mahe a Republican political consultant pointed out When you get pounded into the turf you have to get up off your butt and get on with it Thats not bad training for this business During his years with the Chargers Kemp fell under the influence of two men who helped form his political view of the world One was Herbert G Klein editor of The San Diego Union and an insider in California Republican circles Klein saw the young quarterback as a promising political property and during the offseason he had Kemp work for the paper writing articles and absorbing tenets of the conservative creed A very different mentor was Sid Gillman the coach of the Chargers a liberal who belonged to the National Urban League The team was integrated and when it played in the South Gillman never let his players use segregated facilities Unlike many conservatives Kemp is a strong advocate of civil rights and Federal help for minorities and his position stems partly from his football experiences Jack commented Newt Gingrich literally showered with guys that most Republicans never meet In 1962 a crushed knuckle on his throwing hand put Kemp out for the season and when the Chargers failed to protect their rights to the quarterback the Buffalo Bills snatched him away for the token price of 100 Kemp kept up his ties to California and during the offseason in 1967 he even served a brief apprenticeship in the office of the new Governor Ronald Reagan But it was Buffalo that really advanced his political education Kemp found himself living and playing in a city dominated by bluecollar trade unionists with Democratic roots who worried about jobs and paychecks in a town in which the basic industries were collapsing around them That was a real blessing for me he recalled as the flight neared Washington That disabused me very early about ideology winning campaigns Those guys wanted answers they wanted problems solved Kemp helped organize the first union of American Football League players in 1965 As president he negotiated a pension plan with league owners an exercise that honed his political skills By 1968 the Republican organization in Buffalo was asking him to run for Congress and by 1970  with his arm fading  Kemp was ready to accept THE OLD QUARTERback sneaked in with 52 percent of the vote and he came to Washington as a freshman Congressman with a lot to learn about public policy But he began reading widely mainly in economics and one bit of history intrigued him The tax cut enacted during the Kennedy Administration had engendered a strong recovery Then The Wall Street Journal ran a piece by Jude Wanniski one of its editorial writers outlining the theories of Robert Mundell a Canadian economist Mundell made the case for supplyside economics the concept that tax cuts lead to economic expansion and an inevitable increase in tax revenues Soon Kemp made contact with Wanniski and other followers of the supplyside faith particularly Irving Kristol the editor of The Public Interest During many months of talk often far into the night at the Kemps house in suburban Maryland the supply siders refined their thoughts into the KempRoth taxreduction bill It was a radical idea says Charlie Black a political consultant who worked for the Republican National Committee at the time but politically it had great value The Republican Party since Hoover had been viewed as the party of the rich and Big Business After Watergate the corruption image was added into it Of the first 10 things people thought about Republicans eight or nine were negative It didnt take a genius to see the way to shake our terrible image was to take Jack Kemps bill and his rhetoric and spread it to the partys candidates For the first time in years Republican candidates were out there running for something not just against something During the late 1970s Ronald Reagan became enamored of supplyside ideas and espoused them during his campaign for the Republican nomination but the Congressmans supporters were suspicious of Reagans sincerity and urged Kemp to make the run himself As Jude Wanniski tells the story Kemp met Reagan for lunch during the summer of 1979 and spent hours grilling the candidate about his commitment to supplyside economics Kemps wife was along and according to Wanniski was mortified at her husbands behavior But finally an agreement was reached Reagan would support the KempRoth tax cut During his first year in office President Reagan kept his promise and eventually KempRoth was passed but the New Yorker shunned the tedious work of legislative deliberation In fact when the President agreed to a compromise bill that cut rates by only 25 percent rather than the 30 percent cut included in the original measure Kemp stormed down to the White House and publicly criticized the President Kemp has never been very interested in the backroom maneuvering that gets things done on Capitol Hill Only recently has he begun to play more of an inside game and insist that he wants to be known as a good legislator His first real effort took place after the 1980 elections when he became the ranking Republican on the Appropriations subcommittee handling foreign aid When the foreign aid bill came up he spent days on the floor carefully following the debate and helping to shape the final product He also spent a lot of time in the Republican cloakroom pressuring his conservative colleagues to swallow their ideological concerns Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi for example said that the only reason he backed the bill was Kemps persistence and persuasion Lott the Republican whip added In the last two years Jack has showed that he was not just someone flying around the country making speeches HE STILL DOES HIS share of flying around though and he can afford to His seat is safe helped by redistricting that cut out some heavily Democratic neighborhoods and spliced in some rural Republican territory As a result Kemp admits he has not paid much attention to the home front And though he stays on top of issues that affect the district he is basically a national political figure who happens to represent upstate New York In that national role he is constantly on the go building up his political contacts and capital Not long ago for instance he flew to Texas at the behest of Steve Bartlett a young Republican Congressman to take part in a luncheon program at the Dallas Assembly a highpowered civic association He has made more than 100 such outof town appearances in the last two years and now he can add Bartletts iou to the stack Kemp was dressed for the trip in his standard uniform glistening white shirt somber dark suit gold collar pin preppy striped tie The trim figure is slightly padded at the waist now and the thick neck is creased with wrinkles his immaculate swirl of sandy hair is threaded with gray But as he waited to board the plane fellow passengers could not keep their eyes off him Kemp took it all in stride As Ed Rollins notes Kemp like Ronald Reagan has always been a star has always had people looking at him Thats what separates them from the rest of us earthlings Rollins says At the airport in Texas a young man who had helped organize the luncheon was waiting with a car As the car passed Texas Stadium the Congressman was telling a story that conveys the intensity that smolders inside this man When his finger was injured while with the San Diego Chargers he was told it would never be flexible again So the quarterback asked the doctors to mold the cast while he gripped a football That way the finger would heal at the same angle as the ball Kemp held up his hands for inspection and the light caught two massive rings Kemp always wears The day before he had been asked about them after a speech in Washington One he replied was for the American Football League Championship in 1965 when he played with the Buffalo Bills the other marked him as a member of the Bills Hall of Fame Looking straight at the questioner the old quarterback said somberly Theres a lot of blood in those babies On the way into Dallas from the airport the driver described the format for the luncheon program a debate between Kemp and Representative Richard A Gephardt a Missouri Democrat who has also sponsored a tax reform bill Kemp would speak first the driver said innocently since he had won the toss of the coin Kemp flared up like a gas jet and hissed at the driver I thought winning the coin toss meant you get to choose whether you go first or not For several more minutes he chewed on the issue and finally snapped I suppose youll decide who won the debate too The luncheon was held in the Anatole the glossy hotel where President Reagan stayed during the Republican convention and the debate was vintage Kemp He condemned the traditional Republican Party as following a rootcanal view of economics that stressed austerity not opportunity The tax system he said to loud applause from the wellheeled and wellfed audience should not be aimed at making the rich poor but aimed at making the poor rich To many Democrats this sort of talk makes Kemp the Dr Feelgood of American politics Gephardt a rusty haired fellow with an even temper was moved to fury He turned on Kemp and snapped Nobody wants to talk about sacrifice It is a bleak message But the world doesnt work that way There is no free lunch Kemp was blithely unperturbed Some people have called my ideas simplistic he retorted So be it Afterward Kay Hutchison a local Republican activist explained Kemps appeal this way The Republican Party is getting stronger by the minute here and Kemp is considered very effective Hes been here quite a bit so people know him Hes a personality no doubt about that And hes done a lot of substantive things Hes very good at keeping his name in the forefront OVER THE NEXT SIX months Jack Kemps name is sure to stay in the forefront as Congress struggles with taxes and budget Out of his concern that Bob Dole the new Republican leader in the Senate and a likely Presidential contender in 1988 is placing too much emphasis on deficit reduction and not enough on progrowth policies Kemp has developed a twopart strategy One is an outside move get the President and the White House staff on your side and then convince them to use their political leverage on Congress Last month for instance Kemp joined a group of likeminded House Republican leaders who met at the White House with James A Baker 3d the chief of staff who has been designated as the new Treasury Secretary The Republicans left they say with a commitment from Baker that whenever budget cuts were discussed at the White House tax simplification would be on the agenda as well The other element in Kemps plan is a more traditional inside strategy The man who denounced all compromise on KempRoth four years ago is now welcoming suggestions particularly from Democrats The original enterprise zone bill for instance cosponsored with Robert Garcia Bronx Democrat called for 75 districts around the country Representative Charles B Rangel a Harlem Democrat who sits on the Ways and Means Committee wanted three times that number as a way of boosting the bills appeal Recently when Kemp was addressing a largely black audience in Washington he proudly announced that he had accepted the amendment of his good friend Charlie Rangel Compromise is also Kemps approach to his taxsimplification bill cowritten by Senator Robert W Kasten Jr of Wisconsin His version would eliminate most deduc tions tax credits and exemptions all income would then be taxed at a flat rate of 25 percent as opposed to the current schedule which goes up to 50 percent But Kemp lavishes praise on the two alternative proposals one produced by Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan before he was tapped to become White House chief of staff the other by Representative Gephardt and Senator Bill Bradley New Jersey Democrat At a press conference several weeks ago called by House Republican leaders Kemp stressed the need to cooperate with these Democrats and build some kind of bridge across the aisle on economic policy His fellow Republicans who were in a more combative and partisan mood practi cally had to wrestle the microphone away from him But Kemp says flatly that tax simplification aint gonna fly in this Congress unless a plan is developed that has the support of both parties and the President Kemp and his ideas are not always popular in Congress Much of the Republican leadership wants to put tax simplification on a back burner while they deal with the deficit and they are impatient with Kemps insistence that an expanding economy will erase the budget shortfall Senator Alan K Simpson of Wyoming the new Republican whip summed up the orthodox Republican view when he said No slot machine on earth pays off like that The new generation of young conservatives in the House who have bedeviled the Democratic leadership over the last year see Kemp as their spiritual godfather according to Representative Gingrich But Kemp disagrees with their guiding premise that confrontation with the Democrats is always the best policy He shares such basic New Right positions as opposing abortion and favoring school prayer but he has never taken a lead on these measures and warns Republican candidates that they can narrow their political appeal by focusing on such social issues Kemps most natural allies on Capitol Hill these days are younger Democrats like Gephardt and Bradley Both men say that the Republicans were politically astute to adopt the Kempian emphasis on economic growth and that they would like to see the Democrats ride the same issue AS THESE LEGISLATIVE battles develop so will the political maneuvering for 1988 Kemp discussed his prospects one day in Capitol Hill office a room dominated by pictures of his wife and four irrepressibly photogenic children ranging in age from 13 to 25 The oldest child Jeff is a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams Will Jack Kemp run for the Presidency The minority view based on his past cautiousness is that he will shrink from the challenge I do not lust after the Presidency he will say emphasizing the need to have something burning in your belly Does he have that fire I dont know he says But most analysts do not give much weight to such obligatory coyness The dominant view is that Kemp wants to be President and that he will come under fierce pressure from his supporters to make the race Meanwhile the Congressman is certainly acting like a candidate His own political action committee the Campaign for Prosperity raised and donated more than 200000 in cash to Republican candidates for the 1984 elections Another 50000 was used to finance Kemps travels around the country where he is in demand more than any other Republican except Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford Among the Congressmans major contributors are the likes of George Champion former chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank Tom Landry the coach of the Dallas Cowboys and Herbert H Dow who sits on the board of the family chemical company The list also includes Richard J Fox chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition Kemps ardent support of Israel over the years has won him wide backing in the Jewish community But election laws strictly limit the size of individual contributions making a wide base of support essential Kemps PAC has assembled a list of 50000 proven supporters and monthly fundraising appeals to those donors are expected to begin shortly For now the proceeds will be funneled to other Republicans but a quick change in the computer code and that list becomes the basis of a Kempfor President campaign Kemp is also beefing up his staff with people who are not particularly interested in running a Congressional campaign in upstate New York John P Maxwell a party official from Texas joins the staff next month and he just happens to have experience running Senate campaigns in Iowa site of the first Presidential caucuses John Buckley a nephew of William F Buckley Jr and former Senator James L Buckley is Kemps new press secretary he was deputy press secretary for the 1984 ReaganBush campaign IF JACK KEMP RUNS for the GOP nomination can he win it The conventional wisdom in Republican ranks is that George Bushs unswerving loyalty to the President has earned him the support of many Reaganites and the position of front runner But as John Sears a veteran Republican strategist noted any Vice President is obliged to be the partys greatest loyalist In Searss view Bush will have a terrible problem establishing himself as an independent figure apart from President Reagan Bob Dole another potential rival has made a strong start as the new majority leader of the Senate but he is clearly gambling his future on the ability of Congressional Republicans to reduce the deficit and insure economic prosperity Doles predecessor as majority leader Howard H Baker Jr has quit the Senate altogether so he can devote full time to making money and running for President but he has not yet been able to inspire any major political support for a run Ed Rollins the former ReaganBush strategist sums up a widely held view in Republican ranks when he says I think the potential is certainly there for Kemp to come down as the alternative to Bush For one thing Kemp starts with an unusually broad geographical base California where he grew up New York where he now lives and the socalled Southern Rim where an emerging Republican Party responds to him eagerly He also has strong ties to the partys rightwing activists Kemp says Lee Atwater Rollinss deputy on the ReaganBush campaign has a better chance to plug into Reagans philosophical base than any other candidate The key to Kemps campaign could well be his ability to reach beyond the people who usually decide Republican nominations and bring in new participants At this early stage many analysts agree that among traditional Republicans Bush probably has the edge but if Kemp can expand the pool of primary voters he has a chance to overtake the Vice President Should Kemp ever get the nomination Democratic strategists agree he would be a tough opponent in the general election More than any other Republican some fear he could appeal to that crop of young independentminded voters who flocked to the Republican cause in 1980 and 1984 but have made no permanent commitment to the party and are up for grabs in future elections According to Lee Atwater Reagans appeal to this group in the last election can be summed up in one word success The President was a winner who promised voters that he would give them a chance at success in their own lives by lowering taxes and expanding economic opportunity Kemp too is a winner offering the same promise of change and progress As Raymond Strother a Democratic consultant who worked for Gary Hart put it Kemp seems to have the right message at the right time He conveys the idea that hes willing to change to experiment to break patterns and traditions The country is looking for change and Kemp represents the best the Republicans have to offer To some analysts Kemp shares something else with Ronald Reagan the ability to run against Washington Jack Kemp appeals to little people says Rollins He appeals to an antiEstablishment group out there and Baker and Dole and all the rest are perceived as being part of the Establishment In the view of Robert Squier the Democratic campaign consultant the nation is floating out of the party era as we have known it and entering an era in which we have to worry more about personalities and messages than party identification Television is the key to that new era and Kemp is a madeforTV candidate who can reach those independent voters without appealing either to partisan loyalty or political ideology Says Squier Kemp has a high enough level of energy to make the tube light up when hes on Kemp has one other quality that might be more important than all the rest He can tap into one of the basic myths of American life the myth of the hero who has fought in distant lands and survived the trial by fire For millions of Americans today professional sports  particularly football  has become a kind of civilian equivalent of war On the wall of Jack Kemps office hangs a photograph of a huge defensive lineman named Ernie Ladd looming over the young Kemp about to crush him to the earth That reminds me Kemp jokes that the bigger they are the harder they fall  on you But that photo says something else as well Ive been there Ive slain the dragon and lived to tell the tale For all his advantages though Jack Kemp has significant drawbacks as a candidate He has faced only one tough race in his political life the first one and he has never run beyond the narrow confines of his district No House member has run successfully for a Presidential nomination in this century and one reason is that Congressmen find it hard to compete for media attention Kemp has conquered that problem but he still must overcome the notion that House members lack the scope and experience particularly in foreign affairs to make good Presidents While many political strategists admire Kemps strengths they hardly consider him invincible The Congressman admits to being thinskinned and over sensitive On the MacNeilLehrer show he once blew up at a reporter and later had to apologize for his outburst Kemp can often sound like a JackieOne Note a speaker who tells you more than you ever wanted to know about the arcane intricacies of economic and monetary policy Only recently has he begun to take himself a bit less seriously Now he can sometimes look at a photograph for example and crack Theres me in a typical pose  with my mouth open Some who know Kemp have reservations about his intellectual range Supporters say he studies hard and can learn a subject if briefed thoroughly but he can seem quite uneasy and uncomfortable when faced with new or complex issues During the debate in Dallas Gephardt departed from economics and closed with an emotional discussion of the need to build better relations with the Russians Later walking out of the hotel Kemp admitted that he felt uneasy responding to the Democrats tactic I dont have any training in dialectics he said and no one has ever asked me to do anything like this before Some who are familiar with Kemp say that the old quarterback is too used to calling his own plays all the time that though he is hiring new aides he might not listen to them He just tends to believe he is capable of anything said a seasoned Republican official He doesnt think he needs a lot of advice and counsel in getting something done He has the strength of his own convictions and thats good But Im not sure how capable Jack is of listening Kemp replies that he has been listening and learning since he came to Washington 14 years ago I survived he said and I think I fooled a lot of people in this town They didnt think that there was much staying power to Jack Kemp that I really didnt have much below the surface that I couldnt hold my own in the tough battles But I think there is staying power to Jack Kemp frankly Whether he has enough staying power for the exhausting grind of a Presidential campaign remains to be seen But a man who has been wildly cheered and unmercifully booed by 50000 football fans on a Sunday afternoon in Buffalo knows something about the vicissitudes of life And the pundits who underestimated Ronald Reagan all those years could be getting ready to make the same mistake about Jack Kemp

ABORTION CLINIC BOMBINGS HAVE CAUSED DISRUPTION FOR MANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/06/us/abortion-clinic-bombings-have-caused-disruption-for-many.html,At 6 AM just when it was beginning to get light last Nov 19 the private security guard hired to protect the Metro Medical and Womens Center because of bomb threats and demonstrations went home The bomb went off at 613 or 615 said Penny Smith the administrator of the abortion clinic in Wheaton Md According to the detectives it was thrown through the front window No one told me when I was in college preparing to be a registered nurse that Id be involved in guerrilla warfare The antiabortion movement which simmered in frustration for 11 years after the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion exploded in violence last year The greatest cluster of destruction nine bombings occurred in and around the nations capital Frequently keyed to patriotic and religious holidays such as the Fourth of July Christmas Eve and New Years Day the bombings helped heighten public awareness of the intense feelings on both sides of the abortion issue And as an examination of the Washington area bombings shows they have also confronted the authorities with a kind of radical violence reminiscent of Vietnam War protests placed a legal institution under seige  damaged parties with no connection to the dispute and won strong sympathy from certain religious ranks Paradoxically the violence may also have led to more abortions Optometrist Is Very Angry The Wheaton explosion the largest of the antiabortion bombings in metropolitan Washington destroyed the clinic and rendered unusable three adjacent doctors offices those of a podiatrist a gastroenterologist and two optometrists The building has still not reopened although the abortion clinic is operating elsewhere The bombing wrecked the office of Dr Jacalyn Ely an optometrist specializing in visual therapy for children and adults It has put us out of business Dr Ely said I am still very angry These people dont realize that when they do this kind of thing they affect other peoples lives There are a lot of people affected who have nothing to do with the abortion issue On that same morning 15 minutes after the explosion in Wheaton two more bombs went off in nearby Rockville behind the building housing the Planned Parenthood clinic which provides counseling but no abortions The blasts did more damage to the offices of an obstetriciangynecologist and a small computer concern than they did to the clinic And they blew out bedroom and bathroom windows in a number of nearby houses Someone certainly could have been up and about and gotten hurt said Florence Seifert director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter 3 Charged With Conspiracy In the case of the Wheaton clinic there has been personal hurt Some of the clients were teenage girls needing contraceptive instruction Because of the bombing according to Mrs Smith they postponed those visits They were fearful she said They didnt know where else to go When we saw them again they were pregnant In two cases she said We have had them back as abortions Three men including the pastor of a small Lutheran congregation have been arrested and charged with conspiracy in eight of the bombings which damaged Federal and state offices as well as homes blew a hole in the wall of a bank destroyed a beauty parlor damaged the entrance of an office of the American Civil Liberties Union interrupted fertility treatments for childless couples and blew out all the windows on one side of the First Baptist Church in Suitland Md which has some antiabortion activists among its evangelical congregation In fact they didnt even get the clinic next door said Glen Niles associate pastor of the church Shocked from sleep in his house several blocks away by the two explosions on Christmas Eve Mr Niles and his pastor spent the rest of the night cleaning up debris and boarding up the windows of the church so the congregation could stay warm at Christmas services I Will Continue They ought to at least apologize for the inconvenience they caused the church Mr Niles said The bombs were placed next door to the church at the side of the building housing the abortion clinic But the clinic itself on the fifth floor was untouched by the explosions Dr A Gohari who delivers babies and performs abortions does not know whether his landlord will renew his lease this fall But the bombing has left him unshaken in his determination to perform abortions I will continue up to the last minute that it is legal he said They can kill me to stop me Since the bombing of the Hillcrest Surgi Center on Pennsylvania Avenue on New Years Day and the arrest of the three men by agents of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms who seized a large cache of weapons and explosives there have been no further bombings here But both bomb victims and foes of abortion suggest that the arson and bombings that have occurred around the nation are the product of a frustration that continues to build Theyre getting tired said Thomas Herlihy assistant coordinator of the ProLife Nonviolent Action Project in suburban Maryland which is modeled on the protest methods of the civil rights era Theyre getting frustrated The prolife movement is reaching the pressurecooker stage Civil Disobedience Urged If people believe what we believe Mr Herlihy said they might be out there bombing clinics He said that before he discovered there was another way to release the tension through civil disobedience and arrest he was close to violence himself I would say a couple of years ago I was about at that stage Mr Herlihy said I could see myself resorting to that going around and bombing clinics Now at 37 years old he has given up his job in New York to devote himself to the protest movement here The only way to end the violence he believes is to spread the gospel of nonviolent civil disobediance After a sitin or two these people are changed  its a tremendous outlet for all that frustration said Mr Herlihy who was one of nearly 30 demonstrators arrested in front of the Supreme Court Building on Jan 22 the 12th anniversary of the decision that legalized abortion The first bombing in the Washington area which occurred at the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk Va the night of Feb 17 1984 gave direct evidence that it was aimed at abortions and alerted the local authorities to the reality of violence as an antiabortion tactic Arson at a Virginia Clinic The clinic had received three telephoned bomb threats the last just two weeks before the bombing But Bonita Collins the clinics director had discounted the threat I was advised by the local lawenforcement officials that there had not been a bombing in any of Norfolk in over 20 years that people derived satisfaction just from making the threat she said Miss Collins accepted their advice even though the clinic was thoroughly burned the previous May by a house painter named Joseph Grace who opposed abortion He did an excellent job  150000 damage Miss Collins said He climbed a ladder broke in through a window poured kerosene throughout all our offices lit it climbed back down the ladder and drove away in his van Mr Grace is now in a Virginia state prison I was so devastated by the fire Miss Collins said I was so certain afterwards that our demonstrators would go low key to give our wounds time to heal Instead she said The picketing escalated It became so aggressive so unpredictable It was just chaotic Then came the bombing The damage was confined mainly to the ground floor office of the Sovran Bank where the bomb was placed against the outside wall Bank officials declined to discuss the bombing but as Miss Collins walked across the glassstrewn parking lot toward the bomb site that night a policeman was picking up a piece of board with messages on it Message for the ACLU On one side sprayed in red paint were the words Hilcrest Murders They misspelled Hillcrest  Miss Collins said On the other side were the letters AOG Miss Collins took that to mean Army of God the name used by some taking reponsibility for bombings around the country An explosion at the Pennsylvania Avenue legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union left a different message A bomb taped to the doorway exploded about 9 AM Saturday Nov 3 according to Jerry Berman the legislative counsel A secretary working in a distant room was unhurt We were in the dark about who did it or why because the message left behind was enigmatic Mr Berman said Someone wrote Wolverines on the wall Apparently the reference was to a particularly violent motion picture released last summer Red Dawn about a band of high school heroes who wage guerrilla war against an invader The high school students in the movie called themselves Wolverines But Federal agents concluded that the ACLU bomb strongly resembled those used in other explosions in the area On Saturday Jan 19 after two months of surveillance and searches of two homes and a rented warehouse space the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms arrested three Maryland men Michael Donald Bray 32 years old of Bowie a former Naval Academy cadet turned lay preacher Thomas E Spinks 37 also of Bowie and Kenneth William Shields of Laurel Two Suspects Released on Bail All were charged with conspiring to bomb the clinics They will not have a chance to enter a plea unless grand jury indictments are made But Robert Muse the Washington lawyer hired by Mr Bray said Hes going to enter a plea of not guilty if the grand jury acts A secretary for Richard Bardos the Federal assistant public defender appointed to represent Mr Spinks said that Mr Bardos has no comment at this time at the request of Mr Spinks And Fred Sinclair the private lawyer representing Mr Shields did not return repeated telephone calls Mr Bray and Mr Shields have been released on bail Mr Spinks is being kept in jail because a search of his house and rented storage space turned up hundreds of pounds of explosive material fuses and cylinder casings There were also heavy revolvers rifles and shotguns maps that pinpointed the sites of aborion clinics that had been bombed and the names and telephone numbers of Mr Bray and Mr Shields And among the papers according to Federal agents was a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook a bombmaking manual first published in the early 1970s The Cover of Newsweek Although Federal prosecutors have described the three men as fervently religious oponents of abortion not much is known of Mr Spinks and Mr Shields They were unfamiliar both to Chip Ward copastor of the Covenant Live Christian Community and to Mr Herlihy of the Pro Life Nonviolent Action Project the two groups that regularly picketed the Wheaton clinic before it was destroyed Nov 19 Mr Ward thinks the bombings negative though they are have actually helped the antiabortion cause by bringing attention to the issue All of a sudden its on the cover of Newsweek he said Its on 2020  But Mr Ward does know Mr Bray who has been active in the nonviolent protest movement He was one of the 46 people arrested at the Wheaton clinic two days before it was bombed A man who said he was jogging by the clinic the morning before it was bombed called a television station afterward to say that he recognized a man he had seen near the clinic The face on the newscast turned out to be Mr Brays Left Church in Dispute Hes told us in private that he didnt do it said Mr Herlihy who knows Mr Bray from repeated sitins and arrests with the Pro Life Nonviolent Action Project Now why would he say that if he had Married with three children Mr Bray worked as a 14000ayear lay assistant to Alan Ericksen pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Bowie Md until the congregation dropped his position in a philosophical dispute about a year ago Mr Bray then left taking 20 or 30 of the more conservative families with him Mr Ericksen said and the splinter congregation ordained him its pastor We basically are prolife here but not to the degree that perhaps Mike would like us to be Mr Ericksen said Mr Bray who began college as a cadet at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and then attended classes at the University of Maryland and Rockmont College in Colorado went to Grace Lutheran with a two year degree from the Denver Seminary a Baptist postgraduate theological school in Denver There is no support for violence at the Denver Seminary said the academic dean there Ralph Covell I do not like the phrase helping the cause  he said It brings it more forcefully to public attention I suppose But it accelerates the possibility of the polarization of society and in that way it has helped nobodys cause
STATE OF THE UNION: 'SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION';   TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT'S STATE OF UNION ADDRESS TO CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/07/us/state-union-second-american-revolution-transcript-president-s-state-union.html,Following is a transcript of President Reagans State of the Union Message last night as recorded by The New York Times Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Mr Speaker Mr President distinguished members of the Congress honored guests and fellow citizens I come before you to report on the state of our Union And I am pleased to report that after four years of united effort the American people have brought forth a nation renewed  stronger freer and more secure than before Four years ago we began to change  forever I hope  our assumptions about government and its place in our lives Out of that change has come great and robust growth  in our confidence our economy and our role in the world Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear We believe faith and freedom must be our guiding stars for they show us truth they make us brave give us hope and leave us wiser than we were Our progress began not in Washington DC but in the hearts of our families communities workplaces and voluntary groups which together are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God Four years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people greater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more of what they earned We did what we promised and a great industrial giant is reborn Tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth the strongest in 34 years a three year inflation average of 39 percent the lowest in 17 years and 73 million new jobs in two years with more of our citizens working than ever before Seeds for Future Success New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success For an America of wisdom that honors the family knowing that as the family goes so goes our civilization For an America of vision that sees tomorrows dreams in the learning and hard work we do today For an America of courage whose servicemen and women even as we meet proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help We have begun well But its only a beginning We are not here to congratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to finish what has not yet been done Were here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs safe neighborhoods and schools that truly teach Were here to speak for the American farmer the entrepreneur and every worker in industries fighting to modernize and compete And yes were here to stand and proudly so for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism for all who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and human happiness Proverbs tell us without a vision the people perish When asked what great principle holds our Union together Abraham Lincoln said Something in the Declaration giving liberty not alone to the people of this country but hope to the world for all future time Nation Is Poised for Greatness We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw My fellow citizens this nation is poised for greatness The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge  a Second American Revolution of hope and opportunity a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America enabling us to summon greater strength than weve ever known and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world at peace Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom There are no constraints on the human mind no walls around the human spirit no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect Already pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth In Europe theyre calling it the American Miracle Day by day we are shattering accepted notions of what is possible When I was growing up we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace Well today many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives In the late 1950s workers at the ATT semiconductor plant in Pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for 750 apiece They now produce over a million for less than a penny apiece Threshold of Great Advances New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery cut diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes reduce hospital costs dramatically and hold out new promise for saving human lives Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines increased worker productivity and is competitive once again We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more do more be more Our economy is not getting older and weaker its getting younger and stronger it doesnt need rest and supervision it needs new challenge greater freedom And that word  freedom  is the key to the Second American Revolution that we mean to bring about Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth Last year I asked Treasury Secretarythen Regan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down We have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels Lowincome families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder The Treasury Department has produced an excellent reform plan whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise We will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need We will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax preferences We will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent and possibly lower And we will propose reducing corporate rates while maintaining incentives for capital formation To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare we will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally exempt from Federal income tax To restore fairness to families we will propose increasing significantly the personal exemption And tonight I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker  I have to get used to saying that  to begin working with Congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles We will call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber Together we can pass this year a tax bill for fairness simplicity and growth making this economy the engine of our dreams and America the investment capital of the world So let us begin The Promise of Opportunity for All Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous pentup power of our economy But a Second American Revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all It is time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country This Government will meet its responsibility to help those in need But policies that increase dependency break up families and destroy selfrespect are not progressive theyre reactionary Despite our strides in civil rights blacks Hispanics and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power We have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in the abandoned corners of our land find jobs learn skills and build better lives This legislation is supported by a majority of you And Mr Speaker I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year And Tip you could make that a birthday present Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal We can help teenagers who have the highest unemployment rate find summer jobs so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures We will continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act which has a nearly two thirds job placement rate Credits and education and health care vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need Our Administration is already encouraging certain lowincome public housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings Its time all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership The Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom But states and localities many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions Well the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth More businesses will be started more investments made more jobs created and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes The best way to reduce Government spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity Each added percentage point per year of real GNP growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly 200 billion over five years Overall Spending to Be Frozen To move steadily toward a balanced budget we must also lighten Governments claim on our total economy We will not do this by raising taxes We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in spending by the Federal Government In our fiscal year 1986 budget overall Government program spending will be frozen at the current level it must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985 And three points are key First the social safety net for the elderly the needy the disabled and unemployed will be left intact Growth of our major health care programs Medicare and Medicaid will be slowed but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved Second we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped trained and ready professional corps National security is Governments first responsibility so in past years defense spending took about half the Federal budget Today it takes less than a third Weve already reduced our planned defense expenditures by nearly 100 billion over the past four years and reduced projected spending again this year You know we only have a military industrial complex until a time of danger and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy Spending for defense is investing in things that are priceless peace and freedom Third we must reduce or eliminate costly Government subsidies For example deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares but on Amtrak taxpayers pay about 35 per passenger every time an Amtrak train leaves the station Its time we ended this huge Federal subsidy Our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years Yet I know from visiting farmers many in great financial distress that we need an orderly transition to a marketoriented farm economy We can help farmers best not by expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental reforms keeping interest rates heading down and knocking down foreign trade barriers to American farm exports Protect Taxpayers From Government We are moving ahead with Grace Commission reforms to eliminate waste and improve Governments management practices In the long run we must protect the taxpayers from Government And I ask again that you pass as 32 states have now called for an amendment mandating the Federal Government spend no more than it takes in And I ask for the authority used responsibily by 43 Governors to veto individual items in appropriations bills Senator Mattingly has introduced a bill permitting a two year trial run of the lineitem veto I hope you will pass and send that legislation to my desk Nearly 50 years of Governmentliving beyond its means has brought us to a time of reckoning Ours is but a moment in history But one moment of courage idealism and bipartisan unity can change American history forever Sound monetary policy is key to longrunning economic strength and stability We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board seeking a steady policy that insures price stability without keeping interest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth Reducing unneeded red tape and regulations and deregulating the energy transportation and financial industries have unleashed new competition giving consumers more choices better services and lower prices In just one set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31 We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring us closer to energy independence Consistent with safety standards we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries we will soon end up legislation or send up legislation I should say to return Conrail to the private sector where it belongs And we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry Every dollar the Federal Government does not take from us every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger our lives more abundant our future more free New Possibilities in Space Research Our Second American Revolution will push on to new possibilities not only on earth but in the next frontier of space Despite budget restraints we will seek record funding for research and development We have seen the success of the space shuttle Now we are going to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise Within the next decade Americans and our friends around the world will be living and working together in space In the zero gravity of space we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving medicines it would take 30 years to make on earth We can make crystals of exceptional purity to produce super computers creating jobs technologies and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible As we do all this we will continue to protect our natural resources We will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program to continue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and the environment Now theres another great heritage to speak of this evening Of all the changes that have swept America the past four years none brings greater promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith freedom family work and neighborhood We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship renewed optimism and faith in our future love of country rediscovered by our young who are leading the way We have rediscovered that work is good in and of itself that it enobles us to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our jobs We have seen a powerful new current from an old and honorable tradition  American generosity From thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food production in Africa to millions volunteering time corporations adopting schools and communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home we have refound our values Private sector initiatives are crucial to our future I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy But no citizen need tremble nor the world shudder if a child stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer We ask you again Give children back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this country AntiAbortion Legislation Sought The question of abortion grips our nation Abortion is either the taking of human life or it isnt And if it is  and medical technology is increasingly showing it is  it must be stopped It is a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt We have room for these children we can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love And Tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn In the area of education were returning to excellence and again the heroes are our people not Government Were stressing basics of discipline rigorous testing and homework while helping children become computersmart as well For 20 years Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of our high school students went down But now they have gone up two of the last three years We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay Of all the changes in the past 20 years none has more threatened our sense of national wellbeing than the explosion of violent crime One does not have to be attacked to be a victim The woman who must run to her car after shopping at night is a victim the couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims as is the tired decent cleaning woman who cant ride a subway home without being afraid Compassion for Crime Victims We do not seek to violate rights of defendants But shouldnt we feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime For the first time in 20 years the crime index has fallen two years in a row weve convicted over 7400 drug offenders and put them as well as leaders of organized crime behind bars in record numbers But we must do more I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus laws and allow in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of Americans the use of the death penalty where necessary There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us are allowed to roam free It is time we restored domestic tranquility And we mean to do just that Just as were positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy were poised as never before to create a safer freer more peaceful world Our alliances are stronger than ever Our economy is stronger than ever We have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world  and all of these together are a great force for peace Since 1981 weve been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table Our negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of the American people All of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons are banned from this earth forever Defense and Meaningful Arms Pact Each member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement Your vote this spring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms reductions For the past 20 years we have believed that no war will be launched as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counter strike Well I believe there is a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war It is a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missiles It is the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age But its not well understood Some say it will bring war to the heavens  but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on earth Some say the research would be expensive Perhaps but it could save millions of lives indeed humanity itself Some say if we build such a system the Soviets will build a defense system of their own Well they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours a civil defense system where we have almost none and a research program covering roughly the same areas of technology that were now exploring And finally some say the research will take a long time Well the answer to that is Lets get started Harry Truman once said that ultimately our security and the worlds hopes for peace and human progress lie not in measures of defense or in the control of weapons but in the growth and expansion of freedom and selfgovernment Nourishing Freedom and Democracy And tonight we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few it is the universal right of all Gods children Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today It is in homes that freedom built Victories against poverty are greatest and peace most secure where people live by laws that insure free press free speech and freedom to worship vote and create wealth Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy and to communicate these ideals everywhere we can Americas economic success is freedoms success it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations Many countries in East Asia and the Pacific have few resources other than the enterprise of their own people But through low tax rates and free markets theyve soared ahead of centralized economies And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and implementing trade policy and will be studying potential changes in that process in the next few weeks We have seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism Tonight I ask all our trading partners developed and developing alike to join us in a new round of trade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economy  and to begin it in this next year There are more than three billion human beings living in third world countries with an average per capita income of 650 a year Many are victims of dictatorships that impoverish them with taxation and corruption Let us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these people climb from poverty on their own Role When Freedom Is Under Siege We cannot play innocents abroad in a world thats not innocent Nor can we be passive when freedom is under siege Without resources diplomacy cannot succeed our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace And I hope that you and the Congress will understand that dollar for dollar security assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense budget We must stand by all our democratic allies And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives  on every continent from Afghanistan to Nicaragua  to defy Sovietsupported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua with full Cuban Sovietbloc support not only persecutes its people the church and denies a free press but arms and provides bases for communist terrorists attacking neighboring states Support for freedom fighters is self defense and totally consistent with the OAS and UN Charters It is essential that the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America I want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to our own security Now tonight I have spoken of great plans and great dreams They are dreams we can make come true Two hundred years of American history should have taught us that nothing is impossible Ten years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family  part of the exodus that followed the fall of Saigon They came to the United States with no possessions and not knowing a word of English Ten years ago  the young girl studied hard learned English and finished high school in the top of her class and this May  May 22d to be exact  is a big date on her calendar  just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point I thought you might like to meet an American hero named Jean Nguyen Now theres someone else here tonight born 79 years ago She lives in the inner city where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin addicts The children born in withdrawal are sometimes even dropped on her doorstep She helps them with love Go to her house some night and maybe youll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor talking softly soothing a child in her arms Mother Hale of Harlem and she too is an American hero Jean Mother Hale your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is new again  anything is possible in America if we have the faith the will and the heart History is asking us once again to be a force for good in the world Let us begin  in unity with justice and love Thank you all very much Thank you Thank you for making the 35th time I have been 39 the happiest of them all
Reagan Sketches Legislative Goals for Next 4 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/07/politics/reagan-sketches-legislative-goals-for-next-4-years.html,WASHINGTON Feb 6  President Reagan urged the nation today to forge a second American revolution of hope and opportunity with an agenda of tax revision and economic growth and the elimination of the threat of nuclear war for the next four years In a State of the Union Message to Congress designed to set the legislative goals of his second term Mr Reagan sounded the same buoyant note that marked his triumphal Presidential campaign last year He said The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge a second American revolution of hope and opportunity a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America enabling us to summon greater strength that weve ever known and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the gold promise of human freedom in a world at peace Opportunity Is Theme Dominating his speech was the theme of opportunity for all Americans as the economy burgeons There are no constraints on the human mind no walls around the human spirit no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect Mr Reagan said Urging the nation to build on the economic as well as the foreignpolicy record of his first term Mr Reagan outlined a broad program that aimed to reduce the Federal budget deficits while helping the needy that cited the dream of banning nuclear weapons from earth while seeking a spacebased shield against missiles Alliances Are Called Strong Our alliances are stronger than ever our economy is stronger than ever Mr Reagan said We have resumed the historic role as a leader of the free world and all of these together are a great force for peace Addresssing the joint sesssion of Congress Mr Reagan spoke almost flawlessly and with good humor He was interrupted by applause 36 times by the legislators Supreme Court Justices the diplomatic corps and government officials who packed the House chamber Near the conclusion of the speech Mr Reagan unexpectedly introduced two women who he said symbolized the opportunity and values of the nation One of them Jean Nguyen a Vietnamese refugee who came to the United States 10 years ago is a West Point cadet scheduled to graduate in May The other Clara Hale is a 79 yearold Harlem resident who provides care for infants whose mothers are heroin addicts Both women were given prolonged standing ovations and Mrs Hale wept Heroes Mr Reagan said come from all walks of life Anything is possible Mr Reagan added if we have the faith the will and the heart Mr Reagans speech came two days after he sent Congress a Federal budget that contemplates overall spending of 9737 billion by shrinking numerous domestic programs while sustaining a buildup of the military Members of Congress from both parties have already begun criticizing the proposed military budget as too large In his speech Mr Reagan sought to evoke hope and optimism for all Americans and for those abroad who yearn for freedom Threaded through the message was a commitment to assisting blacks and members of other minority groups who have criticized his proposed cuts in domestic spending He also urged a historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth and he said the new Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d would meet with leaders of both parties to shape a tax measure Domestic Programs Cited Saying there must be no forgotten Americans Mr Reagan renewed his call for designation of decaying urban areas for tax benefits to assist blacks and members of other minority groups He then turned to face the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr Tip you could make that a birthday present said a smiling Mr Reagan who turned 74 today Other programs sought by Mr Reagan included training the jobless encouraging lowincome housing residents to own their own dwellings and suspending the minimum wage for teenagers who seek summer jobs Despite our strides in civil rights Mr Reagan said blacks Hispanics and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power Mr Reagan pointedly coupled arms control with a strong military Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table he said Reagan Presses for the MX In moving toward arms control Mr Reagan urged Congress to endorse a key weapon the MX missile Both the House and the Senate are to vote this spring on the procurement of 21 more of the missiles Beyond this Mr Reagan spoke in strong terms about his longrange plan to build a shield against incoming missiles It is the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age said Mr Reagan who conceded that its not well understood In foreign policy matters Mr Reagan deplored the Nicaraguan Government and said It is essential that the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America The President urged allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that seeks to spur economic development in the third world We cannot play innocents abroad in a world thats not innocent Mr Reagan said Nor can we be passive when freedom is under siege Without resources diplomacy cannot succeed our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace Mr Reagan also said the Administration will be studying potential changes in trade policy over the next few weeks and urged a new round of trade negotiations next year In keeping with his theme of a second American revolution Mr Reagan spoke of his commitment to new technology and industry as well as opening the frontier of space for research and development Mr Reagan intertwined his theme that the nation was poised for greatness with a discussion of the social causes that he has long supported He repeated his call for a ban on abortion and urged Congress to permit organized prayer in public schools He called for changes in the nations criminal code on the basis of an explosion of violent crime Mr Reagan urged the use of the death penalty where necessary Mr Reagan also repeated his calls for a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget and a proposal to empower the President to revamp item by item appropriations passed by Congress
ESSAY ;   AMERICAN REVOLUTION II,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/07/opinion/essay-american-revolution-ii.html,WASHINGTON Presidents as their years go by change their view of the State of the Union The first assessment is usually bad to leave room for improvement Jerry Ford went as far as to say candidly The State of the Union is not good It always gets better In 1982 with recession looming after his first year in office Ronald Reagan finessed the traditional requirement of putting the state in a nutshell by saying how it would one day be I can report to you tonight that in the near future the State of the Union and the economy will be better  much better  if we summon the strength to continue on the course that we have charted A year later with unemployment up and when Reaganomics was giving voodoo a bad name he was cautious The State of our Union is strong but our economy is troubled Last year the operative phrase in the address was optimistic as the re election campaign began I am pleased to report that America is much improved and there is good reason to hope that improvement will continue through the days to come In his fourth bite at the apple last night Mr Reagan reported that the American people have brought forth a nation renewed  stronger freer and more secure than before He could have described our state as one of general satisfaction but that would sound smug And smugness the President evidently realizes is not conducive to greatness His speech will not be reviewed in this space for its rhetoric as the second Inaugural was because a message to Congress is necessarily laden with programmatic weight However one passage about a Second American Revolution deserves attention because it summarizes the themes of his next term and if this is what he is trying to be remembered for we ought to think about it The phrase itself brings back painful memories Richard Nixon hailed a New American Revolution and that was supposed to be the theme of his Administration leading up to the Bicentennial But when it began to be referred to as NAR somebody pointed out to the President that it was Nelson Aldrich Rockefellers initials and that was the end of the New American Revolution Mr Reagan calls for a  revolution of hope and opportunity  Thats his way of describing work incentives through lower tax rates and more reliance on selfreliance but with a laudable secondterm emphasis on extending some measure of relative prosperity into the ranks of the poor Thus Jack Kemps enterprise zones offering tax breaks to businesses locating in poor neighborhoods get a push along with the teenage wage summer pay mistakenly opposed by organized labor     a revolution    pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space  He cannot mean more student loans or a larger Department of Education so we can read this as a reach for research into space defense and exploration Space suffered after the Kennedy era when the vogue was to claim that money was needed here on earth but the needs of hightechnology stimulus are fusing with the new space defense plans and a general interest in space stations and basicresearch adventure As the sign in the sky reads Watch this space     a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America     This is the traditional values pitch which the President believes in and which goes over well but which fortunately loses the name of action when it gets to specifics like amendments for school prayer and abortion or weakening the accuseds protection of habeas corpus      a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world at peace  This is a hardline idea in a soft sounding phrase Hawks speak of extending freedom which means challenging the notion that every nation now under Communism must remain so his beyond our shores will resonate in every conservative heart and hearthstone Every President is for peace but by coupling it with human freedom as his central foreignpolicy goal Mr Reagan shows he is not lusting after a quickie arms agreement He has told us he plans to stay on his course priority of defense over social spending no new taxes to solve the deficit danger much praise of patriotism God and family and most important a kind of belligerent push for peace through strength that seems to be working We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that is not innocent is more than a good line B
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/07/garden/hers.html,The Hers Column was designed as a forum for writing by women It is currently being written by Barbara Ehrenreich author of The Hearts of Men American Dreams and the Flight From Commitment QUITE apart from blowing up clinics and terrorizing patients the antiabortion movement can take credit for a more subtle and lasting kind of damage It has succeeded in getting even prochoice people to think of abortion as a moral dilemma an agonizing decision and related code phrases for something murky and compromising like the traffic in infant formula mix In liberal circles it has become unstylish to discuss abortion without using words like complex painful and the rest of the mealymouthed vocabulary of evasion Regrets are also fashionable and one otherwise feminist author writes recently of mourning each year following her abortion the putative birthday of her discarded fetus I cannot speak for other women of course but the one regret I have about my own abortions is that they cost money that might otherwise have been spent on something more pleasurable like taking the kids to movies and theme parks Yes that is abortions plural two in my case  a possibility that is not confined to the promiscuous the disorderly or the ignorant In fact my credentials for dealing with the technology of contraception are first rate I have a PhD in biology that is now a bit obsolescent but still good for conjuring up vivid mental pictures of zygotes and ova and I was actually paid at one point in my life to teach other women about the mysteries of reproductive biology Yet as every party to the abortion debate should know those methods of contraception that are truly safe are not absolutely reliable no matter how reliably they are used Many women like myself have felt free to choose the safest methods because legal abortion is available as a backup to contraception Anyone who finds that a thoughtless immoral choice should speak to the orphans of women whose wombs were performated by Dalkon shields or whose strokes were brought on by highestrogen birthcontrol pills I refer you to the orphans only because it no longer seems to be good form to mention women themselves in discussions of abortion In most of the antiabortion literature I have seen women are so invisible that an uninformed reader might conclude that fetuses reside in artificially warm tissue culture flasks or similar containers It must be enormously difficult for the antiabortionist to face up to the fact that real fetuses can only survive inside women who unlike any kind of laboratory apparatus have thoughts feelings aspirations responsibilities and very often checkbooks Anyone who thinks for a moment about womens role in reproductive biology could never blithely recommend adoption not abortion because women have to go through something unknown to fetuses or men and that is pregnancy From the point of view of a fetus pregnancy is no doubt a good deal But consider it for a moment from the point of view of the pregnant person if woman is too incendiary and feminist a term and without reference to its potential issue We are talking about a ninemonth bout of symptoms of varying severity often including nausea skin discolorations extreme bloating and swelling insomnia narcolepsy hair loss varicose veins hemorrhoids indigestion and irreversible weight gain and culminating in a physiological crisis which is occasionally fatal and almost always excruciatingly painful If men were equally at risk for this condition  if they knew that their bellies might swell as if they were suffering from endstage cirrhosis that they would have to go for nearly a year without a stiff drink a cigarette or even an aspirin that they would be subject to fainting spells and unable to fight their way onto commuter trains  then I am sure that pregnancy would be classified as a sexually transmitted disease and abortions would be no more controversial than emergency appendectomies Adding babies to the picture does not make it all that much prettier even if you are as I am a fool for short dimpled people with drool on their chins For no matter how charming the outcome of pregnancy that is allowed to go to term no one is likely to come forth and offer to finance its Pampers or pay its college tuition Nor are the opponents of abortion promising a guaranteed annual income subsidized housing national health insurance and other measures that might take some of the terror out of parenthood We all seem to expect the individual parents to shoulder the entire burden of supporting any offspring that can be traced to them and in the alltoocommon event that the father cannot be identified or has skipped town to avoid childsupport payments parent means mother When society does step in to help out a poor woman attempting to raise children on her own all that it customarily has to offer is some governmentsurplus cheese a monthly allowance so small it would barely keep a yuppie male in running shoes and the contemptuous epithet welfare cheat It would be far more reasonable to honor the survivors of pregnancy in childbirth with at least the same respect and special benefits that we give without a second thought to veterans of foreign wars But you will object I have greatly exaggerated the discomforts of pregnancy and the hazards of childbearing which many women undergo quite cheerfully This is true at least to an extent In my own case the case of my planned and wanted pregnancies I managed to interpret morning sickness as a sign of fetus tenacity and to find in the hypertrophy of my belly a voluptuousness ordinarily unknown to the skinny But this only proves my point A society that is able to make a good thing out of pregnancy is certainly free to choose how to regard abortion We can treat it as a necessary adjunct to contraception or as a vexing moral dilemma or as a form of homicide  and whichever we choose that is how we will tend to experience it So I will admit that I might not have been so calm and determined about my abortions if I had had to cross a picket line of earnest people yelling baby killer or if I felt that I might be blown to bits in the middle of a vacuum aspiration Conversely though we would be hearing a lot less about ambivalence and regrets if there were not so much liberal headscratching going on Abortions will surely continue as they have through human history whether we approve or disapprove or hem and haw The question that worries me is How is say a 16yearold girl going to feel after an abortion Like a convicted sex offender a murderess on parole Or like a young woman who is capable as the guidance counselors say of taking charge of her life This is our choice for biology will never have an answer to that strange and cabalistic question of when a fetus becomes a person Potential persons are lost every day as a result of miscarriage contraception or someones simple failure to respond to a friendly wink What we can answer with a minimum of throatclearing and moral agonizing is the question of when women themselves will finally achieve full personhood And that is when we have the right unquestioned and unabrogated to choose not to be pregnant when we decide not to be pregnant

REAGAN SKETCHES LEGISLATIVE GOALS FOR NEXT 4 YEARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/07/us/reagan-sketches-legislative-goals-for-next-4-years.html,President Reagan urged the nation today to forge a second American revolution of hope and opportunity with an agenda of tax revision and economic growth and the elimination of the threat of nuclear war for the next four years In a State of the Union Message to Congress designed to set the legislative goals of his second term Mr Reagan sounded the same buoyant note that marked his triumphal Presidential campaign last year He said The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge a second American revolution of hope and opportunity a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America enabling us to summon greater strength that weve ever known and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the gold promise of human freedom in a world at peace Opportunity Is Theme Dominating his speech was the theme of opportunity for all Americans as the economy burgeons There are no constraints on the human mind no walls around the human spirit no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect Mr Reagan said Urging the nation to build on the economic as well as the foreignpolicy record of his first term Mr Reagan outlined a broad program that aimed to reduce the Federal budget deficits while helping the needy that cited the dream of banning nuclear weapons from earth while seeking a spacebased shield against missiles Alliances Are Called Strong Our alliances are stronger than ever our economy is stronger than ever Mr Reagan said We have resumed the historic role as a leader of the free world and all of these together are a great force for peace Addresssing the joint sesssion of Congress Mr Reagan spoke almost flawlessly and with good humor He was interrupted by applause 36 times by the legislators Supreme Court Justices the diplomatic corps and government officials who packed the House chamber Near the conclusion of the speech Mr Reagan unexpectedly introduced two women who he said symbolized the opportunity and values of the nation One of them Jean Nguyen a Vietnamese refugee who came to the United States 10 years ago is a West Point cadet scheduled to graduate in May The other Clara Hale is a 79 yearold Harlem resident who provides care for infants whose mothers are heroin addicts Both women were given prolonged standing ovations and Mrs Hale wept Heroes Mr Reagan said come from all walks of life Anything is possible Mr Reagan added if we have the faith the will and the heart Mr Reagans speech came two days after he sent Congress a Federal budget that contemplates overall spending of 9737 billion by shrinking numerous domestic programs while sustaining a buildup of the military Members of Congress from both parties have already begun criticizing the proposed military budget as too large In his speech Mr Reagan sought to evoke hope and optimism for all Americans and for those abroad who yearn for freedom Threaded through the message was a commitment to assisting blacks and members of other minority groups who have criticized his proposed cuts in domestic spending He also urged a historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth and he said the new Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d would meet with leaders of both parties to shape a tax measure Domestic Programs Cited Saying there must be no forgotten Americans Mr Reagan renewed his call for designation of decaying urban areas for tax benefits to assist blacks and members of other minority groups He then turned to face the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr Tip you could make that a birthday present said a smiling Mr Reagan who turned 74 today Other programs sought by Mr Reagan included training the jobless encouraging lowincome housing residents to own their own dwellings and suspending the minimum wage for teenagers who seek summer jobs Despite our strides in civil rights Mr Reagan said blacks Hispanics and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power Mr Reagan pointedly coupled arms control with a strong military Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table he said Reagan Presses for the MX In moving toward arms control Mr Reagan urged Congress to endorse a key weapon the MX missile Both the House and the Senate are to vote this spring on the procurement of 21 more of the missiles Beyond this Mr Reagan spoke in strong terms about his longrange plan to build a shield against incoming missiles It is the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age said Mr Reagan who conceded that its not well understood In foreign policy matters Mr Reagan deplored the Nicaraguan Government and said It is essential that the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America The President urged allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that seeks to spur economic development in the third world We cannot play innocents abroad in a world thats not innocent Mr Reagan said Nor can we be passive when freedom is under siege Without resources diplomacy cannot succeed our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace Mr Reagan also said the Administration will be studying potential changes in trade policy over the next few weeks and urged a new round of trade negotiations next year In keeping with his theme of a second American revolution Mr Reagan spoke of his commitment to new technology and industry as well as opening the frontier of space for research and development Mr Reagan intertwined his theme that the nation was poised for greatness with a discussion of the social causes that he has long supported He repeated his call for a ban on abortion and urged Congress to permit organized prayer in public schools He called for changes in the nations criminal code on the basis of an explosion of violent crime Mr Reagan urged the use of the death penalty where necessary Mr Reagan also repeated his calls for a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget and a proposal to empower the President to revamp item by item appropriations passed by Congress
IN THE NATION;   MORALISM'S LIMITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/08/opinion/in-the-nation-moralism-s-limits.html,It is no virtue to be tolerant of abortion Prof Richard Baer of Cornell University has written to The New York Times Feb 5 1985 because the abortion debate concerns whether the fetus is a human being entitled to the protection of the law and is not just about personal preferences Professor Baer did not specifically defend the recent rash of bombings of abortion clinics But since he was responding to a Times editorial condemning the bombings his letter seems to me emblematic of a dubious moralism too often seen in American attitudes toward actions that by customary legal standards are criminal The abortionclinic bombings are a dramatic example Numerous justifications have been offered on grounds that those taking part in the bombings held deep moral convictions against abortion  hence were acting morally Professor Baer in my judgment quite speciously implicitly compared the bombings to the sitins of 25 years ago and argued that in those days civil rights activists regularly tried to embarrass and shame racists Even Thomas Herlihy of the Pro Life Nonviolent Action Project in Maryland told Dudley Clendinen of The Times that he could understand the bombers Theyre getting frustrated by legal abortion The pro life movement is reaching the pressurecooker stage Frustration is also the rationale most frequently cited by defenders of Bernhard Goetz who shot four young blacks two of them in the back on a New York subway train in December In this view Mr Goetz was justified not just because he felt threatened by the four young men but because  like many Americans  he was frustrated and angered by the prevalence of urban crime and the inability of police and courts to cope with it Thus Mr Goetzs violent response is seen as a needed and laudable moral protest against crime in the streets These defenses suggest if they do not specifically claim that the actions of the clinic bombers and Mr Goetz  I draw no other parallel between them  amount to civil disobedience rather like that of some civil rights protesters and peace activists of the 50s and 60s I see however a crucial distinction between what Id call moral vigilantism and civil disobedience Both are characterized by moral certainty as to the rightness of some particular view  whether against abortion and crime or for withdrawal from Vietnam or an end to segregation laws But moral vigilantism by my definition not only breaks the law but tends to a direct violent hence possibly lethal attack on the thing abhorred and is essentially destructive  not just physically but to the democratic process Civil disobedience also breaks the law but by nonviolent protest or assertion designed to call attention to and dramatize the abhorrence of the thing abhorred Civil disobedience is essentially constructive  an attempt to move the democratic process to needed action Neither moral vigilantism nor civil disobedience however can or should absolve the activist of the normal penalties of the law In the case of true civil disobedience it is precisely the human injustice of a legal penalty for a moral act that is counted upon to arouse the desired public indignation By no means could all the actions of the civil rights and peace movements be dignified let alone justified as civil disobedience whatever the grievances and motives of those involved  the looting and burning of other peoples property for example or the blowing up of a college building It nevertheless seems to me intellectually fallacious to equate bombing an abortion clinic with the civil rights sitins  in which the protesters themselves not only suffered the violence but also the legal penalties and offered no physical threat to anyone else It may be true that clinic bombers hope to embarrass and shame those who acquiesce in abortions but trying to do so by violence and destruction seems to me morally disreputable by comparison with the actions of those who marched nonviolently against Bull Connors police dogs and cattle prods often to be beaten and jailed themselves for their challenge to an unjust legal order And what about those Americans who from religious and moral motives are defying the Government in order to transport and shelter refugees from what they believe is violence and death in Central America Theyre not shooting and bombing  quite the opposite  although they risk indictment and jail Even in that case it seems to me the prime object should be to generate public revulsion against the Governments reluctance to lift the lamp and open the door In the long run more lives will be saved that way than by the operation of an underground railwayB
A SOUND WAY TO CURTAIL ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/08/opinion/a-sound-way-to-curtail-abortion.html,The Archbishop of Boston Bernard Law has pledged the resources of his diocese to help every woman who is contemplating an abortion  regardless of faith  to give birth to her child and raise it With this the church has once again taught liberals something about how to approach a complex issue pro choice or not the most effective way to curtail abortion is to support the welfare state  One does not need to be a pious Roman Catholic or indeed a Catholic at all to reject the arbitrary claim that human life begins at three months after conception Everybody knows that an embryo in the womb is genetically complete at conception there is no obvious reason to think this being any less human than the teenager whom we suspect will prove more nearly human when he leaves home True a teenager is not biologically dependent on mother But at no point during the first several years of life can a human baby survive without the loving care of adults If by human we mean reasonable then human life begins when the childs brain develops fully that is when he or she begins to use language  normally nine to 12 months after birth  A still more dubious way to justify abortion is to say as some strident feminists have that women are properly conceived as the proprietors of their persons  that we own our bodies and have a right over what goes in and comes out This way of thinking about ourselves makes sense in the restricted logic of property law but it hardly makes for moral clarity in the case of abortion An insurance policy will tell you the cost of one arm and one eye What is the value of life  Conservatives may be dismayed to learn that the shabby materialism behind this particular defense of abortion originated not with godless socialists but with the seventeenthcentury defenders of market relations  John Locke and his successors the political economists  whose rhetoric frankly justified men and women selling their laboring power to whomever could meet the going price Accordingly the classical economists defined getting an education as making an addition to ones stock of capital Why not then conceive of pregnancy as a threat to ones investment in ones self  Though the church disagrees uncertainty persists regarding just when human life gets started which is why various religions and philosophers are at odds regarding the moment after which an abortion may not be performed Uncertainty alone should be enough to justify a womans right to decide for herself To be pro choice is not necessarily to concede that there is no other life at stake than the mothers however It is merely to concede that there are times when a sane woman says plausibly tragically That life or mine No outsider least of all the Congress should presume to legislate about her distress  One right way to make a moral argument is to ask about human potential and how can we reach it what is the task of the commonwealth in helping each of us to reach ours Pro lifers are wrong to want to interfere directly in others lives but they are hardly wrong to perceive that one and a half million abortions a year are not all the result of genuine tragedy In many cases abortions result from cavalier attitudes toward birth control or preoccupation with our own ambitions careers  and incomes  Recently a talkshow psychologist in Boston encouraged one wavering 18yearold to go ahead and get an abortion so that she could proceed to get a college degree She ought to find out who she was before having a child In contrast the church has said rightly Your life is long There will be many unexpected demands to complicate it You cannot know now what will be important to you in 20 years Your children will show both you and your husband who you are The Boston church has added in effect If in the meantime you need financial aid we will help To honor life we as a society must above all make affordable that which brings out the best in any child food housing clothing health care day care public schools safe streets  also museums concerts libraries and public television That is after all is what is important in shaping human life Ronald Reagan may believe this but he doesnt say it Liberals should

REAGAN HAS OPPONENTS PLAYING BY HIS RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/weekinreview/reagan-has-opponents-playing-by-his-rules.html,PRESIDENT REAGAN paused a few minutes in the chambers of the Speaker of the House last Wednesday night before making his State of the Union Address Typically he passed the time not in solitary reflection but swapping jokes and stories with Congressional leaders downing a glass of Perrier to wet his throat Others found him in an easy genial mood That infectious buoyancy soon gave a lift to his performance before the television cameras and bolstered his confident promise of a second American Revolution In a classic bit of political theater the President laid claim to having changed the nations assumptions about government  forever I hope Indeed despite the Republican squabbling over just how much to cut from the Pentagon budget the underlying reality is that Reagan politics have transformed the political debate and the nations agenda Mainstream Democrats are talking the Presidents game Virtually no one proposes new programs or expanding government Democrats like Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington state who is the House whip suggest Mr Reagan is actually less bent on cutting deficits than on shrinking the size of government and is using the huge deficits as leverage to force Democrats into retreat The most stunning evidence of success and the most startling shift came last week from House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr a perennial defender of Federal programs since the New Deal Although he sniped at the President for not levelling with the public on deficits the Speaker agreed that there are many areas where the Federal Government can save money without hurting the needy In private he groused about mayors and governors who lobby for continued Federal aid while cutting their local budgets and taxes He said he was willing to slash billions from revenue sharing and grants to local governments for community development and urban projects He has told fellow Democrats they must shed the image of being kneejerk defenders of spending and weak on defense Whats more Democrats seem to be learning from Mr Reagan the political cost of being too identified with Washington and they are out to change that The notion that were the Washington party is killing us said Christopher Matthews the Speakers spokesman Were portrayed somehow as the government party even though we havent had the White House for most of the past 20 years To cast themselves more visibly as a party of the people the Democraticled House Budget Committee will travel to six cities for public hearings Likewise the Democrats used their 30minute televised response to the State of the Union Address to show themselves listening to disgruntled voters and promising to make changes On foreign policy Mr Reagans message had less immediate impact in moving Congress to revive aid to the Nicaraguan rebels or to keep alive the MX missile But Speaker ONeill is talking about making sure American arms negotiators bargain from strength The Reagan vision of future security based on strategic defense has begun to alter the terms of the nuclear debate Former Defense Secretary James R Schlesinger last week dismissed the notion of an impenetrable astrodome defense for American cities as impossible to achieve Nonetheless the Reagan vision has revived an idea shelved a decade ago a defense for American missile fields to blunt the threat of a Soviet first strike That may persuade many Democrats as well as Republicans to finance the research the President wants For Republicans too the State of the Union Address was a telltale moment For the optimistic mood President Reagan conveyed the bullish themes he set out the policy emphasis he chose foreshadowed much about the Reagan Presidency in its second term Mr Reagan finished his election campaign last year without a clear agenda and he has been caught ever since in an internal struggle over political priorities and more broadly over the soul of the Republican Party Traditional pragmatic Republicans like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the new Senate majority leader and David A Stockman the Presidents budget director have urged Mr Reagan to concentrate first and foremost on the austerity economics of heavy budgetcutting and to defer other initiatives But the Young Turk group led by Representatives Jack Kemp of upstate New York and Newt Gingrich of Georgia have warned that such a bad news strategy clashed with the good news campaign that won Mr Reagan a landslide As fervent supplyside ideologues they proclaim growth as the best cure for deficits and populist tax revision as the best issue for building a longterm Republican majority The President chose sides in his State of the Union Address His Budget Message on Monday with its call for 475 billion in cuts in projected spending echoed the pragmatists But on Wednesday his glowing vision of an America poised for greatness and his emphasis on change of the income tax system came down solidly on the side of New Right growtheconomics Glossing over pain in the farm sector Mr Reagan celebrated the American miracle of economic recovery The best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth the President declared ignoring the conflict with his Budget Message which had projected a 144 billion deficit in 1988 even assuming solid growth and large cuts this year More fundamentally the President cast himself as a futurist He limned the dazzling dream of a new hightech revolution powered by supercomputers lasers and the pure efficiency of industry operating in the zero gravity of manned space stations His most expansive promise was a second American Revolution of hope and opportunity a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space Overriding the cautious estimate of Senator Dole that tax reform could not be completed this year he gave the goahead for talks with the Democrats on a bipartisan package He touted other pet New Right initiatives like enterprise zones healthcare vouchers and constitutional amendments against abortion and for voluntary school prayer In the audience Senator Dole seemed to be listening painfully Afterward he acknowledged being disappointed that the President had not pressed hard on the deficit issue Mr Kemp was ebullient That wasnt Old Guard probusiness Republicanism he trumpeted It was a more populist growthoriented Republicanism It seeks policy changes that encourage expansion even in depressed areas of the country In political terms Mr Kemp saw the President stealing the potent popular Democratic strategy patented in 1960 by John F Kennedy  get America moving again
"TO SOME, IT'S WHAT HE DIDN'T SAY THAT COUNTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/weekinreview/to-some-it-s-what-he-didn-t-say-that-counts.html,WASHINGTON AS the President closed his State of the Union Address hailing the accomplishments of Jean Nguyen a West Point cadet who is a Vietnamese refugee the members of Congress rose to their feet and applauded vigorously They were not only cheering for Miss Nguyen They were also cheering the showmanship of a President who was celebrating his 74th birthday with a typical star turn But the aura of good feeling was punctured by the lawmakers less kindly reaction to the Presidents specific proposals Most Democrats sat in stony silence as he called for legislation to ban abortions legalize school prayer and restore the death penalty There were scattered chuckles when he endorsed the MX missile calling it as he insists on doing the Peacekeeper And there was laughter in the chamber when he advocated a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget As Representative Mary Rose Oakar an Ohio Democrat said afterward under such an amendment President Reagan would have violated the law every year of his first term Indeed as the key players in both parties on Capitol Hill analyzed the Presidents speech and the details of the Budget Message that was formally made public two days earlier many expressed disappointment that Mr Reagan had failed to deal more directly with the major issue confronting the Congress budget deficits that could swell past 200 billion this year In his radio address on Saturday the President said he had no intention of sitting at the starting gate in the budget battle But many lawmakers believe that when the President refused to consider a slower growth rate for the Pentagon budget or a freeze on the costofliving increase in Social Security benefits he took a seat on the bench This Administration has opted out of real choices said Representative Vic Fazio of California a senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee Theyve thrown the ball to us Some members of Congress however were more willing to catch the ball than others Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the majority leader told reporters last week that even if the President was not ready to go along Senate Republicans would include a Social Security benefit freeze in their deficit reduction package which they hope will trim at least 50 billion from projected spending levels The Reagan budget would cut 39 billion Senator Pete V Domenici the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee was equally blunt when he told the National Press Club that the time for rhetoric on the budget issue was over and real tough medicine would have to be swallowed Even a group of six Republicans on the House Budget Committee wrote to Defense Secretary Caspar W Weinberger suggesting the possibility of freezing Pentagon spending for a year The differences between the Senate leadership and the White House reflected two factors The Senators are convinced that if budget deficits continue unchecked interest rates could rise choking off the economic recovery Mr Reagan seems to side with young Republicans in the House led by Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York who consider the Senators hysterical on the subject and argue that vigorous economic growth will alleviate the shortfall Moreover as Mr Dole notes Mr Reagan never has to face the voters again But 22 Republican Senators including him are up for reelection in 1986 And they are afraid that the economy will nosedive that fall defeating incumbents and losing their party the Senate Among Democrats the response was more cautious Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House said that voters seem mesmerized by the President But the same could be said of the Speakers own party which seems intimidated by Republicans attacks and determined to shed its big spender image Even Mr ONeill the apostle of government aid to the needy said that Washington had no obligation to aid cities and states with budget surpluses Instead Mr ONeill is leading the Democrats in a coordinated campaign to blame Mr Reagan for the budget deficits I think its time the American people opened their eyes said the Speaker Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the Senate minority leader said that the Presidents budget doesnt square with his rhetoric Neither leader offered alternatives On the ground that all budget choices are tough and unpopular the Democrats strategy at least for now is to publicize Mr Reagans plan not produce their own Accordingly Representative William H Gray 3d the Pennsylvania Democrat who now heads the Budget Committee announced that his panel is taking to the road during Congresss Lincolns Birthday recess this week One purpose of the panels public hearings is to convince people that Mr Reagans policies have created the budget crisis The other is to focus attention on the sharp cuts the White House has proposed in student loans Medicare and other programs that benefit middleclass voters who backed the Republicans last fall By concentrating on cutting such programs this year Mr Reagan might be giving his opponents an opening The Congressional Democrats strategy is to come swooping in later on with proposals to reverse those cuts and to pose as heroes Indeed while most legislators preached the gospel of deficit reduction last week many were quick to oppose specific cuts in their favorite programs from national parks to farm subsidies from mining inspectors to mass transit By weeks end Mr Domenici acknowledged that the Congressional budgetcutting effort could be reaching gridlock Can we do it he asked I dont know
CHINA ASSAILS U.S. ON POPULATION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/world/china-assails-us-on-population-funds.html,A Chinese official protested the Reagan Administrations decision to withhold a 23 million contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities today saying the action was unreasonable and based on false information about Chinas birthcontrol policies The protest came after the announcement in Washington this week that the American money would be withheld because of concerns that it might go to support forced abortions in China The Chinese reaction took the form of an item on the official New China News Agency that quoted an unnamed official of the State Family Planning Commission as saying that not a single US dollar has gone toward abortion in China and that in any case there were no forced abortions here The Chinese Government always insisted that family planning must be based on voluntary lines the Chinese official was quoted as saying Legitimate Right of a Woman The news item added The official said that abortion in China was only provided at the request of the woman after contraceptive failure or for health reasons This is the legitimate right of a woman which therefore should be fully respected he said The insistent tone of the press agency item reflected the sensitivity that has developed here over the Governments policy of trying to limit each family to only one child Though defended on the basis that China will never defeat poverty until it curbs its population growth the policy has stirred widespread restiveness particularly among the 800 million peasants The official quoted by the press agency implied that the United States was trying to interfere in Chinas internal affairs a serious allegation in Chinese diplomatic parlance We hold consistently that the population strategy and policy of each country should be formulated by its own government according to its own conditions and that this should be respected by other countries he said This is a matter of the sovereign rights of every country Awaiting Careful Review The dispute developed when Kate Semerad a spokesman for the United States Agency for International Development announced that the United States contribution to the United Nations program was being held up pending a careful review of the program She said the agency wanted to be sure that no United Nations funds were going to forced abortions in China Subsequently Rafael M Salas of the Philippines head of the United Nations program offered an assurance in New York that none of his agencys funds would be used for abortions in China or elsewhere Mr Salas said that his office had already assured the United States that none of their money would go toward programs that the Reagan Administration opposed The Chinese official quoted here took a similar position saying that China had told an international conference on population matters in Mexico last August that no American money would go toward abortion here The official said that the United States had pledged itself at the conference to actively support world population activities but that its action this week goes against this promise

"ABOUT MEN;

THE WAYS OF A WIMP",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/magazine/about-men-the-ways-of-a-wimp.html,is the author of the prizewinning novel Year of the French    THE WORD WIMP has in the last few years achieved a baleful centrality in our political and cultural discourse He is an indecisive sort of fellow burdened by an extravagant sense of complexities and difficulties disinclined to act with fierce swift and unreflecting resolve Like many of a cultures controlling terms however it neither possesses nor requires precise definition We know what a wimp is and why it is awful to be one and awful for a nation that it should contain many of them But no wimp has presented himself for close inspection presumably because wimps almost by definition lack the necessary courage I suspect that I myself am one I cannot drive a car and am bored by sports When my wife drives us to a dinner party during a World Series she coaches me in the names of the contending teams By midnight I have forgotten them The novelists who have meant most to me are Jane Austen Proust and Henry James I cherish the music of Schumann and Ravel and the paintings of Watteau and Monet Such a list of accusing preferences could be extended endlessly but would not speak to the immediate point At the moment the real charge against the wimp is political and here too I stand condemned Specific affiliation is not here at issue I am a liberal Democrat but there are also many Republican wimps although they are not admired by the current stridently victorious wing of their party Political habits of mind the moral sentiments of politics are at issue Thus I believe that no national priority is higher than that of attending to those who have been damaged or neglected by our society  the poor the ill the old those maimed both by our present racism and by the consequences of our history of racism I detest capital punishment which I regard as a compact of violence made by our society with its murderers I am uneasy about abortion but believe that the matter should be entrusted to the consciences of pregnant women rather than to the remorseless dogmatism of celibate archbishops The new patriotism seems to me a shrill and vulgar hysteria when contrasted with the old patriotism of Jefferson and Madison Dr Johnson notwithstanding I believe that patriotism is not the last but the first refuge of a scoundrel  first because it is easy and can assert itself in the confidence of mob support There is indeed a deep malaise in our society and the new patriotism is not its cure but rather one of its symptoms I am also what the selfproclaimed moral majority calls a humanist My college readings in Erasmus and Montaigne long ago instructed me to regard that word as an honorable one but then I was also instructed by Thucydides that words lose their meanings in times of cultural crisis In religious matters however I am indeed what the moral majority intends by that term  I am an agnostic and assume that whatever value human life possesses is that with which human beings are able to endow it What I have said may seem confident and poised even arrogant and therefore not wimplike But in fact I lack such confidence Like most wimps I regard matters of the spirit and questions of morality art and political choice as complex and contradictory ambiguous and shaded As might be inferred if not from what I have said then from my Irish surname I am no admirer of Oliver Cromwell but I greatly admire his letter of 1650 to the Church of Scotland I beseech you in the bowels of Christ think it possible you may be mistaken Literature and teaching the two crafts that I profess have nurtured this indecisiveness Literature grants us access to diverse modes of being and feeling alternative ways of thinking and doing And teaching is in part the task of repeating year after year to class after class the injunction of Cromwell to the Church of Scotland With the perverse courtesy of my breed I acknowledge that an impatience with the wimp is not a whim of the moment but rather lies deep within the grain of our national culture But not deeper than the doubts and hesitations the heresies and recessions of the wimp Hawthorne and Melville are to be numbered among the great American wimps and the voice of the wimp can he heard murmuring beneath the manly assurances of Whitman and Twain and Frost Perhaps and I put forward the idea with an appropriate tentativeness a dash of the wimp is necessary if one is to come to a full consciousness of the powers and paradoxes of the American experience I am puzzled however by the assumption that the wimp can easily be thrust aside or can be derided with impunity Both art and history argue to the contrary Hamlet is literatures supreme example of the wimp The native hue of his resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought He is hesitant indecisive oppressed by an awareness of alternative possibilities He is skeptical invents and reinvents his world and the play in which he appears is so ambiguous that scholars argue as to whether its prevailing spiritual tone is Protestant or Roman Catholic He displays an unmanly love of language Worse yet he is a wit sarcastic sardonic playful  the very quality that revealed to American eyes the wimpiness of Adlai Stevenson and Eugene McCarthy But when his world and his being goad him into action he litters Denmark with corpses  stabbing one man to death through an arras sending to their deaths two others and killing a final two by his sword And with his dying breath he names his successor and sets in order the affairs of his kingdom An extreme example It requires translation into the native and the immediate idiom America seems to have decided for the moment that it is unhealthy to question too closely our national purposes and intentions that it is effete and debilitating to nourish scruples and reservations that it is unmanly to perceive our circumstances as complex and infinitely delicate But it requires a sinewy and muscular strength of spirit to live within uncertainties and complexities The true American wimp may not be the intellectual but rather to borrow a phrase from Yeats one that ruffles in a manly pose for all his timid heart

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: CUOMO'S CARE OVER WORDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/12/nyregion/reporter-s-notebook-cuomo-s-care-over-words.html,The diary Governor Cuomo keeps every day is painstakingly handwritten The lined paper is smudged with deletions speckled with notes Mr Cuomo is meticulous about words A lawyer by training he writes with the specificity of a legal brief although without the dryness of that sort of prose The care is evident not only when he writes down his thoughts for himself but equally when he speaks in public Mario Cuomo may be the most dangerous man in America The National Review argued in a recent article The conservative magazine said Mr Cuomos graceful argumentation could revive liberalism Hes great at conceiving things in metaphor said Peter Quinn the Governors speech writer  The wagon train The tale of two cities And the family  the family is everything There is no conflict between substance and style Mr Quinn said If you cant say it right he said then it doesnt exist The Governor he said feels the same way Nothing goes out of here unless he sees it said Martin Steadman the Governors press secretary and a former reporter Hes better than most editors Every change he makes is an improvement I told him no one would listen to the Notre Dame speech said Mr Quinn recalling his reaction when Mr Cuomo decided to use an invitation to a forum at that Roman Catholic university to challenge the view propounded by Archbishop John J O Connor of New York that public officials who are Catholic must oppose abortion in their governmental roles I said Mr Quinn went on that no one would hear the words All theyd hear is you arguing with the Archbishop and no one would like it But the Governor told him Ive got to straighten this out So they volleyed drafts back and forth for weeks And he was right and I was wrong Mr Quinn said He got them to listen to the words Focus on the Governors care with words deepened this week as he prepared the Chubb lecture he is to give at Yale University on Friday He is putting the final touches on the speech he will deliver in New Haven which according to his aides will be the third in the series of major statements he began at the Democratic National Convention and continued at the University of Notre Dame The Governors State of the State address on Jan 9 which opened the 1985 legislative session was crammed as committeecomposed speeches of that sort must be with dullsounding departmental proposals But there was one eloquent line Looking around the jammed Assembly chamber Mr Cuomo reminded todays politicians that some of their predecessors had been giants He did not use the obvious phrase History was made in this room Rather he said gracefully that the future once happened here He was clearly summoning the spirit of the New Deal and its creator Franklin D Roosevelt a New York Governor before he was President But Mr Cuomo is in a conservative posture these days focusing on phraseology that might appeal to a national audience disenchanted with decades of liberal cant So after the news accounts about his speech appeared his rewritetherecord team went into action It was really a conservative speech one emissary argued pointing to proposals for tax cuts and reducing the state debt Top Cuomo aides met for several hours one afternoon to decide in what order they should orchestrate leaks  advance news stories  about the proposed state budget The theory is to get a series of news stories about the budget instead of the one inevitable monster on the day it appears Unable to agree how to do it they decided not to do it Then the Governor did it himself and it turned out that his words while as precise as ever were not totally accurate He went on a television news program and said he was proposing a 12 billion tax cut A few days later he elevated the figure to 21 billion I remember exactly how it happened said Mr Steadman the Governors press secretary We had a briefing complete with charts and they showed that this tax cut we had been talking about would be 320 million the first year 620 million the second and 12 billion the third And someone asked Well if its 21 billion why have we been calling it 12 billion and Wayne Diesel said thats the way budget people always did it that the phrase when fully implemented was understood Mr Diesel is the State Budget Director It occurred to Mr Cuomo that the phrase was not so understood by many people himself included So he decided to change it the next time out Mr Steadman said Ever since the Governors wellreceived keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention there has been talk of a possible Cuomo run for the White House Last fall Mr Cuomo ruminated during an interview that if he ran for reelection as Governor in 1986 it would be a signal that he would not run for President in 1988 Since then his aides have been trying to figure how to take it back At a forum the other day the Governor was talking about fiscal reform and someone asked what might happen to his longterm program some years from now when he was no longer the Governor The Governor paused Was the questioner assigning him two full terms in Albany Well wasnt that what the Governor had said The questioner nodded I said I didnt want to run for President Mr Cuomo said I did nt ask you to believe me
PERSINAL HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/13/garden/persinal-health.html,UNLIKE most men millions of women regularly visit doctors even when they believe they are perfectly healthy They go for checkups and assistance with regard to their gynecological  sexual and reproductive  health As a result a womans interaction with the doctor who provides her gynecological care is likely to be the most important medical encounter of her adult life This is the doctor who may help her with contraception infertility prenatal care childbirth menstrual difficulties breast and hormonal abnormalities genitourinary infections and other problems and needs Even at its best gynecological care can be awkward sometimes it is embarrassing Neither the women nor their doctors who are usually men are comfortable talking about sexrelated problems particularly when those matters are likely to be subject to moral judgment Indeed the very posture of the gynecological examination  the woman lying down with her feet up with the doctor poking inside her the actions hidden from sight by the obligatory sheet  is the source of emotional discomfort When in addition the doctor appears to be insensitive or uncaring or too busy to explain what is happening and answer questions the stage is set for suspicion and animosity In response to criticisms that have been levied largely by participants in the feminist movement gynecologists have been trying to modify their attitudes and behavior They have been helped by articles in professional journals and medical magazines by discussions at medical meetings and by listening to patients advice both subtle and direct The gynecologist however is not the only one responsible for the quality of the doctorpatient relationship and the thoroughness of the care given Patients play a critical role They should know first how to choose a qualified and empathetic physician when and how often to see the doctor what to expect from the visit and what to say and do before during and after an examination Choosing the Doctor A gynecologist has been specially trained in womens sexual and reproductive matters and should be board certified in obstetrics and gynecology Gynecological care also may be provided by family physicians or internists Currently about 12 percent of practicing gynecologists are women although this ratio is changing as more women enter the field of the current firstyear residents in gynecology 40 percent are women These days many women search for gynecologists who are women Too often they discover that the sex of the doctor has little or no effect on the doctors attitude or approach probably because all gynecologists undergo the same training Part of that training involves learning to remain detached from ones patients as does all medical training When the care involves so personal a subject as gynecology the need for detachment may be exaggerated Whether the doctor is a man or a woman the patient must feel comfortable and unhurried the patient must be able to discuss highly per sonal matters without undue embarrassment or fear about confidentiality Good gynecologists should explain what the examination entails and what it shows If medication is prescribed they should tell patients what it is what it should do and what side effects it might cause If an invasive diagnostic test or treatment is advised they should explain why a less complicated procedure is inappropriate When surgery is recommended good gynecologists will welcome a patients desire for a second independent medical opinion Keep in mind that among the operations most often performed and most often unnecessary are hysterectomies DandCs and breast biopsies Preparing for a Visit Do not douche for two to three days before an examination Be prepared to answer questions about your personal and family medical history and to give a detailed account of any current problems You should be asked about diseases that may run in your family and about your menstrual and reproductive history including any abortions You should know how long your menstrual period usually lasts when your last one began and how heavily you bleed Teenage patients whose first menstrual period seems to be delayed may be asked when other women in their immediate family began menstruating If you have questions for the doctor write them down before the visit If you find some matters embarrassing to mention rehearse talking about them with a friend or relative or in front of the mirror Write down the doctors answers or instructions while you are in the office If necessary repeat to the doctor what you have been told to be sure you understand A national health survey showed that the typical visit to a gynecologist lasts only 13 minutes which suggests haste on the part of either doctor or patient Do not worry about taking up the doctors time Your health is at stake and you are paying for the doctors care and attention The Examination After the nurse or medical assistant takes your history you should be asked to undress and put on a gown Another woman either a nurse or assistant is likely to be present during the examination if the examining physician is a man  both for the doctors protection and for your comfort Before the physical examination begins you may be asked to provide a urine sample to be checked for signs of infection and excess sugar The examination will be far more comfortable if your bladder is empty The doctor should check your face for acne or unusual hairiness a possible sign of hormone excess your neck for enlargement of the thyroid gland and your breasts for lumpiness or growths You should be shown how to examine your own breasts which you should do monthly preferably right after your period or if you are postmenopausal at the same time each month Your blood pressure should be taken and if you have not had your blood checked recently a blood sample may be taken as a check for anemia and other ailments Next you will be asked to lie in the lithotomy position  on your back knees bent and feet in stirrups  which is the only way the doctor can properly examine a womans reproductive organs The doctor will first check the external organs looking for normal development abnormal growths or signs of infection Then to permit an examination of the vaginal walls and cervix a metal instrument called a speculum that opens like a ducks bill will be inserted to spread apart the vaginal wall If you relax the muscles of the vaginal opening during this examination it should not be painful the only sensation should be one of mild pressure that is not uncomfortable With the speculum in place the doctor will take a swab of the cervix for a Pap smear which is a test for precancerous changes and perhaps will take a specimen to test for an infection if you have shown symptoms of one Once the speculum is removed the doctor should don a sterile glove and insert one or two lubricated fingers into the vaginal opening With the other hand the doctor will press on your lower abdomen This bimanual examination positions the internal organs so that abnormal size or growths can be detected In a related procedure one gloved finger may be placed in the rectum and another in the vagina Again if you remain relaxed through these procedures they should not be painful Tell the doctor if any procedure causes pain After the Examination Once you have dressed the doctor should see you in the office and review all findings and recommendations You should also be told when to return for another checkup Whether reminded or not a wise woman will see her gynecologist at least once a year two or three visits a year may be advised if there is a condition that needs watching For pregnant women visits are monthly For many healthy women the gynecologist is the main contact with the medical care system and they tend to consult this specialist for all sorts of problems rashes headaches coughs depression what have you But the gynecologist is not the best qualified physician to treat these conditions If you have confidence in your gynecologist ask to be referred to a more appropriate specialist The First Visit A NUMBER of circumstances can be the occasion for a girls first visit to a gynecologist symptoms of an infection in the vagina or urinary tract an unusual discharge a sticky discharge early in adolescence is usually normal abdominal pains a girls desire to know whether she is normal injury to the vaginal area delayed start of the menses loss of periods or delayed development of breasts and pubic hair Dr Karen Hein writing in the medical magazine Rx Being Well suggests that it is usually best if a girl sees the doctor alone so she knows that what she says will be confidential It may even be best if she sees another gynecologist than the one her mother uses Dr Hein cautions parents not to pressure the doctor into doing a pelvic exam to confirm a girls virginity since this cannot be reliably determined
COUNSELING FOR MEN AT ABORTION CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/13/garden/counseling-for-men-at-abortion-clinics.html,Three years ago Darrel Cummings sat in an abortion clinic waiting to join his pregnant girlfriend for counseling before the abortion When he asked the receptionist about the delay and wondered where his girlfriend was he was told she had already had the abortion and no he could not join her I felt we had been through the whole decisionmaking process together and then suddenly we were separated Mr Cummings said And there was no one at the clinic particularly concerned about that element Today Mr Cummings is one of a small group of counselors in the country who deal exclusively with men at abortion clinics and he is one of an even smaller group of counselors who are themselves men Several years ago experts were predicting an increase in the number of men accompanying partners sisters daughters and friends to abortion clinics and they also predicted a concerted effort among the clinics to counsel those men About 16 million abortions are performed annually in the United States according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute a public policy group specializing in the issues of family planning and reproductive health Surveys have shown that the majority of men involved in the abortion process have wanted and supported counseling The experts predictions seem to have been realized only in part No national statistics have been reported but a spokesman for the National Abortion Federation said members have observed an increase in the number of men at clinics Ive been involved in familyplanning services for a decade and a half now said Daniel Pellegrom who was until recently the executive director of Planned Parenthood Federation of Maryland The number of men who accompany women into clinics has expanded in a pretty startling way But there has been no concommitant increase in counseling services for the men Rather clinics are debating the need for counseling and what such a service should provide Some experts argue for example that in these circumstances men are best counseled by other men Bill Baird director of three Bill Baird Centers two on Long Island and one in Boston strongly advocates counseling services for men His abortion clinic in Hempstead LI he said was one of the first in the country to encourage men to be with their partners during the abortion and 90 percent of the men who enter the clinic choose to do so By contrast he said at some clinics there is considerable sexism against men  and its not even conscious just insensitivity to the needs of those who come in The Womens Medical Center in Washington the clinic at which Mr Cummings works does not permit men to be present during the actual abortion Weve never had a case where a man wanted to go through the procedure Mr Cummings said Men are not allowed in the recovery room he added because other women might object to their presence With counseling so many other needs are taken care of that going into the procedure and the recovery room are the least in term of priorities he said Administrators at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Baltimore that provides a male counselor for men on the days abortions are performed said the counseling needs of men are similar to those of women in some respects and that the counselors skill is more important than his or her sex Men also go through the grieving the sense of loss and may also experience a lot of the ambivalence that women do about becoming a parent said Carol Crane coordinator of counseling services at the clinic Miss Crane said she believes the counseling needs of men and women begin to differ when the men realize what little control they have over the final decision and procedure and feel alienated and often resentful The Womens Medical Center is one of the few clinics in the country where it is mandatory for both men and women who enter the clinic to go through counseling Sometimes its threatening to men because they are not accustomed to having to deal with an emotional issue like abortion Mr Cummings said They are going to have to come into the room with me and acknowledge that they dont know anything about birth control or how they got there The most difficult part of counseling he said is when some men begin to recognize their inability to communicate what it is they are feeling because they are men and that has been our socialized behavior Wayne Pawlowski director of counseling at Preterm Inc a womens health clinic in Washington that performs abortions said he encourages women to discuss the abortion with their partners at the clinic but he has not seen a significant demand for special counseling for men In the past when I have gone out in the reception area and asked men if they would be interested in talking there wasnt a whole lot of interest Mr Pawlowski said Counselors agree on the importance of talking about the abortion with the woman and man involved In the course of discussion one partner may discover for example that the other does not want the abortion or that one is blaming the other for the guilt or fear that can arise It is a pretty intense time in their relationship Mr Cummings said and there can be more serious communication about themselves in their relationship and their future and their sexuality than ever before
BRIEFING;   Dept. of Junk Mail,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/13/us/briefing-dept-of-junk-mail.html,The directmail industry routinely puts a provocative sentence or phrase on each of the thousands of envelopes it sends out containing appeals for funds This teaser has the sole purpose of inducing the receiver to open the envelope rather than pitching it immediately into the wastebasket A Washington lawyer recently received an envelope with the message A baby is about to die emblazoned on it He assumed reasonably enough that his name had landed on an antiabortion mailing list But the appeal turned out to be from Greenpeace a wildlife organization and the babies involved are seals
A RIGHTS REVIEW POINTS TO GAINS IN LATIN REGION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/14/world/a-rights-review-points-to-gains-in-latin-region.html,The State Department in an annual review has found continuing deprivation and abuses of human rights in most countries around the world But a senior department official asserted that the most important trend consisted of improvements in Latin America Elliott Abrams Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs said at a news conference today Worldwide I think I would say that the only significant overall trend is the trend toward improvement in the Western Hemisphere In the last five years I think we are now up to nine countries that have gone from military dictatorship to democracy he said Zero countries have gone from democracy to dictatorship Ninth Annual Study This was the ninth annual volume of human rights findings since such a report was first mandated by Congress in 1976 It has grown over the years from an examination of human rights practices only in countries that received American foreign aid to a worldwide study of the status of human rights in 164 countries Its 1453 pages cover not only foreign aid recipients but also Communist governments and other friendly and unfriendly countries that do not get foreign aid The reports that were likely to receive the most attention dealt with the situation in El Salvador where the Administration continues to seek major increases in foreign aid and Nicaragua which it is trying to undermine by securing aid for the antiGovernment rebels It said that while human rights abuses remain a central issue in El Salvador there has been substantial progress in the last year Substantial Drop Cited It said political killings are now substantially lower than in the past The report said the rate per month had dropped from 800 in 1980 to 46 in the last half of 1984 In contrast to the situation in the past there is no credible evidence to suggest that violence against civilians is now even tacit Government policy As far as can be determined the majority of alleged civilian deaths stemming from military operations were actually guerrilla combatants it said However some rights group were quick to criticize some sections of the report particularly those dealing with El Salvador On Nicaragua the report said that the Government continued to tighten Sandinista control over Nicaraguan society and to intimidate the remaining opposition It quoted from the Permanent Human Rights Commission an independent group as finding that the Managua Government was responsible for the deaths of a number of detained persons in 1984  it cited six cases  and had carried out systematic physical and psychological abuse and torture The report said the Roman Catholic Church once supportive of the Sandinistas was now increasingly disenchanted The report found that in Guatemala a country whose human rights abuses were sharply criticized in past studies significant steps were taken last year to return the country to democratic rule It said that overall human rights conditions improved The State Department found that the human rights situation in some key countries such as Chile and Peru was aggravated by terrorist activities Pinochets State of Siege In Chile under the army general President Augusto Pinochet the report said the Government imposed a state of siege to curb growing terrorism and to control delinquency and violent protesters However the same authority was used against nonviolent political dissenters as well it said The state of siege it said had resulted in numerous violations of internationallyrecognized human rights and a general deterioration of human rights practices In Peru the report said the rise of terrorist activity has had a seriously disruptive effect on the political life of the country An upsurge of terrorist violence in mid1984 appeared to provoke a corresponding campaign of security force counterviolence it said The fact of a rising death toll and widespread brutality was indisputable it said The report noted that the Peruvian Government had disputed charges of purported abuses made by international and local human rights spokesmen and was often uncooperative in dealing with them Peruvian officials have regularly asserted that they were in compliance with accepted standards of human rights Chile a Big Disappointment Mr Abrams said Chile was the greatest disappointment because a movement toward a return to democracy has been stalled and the degree of political repression has grown during the year The Soviet Union and all of its Warsaw Pact allies were found to have committed many violations of human rights Soviet performance in the realm of human rights fails to meet accepted international standards the report said The regimes common response to efforts to exercise freedom of expression is to incarcerate those concerned in prison labor camp or psychiatric hospital Mr Abrams said there was a new crackdown last year in the Soviet Union on Jews and Protestants In Iran the report said there has been improvement in the past two years although serious abuses are continuing It singled out Irans persecution of the Bahai religion The report said that at least 29 Bahais in custody were killed in 1984 and that 750 or more remained in prison Although many abuses continue conditions have improved over the immediate postrevolutionary period it said The report said that Iranian authorities allowed besides Moslems Jews Christians and Zoroastrians to practice their religions But since the Bahai religion is not recognized Bahais have suffered severe persecution since the revolution mainly Governmentdirected and aimed at the religious leadership Some Concern Over China In China the report noted that although it was contrary to official Chinese policy there have been numerous reports of coercive birth control practices including forced abortions and sterilizations Another apparent result of the Governments effort to curb population growth has been a revival of the traditional practice of female infanticide it said although senior Chinese officials condemn it and say it is not widespread In the Philippines an American ally facing insurgencies and political opposition the report said there continued to be serious human rights violations in 1984 particularly in areas affected by the Communist insurgency It said there were many wellfounded reports of harassment of civilians arbitrary arrests detentions and disappearances instances of torture unlawful searches and seizures and summary executions or salvagings of suspected insurgents and insurgent sympathizers Although the Government has ordered investigations and urged respect for civilians few within the military are seriously punished for abusive actions the report said Question on South Korea The report said that in South Korea despite guarantees of freedom and human rights they were abridged in practice It noted that the maintenance of tight security in that country had brought charges that dissent and peaceful opposition political activity are suppressed and to many Koreans the degree of legitimacy of the Government of President Chun Doo Hwan is open to question It said that politicians and newspapers who publicly criticize the Government are aware that there are limits beyond which they may be subject to some form of government action Uganda was cited as a country where grave human rights violations occurred last year including large numbers of extralegal killings and detentions on the one hand by insurgents and on the other by military The trend back toward the return of law that had been evident in 1983 underwent very serious setbacks in 1984 it said Human rights groups were quick to find fault with some aspects of the report A statement issued by Americas Watch the Helsinki Watch and the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights said that of the individual country reports it reviewed in this years volume most provided credible and comprehensive coverage of human rights conditions around the world But the statement said the report on El Salvador was so thoroughly flawed that it tends to discredit the entire document In marked contrast to other country reports including many describing countries friendly to the United States the report on El Salvador goes to extraordinary lengths to minimize continued gross violations of human rights by that Government It said the State Department had minimized human rights abuses in El Salvador and that this had done a disservice to the cause of human rights because American influence was thereby squandered It is evident that political considerations also entered into the writing of the reports on Guatemala and Nicaragua with abuses played down in the former case and exaggerated in the latter With respect to El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua the country reports have more the characteristics of propaganda for the Reagan Administration policies than the qualities of evenhanded human rights reporting it said
EXCERPTS FROM GOVERNOR'S SPEECH ON POLITICS AND PRINCIPLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/16/nyregion/excerpts-from-governor-s-speech-on-politics-and-principles.html,Following are excerpts from the text of Governor Cuomos Chubb Fellowship lecture at Yale University Galileo as you know described the world as he saw it a world that circled the sun in constant orbit Many people had trouble accepting this They were taught the earth was the center of the universe and never moved It challenged their perception of the universe and they believed challenged the basis of their faith So with the help of the Inquisition they forced Galileo to kneel before their tribunal and retract his assertion that the earth moved They made him say the earth was stationary because God had created it that way Galileo knelt and spoke the words they forced him to speak he denied the earth orbited the sun But as he arose those around him heard him say in a quiet voice E pur si muove But still it moves Tenets of Philosophy Despite the events of last November I havent changed the underlying tenets of my political philosophy E pur si muove Why should I As Governor of New York Ill continue to seek new ways to improve our state but why should I seek new principles The major intervening event since the Democratic Convention was the overwhelming victory of President Reagan Not the overwhelming victory of the Republican philosophy in the Senate or in the House of Representatives but the overwhelming victory of President Reagan It seems to me there comes a point where the eagerness to change can become an intent to pander    an intent not to lead but simply to win The unfortunate fact for those of us who prefer winning is that what is right is sometimes not popular or at least not likely to get you elected that sometimes the price of saying what you believe is to be rejected Explaining Your Principles The problem is that sticking by your principles requires that you explain your principles and in this age of electronic advocacy this process can often be tedious and frustrating This is especially so when you must get your message across in 28second celluloid morsels when images prove often more convincing than ideas Labels are no longer a tendency in our politics In this electronic age they are our politics Instead of LincolnDouglas debates that last for three hours the most subtle and complex truths are contested in a clash of 28second technicolor movies Consider for a moment what this means Consider trying to describe your position on star wars or the deficit or tax reform or import quotas or the death penalty or abortion in 50 words or less in the space of less than half a minute of television time    even with music Settling for Caricatures But its done all the time with the result that we pigeonhole by stereotypes we settle for caricatures instead of candidates Some are soft on crime others hard on it Some are realistic others bleedinghearts Some are prodefense others antidefense And the ultimate labeling  the final avoidance of analysis and subtlety  is when we simply settle for a oneword summary of an entire philosophy We call candidates conservatives or liberals and when we do we believe weve described everything they hold about the environment human rights foreign policy defense spending the countrys past present and future None of the Above With a lineup of Republicans Democrats conservatives liberals libertarians and populists Id run on the bottom of the ballot under the designation none of the above I guarantee Id win In truth Ive faced this labelling process more than once In running for Governor I was Mario Cuomo the representative as one local paper put it of the old liberalism People expected the programs and policies I spoke about to conform to their image of liberalism and when they didnt  when I said things about crime that didnt sound liberal enough or when I talked about the pain wed have to face in balancing the state budget  some of my supporters got upset They warned me that I was blurring my image turning off that little light that should go on in the voters heads whenever they heard my name So I began prefacing my speeches with the explanation that what I was going to say might not be entirely what people expected to hear The problem I said was wed all become so accustomed to images that maybe what we needed was a whole new political party with a entirely new approach  a platform with only one promise reasonableness Progressive Pragmatism I said lets call the new party the Common Sense Party take a profile of Thomas Paine as its symbol And when people insisted on a slogan  on one phrase to flash on the TV screen under Paines profile  they could have Progressive Pragmatism What would Progressive Pragmatism mean That would depend on the question If the liberals asked what Progressive Pragmatism said about the role of government in our society wed answer It says we should have all the government we need If the conservatives asked wed answer It says we should have only the government we need To the Yuppies independents and the supporters of none of the above wed say  we believe in only the government we need but we insist on all the government we need The object of this exercise wouldnt be to deny our principles or to confuse people about where we stood but to make them think about a basic political truth That truth is we campaign in poetry But when were elected were forced to govern in prose Speeches and Statutes And when we govern  as distinguished from when we campaign  we come to understand the difference between a speech and a statute Its here that the noble aspirations neat promises and slogans of a campaign get bent out of recognition or even break as you try to nail them down to the Procrustean bed of reality Consider for example the difference between President Reagans recent State of the Union Address and his proposed budget The State of the Union was a magnificent piece of political theater eloquent and uplifting On the other hand the budget is drab harsh even draconian The State of the Union indicated that although the budget was a problem its one well grow our way out of But the budget slashes away at the middle class in an effort to reduce a deficit in danger of spinning out of control The State of the Union talks about restoring traditional family values But the budget subverts the economic stability of millions of poor and middleclass families denying them the aid for housing education food and mass transit they depend on Simplistics and Complexities Is there a way to avoid these contradictions Is there a way to bridge the yawning credibility gap between what we promise and how we perform Between the simplistics of campaigning and the complexities of governing I think there is I think you begin by being clear about what you believe both during the campaign and after it stating as directly and concisely  over and over again  the principles that shape your politics that are its soul What are those principles  as we see them in New York We start with Lincolns simple definition of government as the means by which the people do what needs to be done but which they cannot by individual effort do at all or do so well by themselves We are agreed that the maintenance of our systems of public education public health public schools public transit public safety  our courts and schools and roads and police  are all the proper responsibility of government Producers of Wealth We know that what gives government the resources to do these things is the freeenterprise system We believe therefore that government must accommodate the producers of wealth indeed that it must encourage as many people as possible to pursue the honest rewards of imagination ambition and hard work But we recognize that even at its best the freeenterprise system wont be able to include everyone that therell always be those left out the frail the poor the old Those without skills or hope sometimes without even a roof over their heads We are confident that government can act progressively and pragmatically to help care for those who simply cant care for themselves And as well as recognizing the obligations of government we admit its limits We are not confident about governments ability to configure our souls and consciences We dont want government telling us what our relationship with our god should be We sum up our view of ourselves as a community  as a government  with one word family A Simple Reaffirmation This intelligent selfinterest this synergism isnt an excuse for fiscal waste in governemnt It isnt a commitment to any one program or social policy A specific pledge to retain old ideas or even endorse new ones It isnt a call to blind compassion Its a simple reaffirmation of what we are as a people What we are capable of when we learn to draw on all of our strengths to deal with all of our vulnerabilities In New York neither Republicans nor Democrats apologize for government we use it intelligently reasonably proudly I subscribe to these principles because Ive seen them work Ive seen them work both as Governor and as the child of immigrants People who couldnt speak the language people whose one great hope was a better life for their children A government capable of compassion and common sense helped lift their children to the middle class and higher It did that for me And it helped make life better for millions of others In cities and the rural south On farms and in factories With landgrant colleges the GI bill the TVA the civil rights act The occupational safety act unemployment insurance the minimum wage FHA loans Medicare Medicaid Social Security Head Start student loans the national highway act the voting rights act fair housing Principles of Hope So even if all the polls and all the pundits said it was prudent to forget  that to deny these principles was the price of popularity  I would prefer to remember Not out of arrogance but because I would prefer to believe in the hope my principles represented Than to live with a future of shrunken aspirations I dont want to accept as destiny what we once believed it was in our power to change I dont accept that the price of progress for the majority of us is that government must forget the rest of us I dont believe that to have part of the nation become a shining city on a hill we must condemn the rest of the nation to deteriorating ghettoes with more homeless more hungry more poor than at any time since the Great Depression Policies of Heart and Head I will not accept the proposition that we cannot afford to fight crime in the streets of our cities or alleviate the needs of our elderly or help the children of our struggling middle class to educate themselves because all of our national wealth must go for the endless accumulation of missiles The preservation of our large corporations from taxation and for interest on the debt we amass in that profligacy I reject the proposition what we must choose between policies of the heart and policies of the head I know what the results of the last election were I know what 59 percent of the electorate appeared to believe for that moment Surely thats significant And I understand how this defeat has created the temptation to be silent to accept the victors version of the truth But I hope I will be strong enough to know all of this and still be able to say E pur si muove
"CUOMO, AT YALE, URGES DEMOCRATS TO REMAIN WITH TESTED PRINCIPLES",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/16/nyregion/cuomo-at-yale-urges-democrats-to-remain-with-tested-principles.html,Governor Cuomo called on the Democratic Party today to reaffirm the principles that he said had governed the United States for nearly five decades Theyve proven their worth in practice he said From 1932 to 1980 they worked for a whole nation In a speech that he brought to Yale University as a Chubb Fellow the Governor said that despite the defeat President Reagan administered to the Democrats last year the party should return to the principles that prevailed until Mr Reagan became President Those principles he said require government to encourage as many people as possible to pursue the honest rewards of imagination ambition and hard work while helping to care for those who simply cant care for themselves Governor Cuomo said his own administration in Albany exemplified those principles He said they had enabled him to begin the largest reconstruction program in our history giving jobs to thousands of people and to do more for the disabled and unemployed than ever before Weve done it not with deficits and fiscal gimmicks he continued but with balanced budgets Indeed this year well even cut taxes The principles I believe in are working he said so I dont see any reason for abandoning them simply because the Republican candidate won a Presidential election Mr Cuomo said sticking by your principles requires explaining them and as he has often done he charged that President Reagan disguised his beliefs with rhetoric Offering Mr Reagan as an example of candidates whose contents dont match the packaging he said that the President is considered a conservative but that he did not act like a conservative in giving the nation the biggest government in our history And the Governor continued he wants to give government the authority to dictate a womans choice on abortion and how and where children should pray Mr Cuomo flew to New Haven for an overnight visit at Yale that began at dinner with students and was followed by his speech and a questionandanswer session The Chubb Fellowship was established 49 years ago to encourage students to pursue careers in public service previous fellows have included Presidents Truman Ford Carter and Reagan Governor Cuomo had joked that he expected to simply chat with a few young people smoking pipes But he had crafted the speech with care aware that whatever his own protestations it would be looked upon by some as another in a series of speeches that he began with his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention last summer Many politicians see these statements as a foundation for a possible Presidential campaign by Mr Cuomo a plan that he dismisses every time it is propounded A Philosophy to Embrace In his speech here Mr Cuomo denied that he was a de facto or de jure spokesperson for my party Still he laid out a philosophy that he said the Democratic Party should embrace He called the speech E Pur Si Muove  but nevertheless it moves  the words that Galileo according to legend muttered after his inquisitors forced him to retract his assertion that the Earth moved He derided the agitation among some Democrats to establish a new image for the party Should we admit the foundations of our political beliefs are so many reeds to be shaken by the winds of political popularity  or even an electrical hurricane It seems to me there comes a point where the eagerness to change can become an intent to pander    an intent not to lead but simply to win LincolnDouglas Debates In defining what the party should stand for he called for a resistance to labels which he said are no longer a tendency in our politics but are our politics Comparing politics in the electronic age with the LincolnDouglas debates he said the debates lasted for three hours while today the most subtle and complex truths are contested in a clash of 28 second Technicolor movies But slogans do not fit with government reality he said The truth is we campaign in poetry but when were elected were forced to govern in prose And when we govern  as distinguished from when we campaign  we come to understand the difference between a speech and a statute In defining what government should do he said the place to start was with Lincolns definition that government should do what needs to be done that people cannot do by themselves No Apology for Government His own view could be summed up Mr Cuomo said by his familiar image of the community as a family In New York he said neither Republicans nor Democrats apologize for government We use it intelligently reasonably proudly I reject the proposition that we must choose between policies of the heart and policies of the head
TV NOTES;   'NIGHTLINE' TO BROADCAST FROM SOUTH AFRICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/16/arts/tv-notes-nightline-to-broadcast-from-south-africa.html,Nightline the latenight discussion and analysis program anchored by Ted Koppel on ABC will televise five nights of programming from South Africa during the week of March 18 The telecasts will be transmitted by satellite marking the first time Nightline has ventured overseas A lot of people have been to the Soviet Union said Rick Kaplan executive producer of the program but we chose South Africa because we felt it was underreported and just beginning to gain news momentum The program is scheduled to originate live from various locations in South Africa and will include taped reports by Mr Koppel as well as Jeff Greenfield and Ken Walker from areas beyond the population centers that are the usual subjects of the news media said Mr Kaplan We want to show people as much as we can of the country so they can understand many of the political social and economic problems Each night will be devoted to a different topic and guests to be interviewed by Mr Koppel said Mr Kaplan will represent every position that can be articulated from within the country The South African Government granted permission to Nightline yesterday after considering ABCs proposal for nearly three months according to Mr Kaplan We made no deals going in he said We know of no restrictions and we have agreed to none Film Shows an AbortionA controversial film showing the abortion of a fetus can be seen tomorrow night on the Rev Jerry Falwells new cabletelevision program Jerry Falwell Live The 28minute film The Silent Scream has been praised by President Reagan and this week was distributed to members of Congress by the National Right to Life Committee So far however television viewers have seen only small glimpses of the film on news programs Mr Falwells program which began last month appears from 1105 PM to midnight each Sunday evening on WTBSTV the Atlanta television station owned by Ted Turner and distributed to 34 million cable subscribers by satellite This will be the first time the film will be shown on network television in its entirety said Cal Thomas vice president for communications of Moral Majority which is headed by Mr Falwell The liberals have had a lock on the medium for 12 years and now the empire is striking back The film as described by Dr Bernard Nathanson an obstetrician who says he switched from performing abortions to crusading against them shows pictures created by ultrasonic waves directed at a 12weekold fetus being aborted In the film the image of the fetus appears to recoil during the abortion procedure and at one point Dr Nathansan indicates that the mouth of the fetus opens in what he characterizes as a silent scream of pain According to expert medical opinion however that interpretation is inaccurate as well as dishonest To make a statement that the fetus feels pain is a totally ridiculous statement said Dr Edwin C Myer chairman of the department of pediatric neurology at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond Pain implies cognition There is no brain to receive the information Mr Thomas said that after the film is shown on Jerry Falwell Live Dr Nathanson will address criticism of his narration Mr Falwell will also announce a fundraising campaign to duplicate the film and send it to 50000 churches around the country If there is time Mr Falwell will have his customary callin segment in which viewers are invited to call in and ask him questions A Live Situation ComedyFor the first time in three decades a situation comedy will be presented live in prime time next Saturday night Well be working without a net said Hal Cooper coexecutive producer and director of Gimme a Break the NBC comedy which stars Nell Carter as a housekeeper for a gruff police officer A situation comedy is about the toughest thing to do live said Mr Cooper who has not directed comedy live on television since the mid1950s Unlike variety where you can do another chorus or drop a small sketch if you come up short you have a script with a beginning middle and end and you have the unpredictability of the audience If they laugh more than you expect you run out of time if they laugh less they leave you short To prepare his cast most of whom have worked on the stage Miss Carter received a Tony Award for her role in Aint Misbehavin  Mr Cooper will rehearse more intensively To signal the special character of the program we will open with shots of the audience and have the announcer yell Live from Hollywood  said Mr Cooper At the end of the show we will have curtain calls But during the show if we do it right you wont be able to notice any difference The idea for the live telecast came from Brandon Tartikoff president of NBC Entertainment There are ingredients that make it attractive said Mr Tartikoff There is a different energy from actors who know they have to do it right the first time rather than knowing they can pick it up later Also you can be more of the moment you can be topical in little ways by referring to a movie that has just come out or something in the newspaper If the program works Mr Tartikoff said he may put a live topical situation comedy into the prime time schedule possible as early as next year Lorne Michaels formerly producer of Saturday Night Live is currently planning one such program Mr Tartikoff said there were considerations other than program experimentation A live broadcast of a situation comedy such as Gimme a Break that gets average ratings is one way to draw in new viewers particularly during the February sweeps when the ratings services tally local audiences so stations can set their advertising rates Am I above trying something like that in the February sweeps asked Mr Tartikoff No I am not above that

EVANGELICAL POP A HIT OF THE RECORD BUSINESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/20/arts/evangelical-pop-a-hit-of-the-record-business.html,Contemporary pop music with evangelical Christian lyrics is one of the fastestgrowing segments of the American recording industry Statistics are hard to find since most of the record companies that produce the music are privately owned and do not disclose their finances but in the last five years Christian music has grown from 3 percent to roughly 5 to 7 percent of the American retail record market  about equal with classical music and higher than jazz according to the Recording Industry Association of America As it has developed contemporary Christian music has encompassed all the major categories of secular pop including hard rock heavy metal jazzfusion popsoul and country Stylistically the music of 24yearold Amy Grant  the genres first superstar  is a hybrid of Nashville and Los Angeles studio pop styles Her songs and arrangements reflect the influence of Olivia NewtonJohn the Eagles the Doobie Brothers and other highgloss popmusic studio acts from the 70s and early 80s Synthesizers and Guitars Their sophisticated syncopated arrangements blend synthesizers electric pianos guitars and edgy popfunk rhythms into a contemporary sound that except for its lyrics is indistinguishable from Top 40 radio fare Where contemporary Christian music departs from secular pop is in its lyrics Most of the songs have addressed salvation and praise of Jesus Christ said Stan Moser executive vice president of Word Records the most prominent Christianmusic label But as we reach a broader spectrum of the Christian community things are beginning to change Some of the subjects addressed in recent songs have been premarital sex abortion and even computers Though Christian pop lyrics vary in how aggressively they deliver the message the most popular songs tend to be vaguely romantic Straight ahead I can see Your light Straight ahead through the dark Straight ahead theres no left or right Straight ahead to your heart goes the title song of Amy Grants most recent album Two Different Genres The music trade currently distinguishes two different genres of commercial Christian music One category is called Spiritual  traditional Southern black church music which has a small stable audience The other is Inspirational  a multiethnic contemporary studio pop which is the genre leading the boom Last month AM Records the countrys largest privately owned record company and Word which commands 40 percent of the Christian music market signed an agreement by which AM will manufacture distribute and promote Word and its nine associated labels The albums of Miss Grant and the rock group Petra  two of the most popular Word acts  will be released on AM Weve guaranteed Word that we can achieve a significant increase in sales in the secular market over a threeyear period by using our promotion staff to get their records Top 40 airplay Gil Friesen AMs president said recently With the proper radio exposure I think that Amy Grant has the potential to sell as many records as Carole King Publishes Christian Books Word which was founded in 1951 and is based in Waco Tex is also a major publisher of Christian books including the literature of Billy Graham It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC Publishing Since the early 1970s Words musical operations have grown at an annual rate of 20 to 25 percent Word doesnt disclose its finances but recordindustry sources estimate its musical revenues have risen to around 30 million a year and Amy Grant recently became the first Gospel artist to have an album certified gold more than 500000 copies by the Recording Industry Association of America Words major competitors are the Benson Company in Nashville and Sparrow and Light Records both based in Southern California AM is not the first major label to become involved with contemporary Christian music MCA Records distributed the Christian label Songbird for four years starting in 1979 Elektra Records briefly distributed Light and CBS distributed Priority All three relationships have ended But according to Stan Moser Words executive vice president these failures were to due to poor timing Competitive Only Recently Until recently the quality of contemporary Christian pop wasnt very high he said Its only in the last few years that it has become competitive with secular pop Recording budgets have risen in the last five years from 20000 to 100000 with most of our records cut in Los Angeles or Nashville Some of our most popular artists like Leon Patillo who was in the rock group Santana and Philip Bailey of Earth Wind and Fire have been very successful secularmusic performers The boom in evangelical pop is an outgrowth of the Christian revival of the late 1960s The spread of the music while impressive has been impeded by the lack of a sophisticated distribution and promotional network Even after the revival began Gospel radio stations continued to focus on preaching and traditional hymns West Coast the Main Market The main outlet for the records became a network of several thousand Christian bookstores But contemporary Christian radio stations also eventually sprang up in the early 70s and today there are two dozen 24hour stations across the country The main market for contemporary Christian music is the West Coast followed by the Southwest particularly Texas and Oklahoma But as has been shown by Amy Grant who sold out Radio City Music Hall last year there is an audience in the Northeast as well Our statistics show that about 50 percent of the United States population are active churchgoers Mr Moser said but only 10 percent of them frequent Christian bookstores and shops That means weve been reaching perhaps 10 to 20 million people Working with AM we hope to speak to that other 80 or 90 million who listen to Top 40 radio and who have said yes to Christianity
LETTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/21/garden/l-letter-042438.html,Barbara Ehrenreichs Hers column of Feb 7 drew widespread reaction A sample of representative letters to The New York Times follows TO THE HOME SECTION Thank you for Barbara Ehrenreichs demystification of the abortion issue an act of considerable courage I also had two abortions many years ago One took all my savings 600 in 1941 was a fortune The other thanks to a humanitarian doctor in New Jersey who charged 40 took a crackofdawn long bus ride from Manhattan Weeks later in my gratitude I took that ride again to give him more money  not that I had it to spare but because I was amazed at his generosity and humaneness He wouldnt take it not even for his nurse Both of these were done for different reasons under different circumstances but in both cases it was impossible to imagine my life postpartum with a new life on my hands I was willing to die instead In between I had two sons who grew up to be scientists so it wasnt that I wouldnt have children under any circumstances Wouldnt the righttolifers who I believe basically represent just a lastditch effort to push women back into purdah prove their love of life best by undertaking to raise all those lives theyre out to save SOPHIE WILKINS Manhattan TO THE HOME SECTION I read with great interest Barbara Ehrenreichs column concerning the abortion issue I have examined a great many arguments both pro and con and seldom have found one so based on egoism If one were to distill Mrs Ehrenreichs argument one would be left with I should have an abortion because I want one Such selfcentered philosophy especially when it is surrounded by flippant treatment of the major issues in the debate is appalling JAMES B SIMONS Ambridge Pa TO THE HOME SECTION Thank you for Barbara Ehrenreichs Hers column at last we have someone with the courage to bring reason to a subject that shouldnt be in the public realm at all I only wish that attention had been devoted to the orphans of women whod died of botched abortions before they were legal  responsible women who would only bring into the world children for whom they could care Abortions have been a fact of life since the dawn of history and only occasionally and for brief periods in isolated places have they been illegal Were abortion to be outlawed again in the United States women of means would go abroad for safe legal operations Women lacking sufficient funds would continue to have abortions as well  back alley ones sometimes paying with their lives BEATRICE WILLIAMS Manhattan TO THE HOME SECTION A propos of Barbara Ehrenreichs article a womans choice to be pregnant should be made in the bedroom not in the abortion clinic Responsible sex would see to it that this is the case CLARENCE AVEY Westfield Mass TO THE HOME SECTION Barbara Ehrenreich says what must be said The living breathing feeling taxpaying and voting vessels of fetuses are people Women have always been the other to mens norm  it seems now that the antiabortion movement would send us to the realm of the nonexistent ELAINE SILVER Manhattan TO THE HOME SECTION Barbara Ehrenreich is presenting just one more way of saying that the comfort safety and welfare of the mother outweigh the babys right to live Certainly safer forms of birth control carry a higher risk of pregancy and the trauma of carrying bearing and possibly giving away an unwanted child would be extreme But the question is not as Miss Ehrenreich contends what is more comfortable for the mother but what is right Right and wrong are not fashionable words nowadays but theyre good words and they mean something too SHIRLEY TUNG Manhattan TO THE HOME SECTION It is about time that someone as intelligent and wellspoken as Barbara Ehrenreich wrote about abortion I had an abortion also it was many years ago I did not regret the decision at the time  nor have I regretted it since But the antiabortion movement was starting to give me feelings of guilt Im so very grateful that she put into words something that has needed to be said for a very long time D M PEARSON Wayne Pa TO THE HOME SECTION To contend that abortion is a viable backup to a failed birth control device and should not come under the umbrella of a moral dilemma is abhorrent and irresponsible An abortion for therapeutic reasons is worthy of consideration However there seems to be no moral justification in expunging an unwanted pregnancy for fear it will become an inconvenience or interference in a womans life I wonder where we ever got the idea that life has to be fair LYNN RICKARD Edison NJ TO THE HOME SECTION The President has started his second term saying that a woman must go through nine months of pregnancy with all the sacrifices it entails because there are lots of people out there who are looking for babies to adopt So what is woman Simply a babymaking machine As Miss Ehrenreich says abortions will continue as they have for centuries  all that will happen is that if denied the right of choice women will not be protected by professional and legal operations My husband and I are well along in years and we say Miss Ehrenreich is 100 percent right ANN STONE New Canaan Conn TO THE HOME SECTION As a committed adherent of choice on the abortion issue I was appalled by Barbara Ehrenreichs lack of sensitivity for women who have gone through emotional crisis by her utter superficiality in failing to grasp the philosophical concept that choice implies conflicting interests and finally by her trivializing use of such words as stylish and fashionable in addressing the question Her column is a fearful example of with friends like that who needs enemies and has done great disservice to the prochoice cause MARGOT SOHMER Jackson Heights Queens TO THE HOME SECTION As one who remembers the 5 AM meeting with a strange doctor the ride to an unknown destination on Long Island and a lonely ride back I believe Barbara Ehrenreichs was the most outspoken and honest piece I have yet seen on the abortion issue I hope the article will stir more people to loudly protest the contemplated uncivilized change to make abortion illegal Though I no longer have to worry I certainly sympathize with younger generations and sincerely thank Miss Ehrenreich for championing the cause so eloquently AILEEN B CRAMER Woodstock NY TO THE HOME SECTION Barabra Ehrenreich doth protest too much The nerve of people even in liberal circles these days discussing abortion in terms of a moral dilemma Unfortunately or fortunately moral agonizing is part of what distinguishes the human race from other species And abortion a moral question centuries old was not just deemed so yesterday by the Moral Majority I resent Miss Ehrenreich equating full personhood with what she thinks a man might do in the same circumstances that is label the pregnancy a disease and terminate it out of fear immediately I know many males who would resent this charge as well MARY CHILD Washington TO THE HOME SECTION Barbara Ehrenreich is right on track with the subject of abortion It is strictly a problem that the female must cope with In many countries an allowance is awarded to mothers and babies until a certain age This is for all classes and not just for those on welfare In the United States there is no such thing And the social welfare authorities do nothing to prevent pregnancy especially in the young JOANNE HERSH Peekskill NY
CONTRACEPTION BILL ADVANCES IN IRISH PARLIAMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/21/world/contraception-bill-advances-in-irish-parliament.html,Irelands coalition Government narrowly won initial approval in Parliament tonight for a measure to allow the sale without a prescription of contraceptives to anyone 18 years or older The legislation an amendment to the current law was bitterly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church Contraceptives can now be sold legally only for bona fide family planning purposes which has been interpreted to mean married couples only and only with a medical prescription The amendment approved today liberalizes the rules for condoms and spermicides It also eases restrictions on the distribution of the contraceptives by making them available at doctors offices hospitals and family planning clinics Current law restricts availability to registered pharmacists Before the legislation becomes law it must go through a final committee review Thursday and debate in the largely powerless Senate The process should be completed by the middle of next month The Government indicated that it was confident it had the backing to prevent any alterations The vote was 83 to 80 with two abstentions Five members defected from the governing Fine GaelLabor Party coalition despite the announcement that voting was to be on strict party lines As a result they face expulsion from their parties and the Government could find its majority reduced to a razorthin margin on close votes in the future Political commentators here described the vote as the first defeat ever sustained by the Catholic Church in a headon confrontation with an Irish Government on social legislation Leading politicians attempted to play down the churchGovernment conflict However several said that defeat of the legislation would have been a severe blow to hopes for eventual reunification of Protestantdominated Northern Ireland with the Republic This is a watershed in terms of where real legislative power is exercised said Desmond OMalley an independent member in the Dail the principal house of Parliament The contraceptive aspect of this got lost in the broader issues Leading Catholic bishops parish priests and the opposition Fianna Fail Party opposed the legislation on several grounds Some argued that there was no demand or need for it Others said it would send Ireland down a slippery slope of moral degradation by condoning licentious sexual behavior Although church leaders have said they do not want Ireland to be a theocracy some preached that Catholic legislators should as practicing Catholics oppose the legislation in line with the churchs position that all forms of contraception violate Catholic doctrine Supporters argued that there was no evidence in Northern Ireland or elsewhere that availability of contraceptives had the dire results pictured by opponents The cataclysmic predictions of the consequences are incredible said Desmond Barry the Minister of Health Mr Barry said that the legislation would reduce the incidence of venereal disease and abortion and that the opposition showed how far we have to go before we have the true emancipation of women in this country Some supporters noting that contraceptives were freely if illegally available to the wealthy and in Dublin described the issue as one of fair treatment for the whole of society and individual freedom There are a lot of women in this country who are using medical contraception  such as the pill  because nonmedical contraception that would be better is not available Noreen Byrne head of a leading Dublin clinic for women said The church is forgetting what is happening in reality The real issue is who rules the country A dispatch from Dublin yesterday on legislation regulating the sale of contraceptives misidentified Irelands Minister of Health and Social Welfare He is Barry Desmond
THEATER: A FRESH LOOK FOR O'NEILL'S 'INTERLUDE',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/arts/theater-a-fresh-look-for-o-neill-s-interlude.html,WHEN Eugene ONeills Strange Interlude opened on Broadway in 1928 it was widely hailed as a revolutionary experiment  a thunderous psychodrama that ushered Joycean modernism and Freudian theory into the American theater The play won its author his third Pulitzer Prize had a smash run and spawned two road companies But 35 years later  as seen in the Actors Studio revival of 1963  Strange Interlude had been eclipsed by the ONeill masterworks that followed it Not only did many cease to find this work profound or powerful Strange Interlude looked so dated that some relegated it to the oblivion of kitsch Now two decades have passed and a further reappraisal could be at hand Whatever else this fivehour play has been called by its adherents and detractors since 1928 no one has ever claimed it was fun Yet thats exactly what Strange Interlude proves to be in the inspired English revival that has arrived at the Nederlander Two awesome actors  Glenda Jackson and Edward Petherbridge  and a courageously impudent director Keith Hack have given this work a fresh and unexpected life While Strange Interlude hardly emerges as the cosmic statement that ONeill intended  and while some of it is indeed pretentious pulp  it often seems the most enjoyable not to mention deranged comedy of sexual anxiety that Noel Coward or Philip Barry never wrote In outline Strange Interlude sounds less like comedy than a dimenovel parody of Strindberg or Ibsen Over nine acts stretching through 25 years ONeill unfolds the saga of Nina Leeds Miss Jackson an angry strongwilled woman determined to love mother and if need be destroy the many men who intersect her orbit The plot is pure  and in its later stages laughable  soap opera As Nina toys with the dashing doctor Edmund Darrell Brian Cox the jovial advertising man Sam Evans James Hazeldine and the asexual novelist Charles Marsden Mr Petherbridge were treated to a manycourse feast of lurid doings nervous breakdowns promiscuity and adultery an abortion cases of congenital insanity and disguised paternity as well as enough sudden deaths to stock a season of Dynasty ONeill hoped that this story would turn the manipulative everchanging Nina into a vessel for all his addled conflicted thoughts about womanhood While that theme dies aborning another survives  and it is the key to Mr Hacks radical reinterpretation In Strange Interlude the characters are constantly trying to create happiness by controlling and ordering life even a baby is eugenically conceived Yet such schemes are always undone by unruly emotions No matter how much Nina meddles and calculates to get what she wants she ultimately finds that our lives are merely strange dark interludes in the electrical display of God the Father Looked at somberly  as ONeill apparently wished  such futile thrashings against destiny could be considered tragic But couldnt they also be seen as absurdly funny Miss Jackson delivers that line with a mad chuckle  just as she has laughed earlier while decrying the God who makes life a lie and a joke What Mr Hack and his cast discover throughout the text is that ONeills language while often too purple to support breastbeating can sustain a sardonic tone with no loss of meaning Far from mocking the script this company  at amazing risk  has unearthed what still seems genuine and vital in it In the process Mr Hack has made a startling virtue of what most would consider the plays dead weight  its socalled thought asides These are the lengthy soliloquies in which the characters pause in midscene to confess their inner feelings directly to the audience Even in the 20s Groucho Marx mocked these streamofconsciousness confessionals in Animal Crackers and certainly they can be rhetoricinfested or redundant But unlike past directors of the play Mr Hack doesnt portentously arrest the action for the asides Colloquially spoken  and often indicated only by a slight shift of a speakers head or vocal key  they become the crux of an evening in which characters hide behind the sounds called words This is particularly true when theyre delivered by Mr Petherbridges Marsden A timid highminded mothers boy who writes popular genteel novels about dear old ladies and devilish bachelors Marsden emerges here as a witty bitchy chorus  a detached Jamesian observer who is always the first to spot everyones hypocrisies including his own With his prissy whine fragile bearing and gloomy shadowy eyes Mr Petherbridge always looks like the old maid hes claimed to be he twists like a weathervane when buffeted by others passions and forever seems to be fastidiously picking at stray lint But whether hes passing judgment on fellow characters or the adolescent materialism of the Jazz Age his asides are undiluted acid  and hilariously expressive of a fatalistic vision that ONeill put to loftier uses elsewhere in his career Mr Petherbridge last seen as Newman Noggs in Nicholas Nickleby is simply priceless in this role by the time he reaches his delicate drunk scene the audience is eating up his every word Though their characters arent as juicy Mr Cox as the dashing doctor who turns rancid and Mr Hazeldine as the innocent dope who evolves into a brash exemplar of 20s Babbitry are also firstrate Their asides contain more spelledout Freudian motivations than slashing observations but the actors still create a comic tension between the characters secret yearnings and public masks between their highest ideals and tawdriest actions So springy are the constant pingponglike shifts between word and deed that the cathartic Act VI closing in which Nina claims psychic dominance over her three men almost plays like Tracy Lords champagnefueled nocturnal rondelay with her trio of suitors in The Philadelphia Story Miss Jackson even sounds a bit like Katharine Hepburn  but with her helmet of hair and gashed features she looks like a cubist portrait of Louise Brooks Her role has breadth not stature Nina is but a conceit designed to represent successively every breed of woman ONeill could imagine from wanton to predatory mother and the motivation for her maniacal behavior the death of her betrothed in World War I is ludicrously thin The actress nonetheless jumps through each hoop with grace and conviction Shes equally mesmerizing as a Zelda Fitzgeraldesque neurotic a rotting and spiteful middleaged matron and finally a spent sphinxlike widow happily embracing extinction When Miss Jacksons young Nina sobs over her inability to mourn her dead father  or when Mr Coxs decrepit middleaged Edmund is rejected by his own son  theres also sorrow to go with the mean ironic laughter Some other affecting passages arrive when the asides meld and spiral into freefloating anxietyridden verbal chamber music with Miss Jackson always serving as the resonant cello By liberating the script from naturalism  Voyteks towering clapboardbox set spookily lighted by Allen Lee Hughes often disregards ONeills scene settings  Mr Hack rethinks nearly every moment he can He hasnt however done the impossible From the hopelessly melodramatic Act III in which a dirty family secret thumps about like a hooked fish to the frail and sometimes inadequately cast supporting roles Strange Interlude still has plenty of cracks Just the same we return eagerly from the two intermissions only in the final stretch does restlessness set in Foolishly overreaching and yet theatrically gripping Strange Interlude cannot be ranked with ONeills major works but can at least be catalogued with if beneath such other oneofakind American cultural artifacts of its age as Intolerance USA and Porgy and Bess Theres something endearingly crackpot about this play  it speaks to us from the centurys boom time when our culture like the author was at once naive and inordinately ambitious While its remotely possible that others might uncover more in Strange Interlude than Mr Hacks troupe has do figure that another century will be here before we

NICARAGUA HAS A POSTWAR BABY BOOM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/world/nicaragua-has-a-postwar-baby-boom.html,From the Sandinista leadership to peasant families this country is experiencing a baby boom Since 1978 Nicaraguas population has jumped from 25 million to about 32 million a 28percent increase In 1985 and for the forseeable future it is expected to grow at a rate of 33 percent a year one of the highest in the world By contrast the United States registered a population increase of nine tenths of 1 percent last year The growth rate for Latin America from 1983 to 1984 was 23 percent A Natural Phenomenon Its a perfectly natural phenomenon said Pedro Cavalcante program director in Nicaragua for the United Nations Development Program Demographic studies have shown that there is always a large population increase after a war or a natural catastrophe and that certainly applies to Nicaragua Precise figures on the dimensions of the Nicaraguan baby boom are hard to get The national census originally scheduled for 1982 has been indefinitely postponed because of fighting in border areas and the Nicaraguan Institute of Statistics and Census works from estimates based on sketchy surveys on health and voting Nevertheless Nicaraguan and foreign demographic specialists here agree that the trend is certain to continue if not increase Projections published by the United Nations Population Division forecast a population of 525 million by the end of the century For Managua the projections are even more dramatic A study recently completed by the statistics institute predicts that the Nicaraguan capital which had about 600000 inhabitants at the time of the Sandinista victory will have 19 million people in the year 2000 Infant Mortality Declines To a large extent the population explosion is a result of the Sandinista Governments success in lowering the infant mortality rate In the last six years that death rate has dropped from 122 to less than 80 per 1000 births according to official figures At the same time because of improvements in other health care programs Nicaraguans are also living longer According to Health Ministry statistics life expectancy has risen since the Sandinista takeover from 53 years to 58 and is projected to reach 65 years by the end of this century In theory Nicaragua should easily be able to accommodate the major population increase that those statistics imply The largest country in Central America it has traditionally had the lowest population density in the region But two consecutive years of no economic growth mean that the standard of living is declining in real terms Resistance to Birth Control Nonetheless family planning is not necessarily seen as the answer We do not believe in indiscriminate birth control said Dr Gina Watson director of maternal and child programs for the Health Ministry You do not end poverty by destroying the poor Nicaraguas problem Dr Watson said is not that there is not enough food but one of distribution Once people are fully integrated into the revolutionary process she added the population boom will tend to be self regulating The Government has made contraceptives available free at state health clinics Sex education programs are being made mandatory for students and family planning information is being widely distributed through block committees and other organizations Our objective is that every couple should have the option to choose the method of family planning and the number of children they want Dr Watson said Families should have full knowledge of birth control methods so they can take responsibility for their own programs Political Constraints Cited Some political analysts and health care specialists here say that political constraints have prevented the Government from pursuing a more aggressive birth control program They argue that with relations between the state and the Roman Catholic Church already tense the Government is reluctant to take steps that would alienate the church further They point out for example that abortion remains restricted to pregnancies in which the mothers life is threatened Birth control programs are also opposed by some elements of the far left who view such efforts as part of an imperialist plot to weaken the third world and keep it docile The two streams of thought come together in the person of Culture Minister Ernesto Cardenal Martinez a poet and Roman Catholic priest Father Cardenal has accused the United States of sending population control experts to Latin America to sterilize peasants against their will In one of his books he said he agreed with a parishioner that family planning advocates kill children before they are born out of fear that later they will be a people they can no longer control Increasing Strains Seen For the moment the Government says it believes it has the population boom well in hand But its planners foresee increasing pressures on hospitals schools transport and other public services that are already overstrained and other experts agree If the population continues to increase and the economy remains in a delicate state I think the problems will tend to aggravate said Mr Cavalcante of the United Nations program The infrastructure that exists now is not sufficient that much we know Already there are some signs that Nicaraguas public services are buckling under the added load According to Government officials Managuas increased population is draining the lake that supplies the city with water a development that has forced the rationing of water in the capital
SENATE OPENS WAY ON AID TO FARMERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/us/senate-opens-way-on-aid-to-farmers.html,A battle weary Senate finally resolved one acrimonious dispute today over farm credit measures but the lawmakers set the stage for another skirmish over the same issue next week The agreement reached today ended a weeklong filibuster against the confirmation of Edwin Meese 3d who was then approved as Attorney General by a vote of 63 to 31 The farm credit compromise approved by the Senate leadership provides that members from both parties can offer proposals for additional aid to hardpressed farmers who are seeking financing to start spring planting The proposals four from each party would be offered as amendments to an African famine relief bill that is scheduled for floor action on Monday Reagan Talk on Farm Issue President Reagan who previously criticized the linking of the credit proposals to the Meese vote said today in his weekly radio broadcast that only a minority of farmers were in severe financial distress and that the taxpayers must not be asked to save every farmer Page 26 The filibuster against the Meese confirmation was carried out by Farm Belt Democrats with the sympathy of some Senate Republicans The bitterly fought compromise also opened the way for approval of legislation releasing more than 7 billion in highway construction money that has been delayed since last year The vote on that bill was 94 to 0 While lawmakers congratulated one other today on reaching the accord many acknowledged that the ferocious clash on the first major issue of the new Congress was a bad way to get started as Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the minority leader put it Senator Gary Hart Democrat of Colorado expressed a common feeling when he said Everyone is saying if this is how it starts how is it going to end Leading Up to Elections To many Senators the week of debate on the farm problems signaled the beginning of an intense campaign for political advantage leading up to the elections of 1986 when control of the narrowly divided Senate will be contested anew The week also provided the first real test of Senator Bob Dole the new majority leader and many Republicans said it was essential for their party to face down the filibustering Democrats and demonstrate their control of the Senate Speaking on the Senate floor today Senator John H Chafee a Rhode Island Republican said of the weeks battle It has nothing to do with the farm crisis It has nothing to do with Mr Meese The point before us is who is going to run the show  Todays agreement ended a frustrating week of false starts and failed talks that set Senate tempers boiling At the peak of animosity Senator Byrd told the Senate early this morning that the Republican message was Let the farmers go to hell A White House Agreement The week began when farm state Senators saw that by holding the Meese nomination hostage they could focus attention on the farm credit issue After several days of talks between lawmakers and Administration officials the White House agreed to expand existing loan programs and make them easier to use Those changes which did not require legislation were put into effect by the Administration on Friday But the filibuster continued because lawmakers could not agree on a formula that would permit Democrats to offer legislative proposals on the farm issue that go beyond the administrative changes by the White House The talks collapsed early this morning over that issue After a few hours sleep for the senators Senator Byrd held a breakfast meeting with his Democratic colleagues and planned strategy to continue their filibuster However Senator Dole and the Republicans came forward with a new offer and an agreement was quickly hammered out by midafternoon Two Programs Involved The administrative changes agreed to by the Administration on Friday would make farm loans available under two existing programs One run by the Farmers Home Administration makes direct Government loans to farmers The other provides Government guarantees for loans made by commercial banks Farmers have been complaining that these loans were caught up in red tape and overly rigid rules Of 650 million in guaranteed loans announced by Mr Reagan in last falls election campaign less than 50 million has been lent so far The new rules will increase the number of loans available while reducing the problems for borrowers and lenders who want to participate Republicans have been arguing that the Administrations quick action on the loan funds demonstrates their partys commitment to the farmers interests The real agricultural issues have been resolved Senator Dole told the Senate in floor debate early this morning The Filibuster Worked But Democrats maintained today that the Administration moved only under pressure from the Democrats The filibuster worked Senator Byrd said Senator J James Exon a Nebraska Democrat added By holding up Ed Meese we have begun to take steps for agriculture The Democrats are anxious to offer amendments next week calling for even more generous loan programs to creditstarved farmers Senator Exon said on the floor today that it was vitally necessary to go beyond the measures agreed to this week and put more cash into farmers pockets by making crop payments available now that are usually available in the fall The Republicans strenuously resisted any agreement that would assure the Democrats a chance to offer amendments Many farm state Republicans are up for reelection next year and they do not want to cast votes that could be used against them in the campaign Theyre paranoid about the 1986 elections and losing the Senate Senator Edward Zorinsky a Nebraska Democrat said of the Republicans This creates a record for the 1986 election as to who truly supports agriculture and who doesnt Farm Belt Senators would be put on the record he added They would have to make a choice between following their party line or voting for their farmers Thats the bottom line Vote on a Resolution This evening the Senate voted 91 to 0 in favor of a resolution spelling out the promised revisions in the loan programs The resolution was meaningless but it gave vulnerable Republicans a chance to cast a vote in favor of farmers The other obstacle stalling an agreement was a division within Republican ranks Several hardline conservatives led by Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Phil Gramm of Texas maintained that if Democrats had the right to offer farmcredit amendments on the African relief bill they wanted the chance to offer their own amendments According to Senator Dole those included proposals banning abortion and legalizing organized prayer in public schools The Republicans saw the farmcredit debate and the filibuster against the Meese nomination as a basic challenge to the right of the majority to run the Senate and set its agenda Senator Slade Gorton a Washington Republican said today that the Democrats tactics were totally inappropriate and totally inconsistent with the traditions of the Senate Once the agreement was reached today the tension broke and Senators talked about bipartisan cooperation on future issues But the scars will linger and many lawmakers agree with the comment of Senator Byrd when he said early this morning Were going to have a long and difficult way to travel as we go through the next two years
Teaching Sex to Schoolchildren,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/opinion/teaching-sex-to-schoolchildren.html,Until a decade ago a parents reluctance to give a child the facts of life was still the stuff of comedy Today theres no humor in that hesitation Parents chief concern then was with the misinformation eagerly provided by precocious classmates Now it extends to the message sent by movies television advertising and the kind of lyric that one used to hear only on socalled party records However elaborately cloaked the message is simple Do it What happens to the adolescents who do is also simple More often than not the girl gets pregnant If she chooses abortion shell be one of the nearly 500000 teenagers who do so every year If she carries the child to term shell probably drop out of high school earn less than half of what women who become mothers in their 20s will earn and become dependent on welfare Chances are her childrens lives wont be any better what with birth weights and IQs that are often lower than for children born to more mature mothers and considering their almost certain problems in school To give children the facts of life requires educating them about sex much earlier than ever before and in a context broad enough to instruct them in choices consequences and responsibilities Anatomy lessons arent enough and never were what is needed are lessons that will help a child live responsibly in a country that has experienced a sexual revolution The right response is evident in New Jersey where the State Board of Educations twoyearold program in family life and sex education comes up for reauthorization on March 6 But it wont be continued if several groups among them the state branches of Right to Life the Moral Majority and the Eagle Forum have their way Sex they insist is only the familys business They assume of course that all parents are willing and eager to discuss sexuality with their children  a patently wrong assumption Putting parents in partnership with the schools however has done a lot to open up the lines of communication Keeping them closed can result only in more outof wedlock babies  and more abortions The most fervent foes of abortion of all people ought to recognize that The New Jersey program has broad support including that of the New Jersey Catholic Conference the National Council of Jewish Women and the New Jersey Conference of PTAs Community groups are rallying parents teachers doctors lawyers and clergy So promising a program deserves extension and emulation
On Language;   ACRONYM SOUGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/magazine/on-language-acronym-sought.html,WHATS IN AN acronym Plenty In areas of great public controversy propagandists seek to get a message into the name of the product or program and when they are successful the sell appears every time the subject comes up We are not talking here of the old Lux Radio Theater which plugged the soap sponsor every time the program appeared in the newspaper listings The newspapers got wise and soon started calling it just Radio Theater I still miss the soothing sound of Cecil B DeMilles saying Good night from Hollywo od A good example of builtin message delivery is right towork laws Who can be against the right to work Organized labor was of course because the laws when passed struck down the union shop labor soon began referring to the legislation as unionbusting laws A more subtle escalation of the technique appeared in the controversy over abortion Antiabortion forces did not want to put themselves in the position of campaigning for a negative and chose pro life proabortion forces did not like to be identified with encouraging abortion which is a harsh word and countered with prochoice That produced a sloganary standoff what are you for life or choice The Reagan Administration was alert in its early days to the need for a fresh start in armscontrol negotiations and was aware that Mr Reagan had campaigned against the second strategic arms limitation talks SALT treaty as fatally flawed which many people still think is a description of improperly installed linoleum They came up with a fresh acronym to replace SALT the strategic arms reduction talks acronamed Start When an acronym exceeds four letters capitalize only the first letter The trick in acronaming by the way is to find a series of initial letters that spell out a pronounceable word MBFR the interminable negotiations in Vienna about Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction which right wingers remember in derision as More Better for Russia is not an acronym MBFR is pronounced as a series of letters not a word and these talks will not be immortalized in a word until someone starts calling them Mubalfor or some such Acronyms applied after the fact of naming an organization or program can ridicule the activity named I was particularly sensitive to this in my political days and closely examined the name of the Committee to Reelect the President in 1972 for possible backfiring CTRTP Comrep Crepres Safe enough I decided and so what later became famous as Creep was born In the same way the Law of the Sea Treaty advocates did not recognize the time bomb ticking in the treatys name when the selected initials came out LOST the opponents who considered it all to be a powergrab by the third world had a handy weapon The ratification of the treaty by the United States was sunk in what Washington wags called scuttle diplomacy Imagine the chagrin of the Reagan people so sensitive to the nuances of implanting sell in program titles when the President announced his idea for a defense in space against incoming missiles and the notion was headlined immediately as Reagans Star Wars Proposal The application of the movie title to the futuristic defense was buttressed by the Presidents earlier use of the phrase evil empire to describe the Soviet Unions imperialism which seemed identical to the empire lined up against the good guys in the George Lucas film Grimly Pentacrats jettisoned the phrase that had been used by the programs early defenders  High Frontier  which comes down to the acronymic Hifron no competition for Star Wars Instead bureaucrats in what can be charitably called a holding action described the idea as Strategic Defense Initiative or SDI this phrase has not really caught on and the initials do not form an acronym Some thought has been given to changing the countername to Strategic Initiative for Defense so that it could be called SID remembering that the Pentagon is on Shirley Highway but this acronym has a nebbishistic ring What to do The critics of the defense idea were having a field day with the builtin derision of Star Wars The President complained I wish whoever coined that expression would take it back again because it gives a false impression of what it is were talking about In his second Inaugural Address he came up with a lame substitute a security shield which like security guard is redundant The shield image was useful  a global or planetary shield describes the unaggressive weapon  but some of the Presidents advisers thought it promised too much One of them bitterly complained that they were up the laser river In this linguistic pickle the Administration on deep background is outreaching desperately It is looking for suggestions for the antidote to the poison in the name Star Wars which is what Andrei Gromyko who has never even seen the movie delights in calling our mindboggling new idea It is in the tradition of The New York Times that a great institution turn to its public for help of this kind Almost 90 years ago when All the News Thats Fit to Print was first suggested for The Timess slogan a contest was conducted to come up with a better idea Thousands of entries were submitted The winning slogan was All the World News but not a School for Scandal a play on the title of Richard Brinsley Sheridans 1777 comedy As it happened the publisher kept the original suggestion so the motto is still All the News Thats Fit to Print but the involvement of the public always gives a nice sense of participation In that spirit the Lexicographic Irregulars are called upon now to help the Administration find a suitable and catchy name for what lets face it everybody calls the Star Wars program Here is the current state of play the President is down for security shield no acronym The Pentagon has its chips on the Strategic Defense Initiative initials SDI I like global shield no acronym The Charles River gang up at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which poohpoohs the program prefers to stick with Star Wars They are also stuck with MAD the acronym for Mutual Assured Destruction which describes their strategic deterrence They now realize that MAD is even worse than LOST and almost as bad as Creep Armscontrol types within the Administration who call themselves arms reduction specialists are toying with such ideas as the lowkey Study of Protection acronym STOP and the strained Security Assured for Each SAFE In a New York Times interview the President floated out a play on MAD Why dont we have MAS instead  Mutual Assured Security MAS may not fly  it sounds vaguely Marxist and looks like an incomplete version of MASH Here is your chance dear nuclearhappy reader for armscontrol immortality terminology division The prize for the best name for a substitute for Star Wars if it leads to adoption by the Administration will be an invitation to accompany me on my next private luncheon at the White House an event that may never take place Send your entries to Star Wars on Language The New York Times Washington Bureau 1000 Connecticut Avenue NW Washington DC 20036 Here is one already submitted even as this copy is being filed ZYD a legitimate acronym because the Y can be a vowel sound standing for Zap Youre Dead Come on now  no more of those Space defense is

THEIR SIMPLE ASPIRATIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/books/their-simple-aspirations.html,THE CORMANY DIARIES A Northern Family in the Civil War Edited by James C Mohr Richard E Winslow 3d associate editor 597 pp Pennsylvania University of Pittsburgh Press 3295 HISTORIANS like everyone else write with an eye on the public prints Our own deeply cynical age suspicious of heroes and intensely private has produced history that is often personal aggressively pluralistic and peculiarly apolitical Indeed the great thrust of recent historical studies has been the reconstruction of the lives of the pasts majority The lives of men and women who were not celebrated in their own day for either great words or deeds but who rose each morning and did the work of the world have moved from the background to the foreground of the modern historical narrative To recapture the experiences of these generally anonymous individuals historians have devised a variety of complex and ingenious techniques ranging from demographic reconstructions to econometric modeling Such methodology has allowed scholars to explore the marrow of daily life and to wrestle social history from the antiquarians giving institutions whose origins were believed to be mired in a primordial past  the family for instance  a central role in understanding our own time Yet the new techniques have become so complex and often so cumbersome that at times they have muffled rather than amplified the distant voices The diaries of Rachel and Samuel Cormany  hers kept from the autumn of 1858 through the summer of 1865 his from the spring of 1859 through the summer of 1865  reconfirm the fact that men and women of modest ambition and accomplishment spoke with a loud clear voice while at the same time providing commonplace details of the American past And because these diaries are so unobtrusively edited by James C Mohr they are also within easy reach of anyone interested in recapturing the flavor and substance of mid19thcentury American life Yet their narrow focus reveals the weakness of history viewed only from the perspective of what has come to be called personal politics The Cormanys were immersed in the great events of their day the triumph of evangelical Christianity the westward march of white settlement and the omnipresent sectional conflict of the Civil War But Samuel as a minister pioneer and soldier and Rachel as a congregant pioneer and soldiers wife hardly believed they made a ripple in the flow of American life Standing before Appomattox placing the last nail in the Confederate coffin as a member of the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry Samuel acted more like a spectator craning for a glimpse of Gen Ulysses S Grant the real historical figure Nowhere in their voluminous account of the Civil War era do either Samuel or Rachel stop to speculate on the nation they are making or the one they are destroying One searches their diaries in vain for a wellturned phrase that captures something of the spirit of the age The Cormanys were too much a part of their world to reflect upon it These liabilities are the immediate strength of the Cormany Diaries for anyone interested in the private concerns of the men and women who people our past My guess is that this emphasis drew Mr Mohr whose Abortion in America is the standard historical text to the diaries For if the Cormanys rarely debate the burning issues of slavery and freedom or race and nationality they do provide invaluable testimony about the nature of the education  formal and informal  family life and work habits of Northern men and women at midcentury Because Mr Mohr cleverly counterposes Rachels and Samuels accounts in alternating chapters the Cormany Diaries provide the bonus of contrasting the diverging world of a man and a woman who grew up in closely related evangelical sects in Ohio and Pennsylvania attended the same school  Otterbein University a United Brethren school in Westerville Ohio north of Columbus  and became enmeshed in the same blood war The Cormany Diaries affirm the importance of the family for understanding the evolution of American society In one way or another family ties shaped the Cormanys education provided a platform for their courtship helped finance the establishment of their household tutored them in the mysteries of childrearing and guided their careers until they could provide similar assistance for other struggling young couples Not surprisingly relations with their kin by blood and by marriage preoccupy Rachel and Samuel They are forever visiting and entertaining their relatives and when they are not shuttling back and forth a neverending stream of correspondence keeps everyone informed Remove the Cormanys kinfolk from these diaries and this stout volume shrinks to a thin battle narrative of Samuels military service The diaries provide an intimate view of Northern family life While neither Rachel nor Samuel have much of a flair for language by the weight of the prose alone they make their aspirations triumphs and heartbreaks known Their blustering self promotion their quiet statements of principle their petty squabbles or their tender debates over the size of the family convey that most elusive of historical qualities the texture of everyday life Still the family may not have been the only choice even for so loving a couple as Rachel and Samuel A proud feisty young woman eager to outshine the boys in chemistry class at college Rachel seems to have wanted more than the domestic routine that defined the lives of her mother and her aunts But after a disheartening stay in New York City searching for a job and a bruising stint as a schoolmarm in rural Pennsylvania domestic life and Samuels affection grew more attractive Soon she is cooing about the virtues of domesticity as if reciting the text of Godeys Ladys Book THE larger forces of American life transform the Cormanys in other ways as well The war changes Samuel and Rachel Military service in the increasingly triumphant Union Army emboldened Samuel as he rose from the rank of private to lieutenant and regimental adjutant Flushed with his new selfesteem he ventured into parts of the world that had previously been offlimits With suitable selfrecrimination he violated his own pledge against tippling hard cider and flirting with Southern women before returning home to his loving wife Meanwhile Rachels world narrowed As she shuffled from relative to relative the family seemed more an instrument of oppression than of support Lonely and deeply depressed she came to depend more and more on Samuels hopedfor return to give meaning to her life The wars different effect on the lives of Samuel and Rachel Cormany suggests the danger of seeing the 19th century as merely the sum total of private lives The Cormanys selective account provides a healthy corrective to many of the themes of the new history At the same time they offer a clear view of a loving couple whose simple aspiration to be worthy of their family their neighbors and their God commands continued respect

at the Filmmuseum there and as in France the deep wet embrace of at least part of the countrys film intellectuals As enterprises go the tour was an intriguing one bones being consciously fitted under the flesh of Clint Eastwoods new public embodiment as a very important American film maker As cultural or political phenomena go it was plain fascinating Until a couple of years ago Eastwood actor or director had been consistently reviled as a cinematic caveman a lowbrow and lunkhead credited with a single frightening trick his Dirty Harry cop pictures seemed to tap straight into the part of the American psyche where the nations brutal simplistic and autocratic reflexes were stored The great foul audience guzzling diet cola and wolfing down whole cartons of Milk Duds had been seduced into roaring with base delight as Dirty Harry cleaned up murderers the authorities would have left free If you paid attention to many of the critics this was doityourself justice and pandering to redneck

Airport outside London and Eastwood is being asked to talk a bit about respect and his new respectability about being deemed vulnerable generous and terribly significant almost overnight at age 54 He comes at answers slowly hedging digressing stalling artfully until he figures out what he wants to say A man with a good mind and a good memory he has a knack for suspending a question like leaving a pot at the edge of burner before pushing it back on the fire when he is good and ready The Munich segment Eastwood agrees keeping the pot well from the flame had not really followed the serious philosophy of the tour a Warner Brothers PR mans expression but he considers it no great loss because it had degenerated amusingly There was a Spanish countess who had gotten to interview him asking questions about whether he wanted to act with Greta Garbo  Who me I dont have a foot fetish comes Eastwoods exhausted reply  and there was a television appearance on a variety show with an MC described by Lennie Hirshan Eastwoods agent as the kind of guy Dirty Harry would have shot if he had the opportunity It could have been Joe Franklin on a Tuesday afternoon the actors TV slot was between a kid who was going to see how long he could swim in an icy river and a rock group called the Kane Gang A flack named Horst who had been specifically told that Eastwood did not want to receive a plaque on the show a fanmag job and not consistent with the new filmarchives image jimmied open a cars trunk to make sure he got one The Warner Brothers jet descends and the conversation flattens no clear answers at hand A digital altimeter on the passengercabin bulkhead ticks down 800 700 500 Nothing to see through the windows except basic black At 400 feet a strange nonsound a sense of nonmotion envelops the cabin It is as if the jet engines had been cut and the aircraft is adrift and powerless Suddenly the plane tilts backward and the passengers are jolted against the backs of the seats The Gulfstream pulls up hard and away A reporter on the tour realizing that the plane had dropped to ground level and then backed off when the pilot noticed the airport was invisible broke into a terrified sweat When he looked around he saw Eastwood climbing out of his seat and heading for the cockpit He was gone quite a while and during that time the reporter remembering that Eastwood as a soldier in the 1950s had been in a plane that crashlanded off northern California thought that if he were going to see the man at all well here was his shot The plane ran through its approach again the altimeter blinked down and the runway lights finally broke through the black Eastwood returned Were you scared he was asked No he said Either Eastwood was wholly bogus a liar which seemed unlikely or he was answering the question about vulnerability and explaining why so many people attach their fantasies to him and why certain others have detested him so completely I just went up to watch the pilots work he said Painful as it may be to some of his new admirers Eastwood seems to be exactly what hes told us about himself as Dirty Harry or Josey Wales cool resolved in control selfreliant somehow not quite in reach No need to read him too deeply No need to chisel tortured ambiguity restlessness into the granite of the distant heros face With Clint Eastwood you get what you see what youve always seen Up close now bearded Eastwoods face has something legendary about it Driving past the Houses of Parliament in London someone says that there is a statue of Abraham Lincoln there and someone else recalls a man telling Eastwood that he looks more like Lincoln these days than Dirty Harry The remark seems to make him uncomfortable He says nothing He looks out the window Needled kidded treated like a thirdrater for so long respected so late he is essentially a wary man He finds none of Dirty Harrys easy derision no oneline dart to call on to make the Lincoln talk disappear Eastwood is condemned to saying what he thinks You know he says after a while Id like to know what the economics of that were I mean freeing the slaves Id like to know what was behind it HAT IS THIS JERK doing directing films were not going to like when we dont even like him as an actor Clint Eastwood said that of himself recently trying to sum up the prevailing critical view of his work over the last 15 years Its an old story The cover of Life magazine on July 23 1971 carried the actors picture and the caption The worlds favorite movie star is  no kidding  Clint Eastwood Mostly Clint Eastwood has been a surprise and afterthought even to himself He comes from an America where it is bad form to take yourself with gravity to sound too analytical an America that will accept risk and loss but likes pretense as little as it likes being pushed around In hours of talking the phrase the body of my work comes out of his mouth once and he looks embarrassed as if he wants it right back so grand and unlike him does it sound He does not treat the metaphysical in any conventional way and does not make movies for dealers in subtexts deepreaders or people writing term papers his films work backward in terms of theme They are stories first ones with human relationships that make Eastwood feel comfortable later someone perhaps himself can come and say that one is about loyalty or about responsibility Eastwoods thought process he explains runs to small units frame after frame Its the way the family was he says looking for an irony My dads dream was to have a hardware store Im his son The pride is there but the doubts dilute it every day Did you once describe yourself as a bum and a drifter someone asked him in Paris No Eastwood answered Then what are you A bum and a drifter That was Paris and the line was not so much thrown but flipped away in Eastwoods modified Smothers Brothers California deadpan But the subject returned in London and Eastwood rubbed it again a man massaging an old ache that he assumes will last as long as he does Wherever I came from I always came out of left field I wasnt predicted to do anything So it was easy to say that this guy was going nowhere And then when he does try to do something maybe that disappoints the soothsayers whove decided his type isnt supposed to do anything at all His pride his sense of what is right is intense and at times it comes close to a kind of puritanism For an extraordinarily rich man he gets extravagantly upset about the money and time spent on making films His own financed and distributed by Warner Brothers and usually made by Malpaso his production company are expedited as if there were Oscars for the fastest shoots and most firsttakes to reach a final print For a man who lives in the very protected elegance of Carmel Calif his clothes often look like K Mart and Sears but this could be a kiss blown at his audience the people who came to Clint Eastwood pictures when Rex Reed was describing them as a demented exercise in Hollywood hackery Talking to people he is gracious tolerant almost courtly But he wants to be left alone about his former wife whom he divorced after 25 years of marriage and his friend Sondra Locke the actress who frequently appears in his films Little bits of himself work loose though Im always appalled just knocked out by disloyalty he says I never think its coming He tends to trust people and sometimes wonders why I was driving around my place in Carmel and I saw this guy and his girl camping on it I thought What the hell theyre probably having a great time let em stay Later I went back and they had left the place a mess I felt I had been had When he talks about actors and films he likes the names are not the Waynes and the Stewarts like himself the redwoods of the American movies Instead they are Montgomery Clift and James Cagney Simone Signoret and Maggie Smith Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and Breaker Morant His descriptions of them are kind but cool with Eastwood saving his passions for his audience the single element along with his instincts that he seems to trust totally I never secondguess audiences because many times theyre just so much further ahead of you And then sometimes they miss what you think youve been explaining so simply So you cant secondguess All you do is build on your own instinctive reactions That tells you what to do You do it the best way you know how and you hope of course that somebody likes it He insists he is no great intellect and is uncomfortable with analyzing things too much It is not a sham retreat by an intelligent man into some kind of yokelism but a very measured view of his own skills He has always cut dialogue out of his films and limited exposition because he feels the audience will catch on without it Eastwood describes acting and directing as interpretive functions activities at a somewhat lower rung on his creative scale than writing a script He waits for scripts rather than commissioning them on a theme that interests him The character of Dirty Harry for example was developed from a story by Harry Julian Fink and RM Fink The script was originally meant for Frank Sinatra but he got sick and Eastwood took over the project changing the personality of the detective His next film Pale Rider a western is an exception to the pattern  Eastwoods notion of a theme came first and the movie was written to fit it When he says he can pick out a good script but does not have the ability to write one from scratch it is as if he is drawing lines and saying This is me This isnt me My limitations are real He harbors considerable anger against the critics who described him as an apologist for violence and nonothingism Those are the kind of people who become dictators and think they should run everybody Theres an awful lot of people out there who want to tell everybody else what to do    Theyre always thinking in terms of all those poor lonely people who dont know anything out there Its just a giant ego running around    Theyre putting themselves above and looking down saying this is what the masses see Eastwood insists that he does not fully understand the reversal in the critical current about his work The pattern of his films has not changed over the years  a smaller more detailed more complicated film and then a popular one broader in approach the kind of enterprise that Graham Greene refers to as an entertainment as opposed to a novel The same critics who notice that Wes Block the cop in Tightrope is vulnerable and has problems may not have paid much attention to the fact that Josey Wales almost 10 years earlier had problems too His entire family was wiped out by marauders Sometimes Eastwood says he has the impression a couple of gray hairs dont hurt Other times he assumes that the relative lack of commercial success of a couple of his more ambitious films probably has been a positive factor  Some critics just dont approve of too much effective screen presence or too much success There is also the accumulation of continued effort No one in Hollywood of any stature works as much or is as completely involved in every aspect of film making Politics count he knows and he acknowledges without elaborating that a change in the American and European political mood toward one closer to his conservative instincts has probably played a role in the critical reassessment But the labels and tag words irritate him because he feels they have done him harm I dont know I dont have an explanation other than the fact that maybe there were certain prejudices in the times of Dirty Harry in 1971 that dont exist now or are changing now or times are changing Maybe Im older more mature maybe the audiences are changing and Im changing Its just circumstances Eastwood insists he is not sure how much he is enjoying the new respectability  maybe yes in the back of my mind but Ill hedge it  and the reason could be that a lot of it may be based on what looks like a willful swelling a puffing up by critics of what he wants to say The respect is there now and Eastwood cares about it but with it came the liberal behind the Magnum headlines and the kind of phrases like the ones in the Cinemath eque presentation that better fit what the critics would like to see than what Eastwood has offered One of the articles tacked on the hommage insisted that if Eastwood were to do a film on the Vietnam War he would be on the side of the Vietnamese people of course just like he has been minus any sentimentalism on the side of the Indian and black minorities Eastwood is reminded of this and his face stays blank When he thinks about the last few years he makes other points I never begged for respectability I never said Come let me show you come like me Then what do you need this trip for someone asks Its nice to come to Europe Its nice to hear people say nice things isnt it CLINT EASTWOOD grew up in about 10 different places in California in the Depression as his parents moved around looking for work He was not an Okie he says and never went hungry being told instead to eat everything on his plate and to think about the starving Armenians He went to high school in Oakland in a bluecollar neighborhood that also produced Billy Martin the baseball manager and other Dirty Harrys Nobody ever told him he was smart or promising The Army got to Eastwood around the time of Korea but he taught swimming and made friends with guys who wanted to be actors He wound up in Los Angeles and started LA City College on the GI Bill He pumped gas and emptied garbage cans Universal Studios hiring young flesh as contract players gave him a job for 75 a week He got bit parts in giant tarantula and Francis the Talking Mule movies Eventually Universal let him go but he got a role in Rawhide a new television series that lasted seven years and it brought him professional skills and a kind of national popularity In 1964 Eastwood went to Europe packing his own poncho sixshooter and little cigars to make Fistful of Dollars the first of three films that became known as spaghetti westerns Conceived by Sergio Leone the Italian director they produced the Eastwood personage and a controversy that was to run with modifications into the present through the Dirty Harry films As The Man With No Name Eastwood was a western hero without the westerns traditional heroic characteristics He had no sense of chivalry no sense of regret and an approach to a witheringly violent world that could be justified as ludicrously ironic or condemned as a hired guns cynicism and amorality Enormously successful outside the United States but little more than cult pictures at home the Leone westerns were drawn so large cut so close to a grand guignol model in their freaky disproportions and blackcomedy excessiveness that it took a determined intellectual effort not to classify them as parody If you were going to force a Great Metaphysical Theme onto the films a reasonable argument might have been this one that they offered a consciously fantastic and absurd nonreply to the dilemma of finding the right response for violence that is insane and absurd But Pauline Kael the eminent critic of The New Yorker fused what she saw as the immorality of the spaghetti westerns with the Eastwood character of Harry Callahan the San Francisco detective who represented the actors first stunning success in the United States in 1971 and his entry into the arena of politics and myth Turning her view of their message into Eastwoods view of the world she wrote A tall cold cod like Eastwood removes the last pretensions to humane feelings from the action melodrama    He is offering a man who essentially stands for nothing but violence a hero of a totally nihilistic dream world What Dirty Harry did in the 1970s was to outrun an American political phenomenon by close to a decade In the series involving the rebellious detective Eastwood caught a mood of bluecollar discontent with a country portrayed in the films as being run by bureaucrats sociologists appeasers and incompetents American societys deepest incapacity the Dirty Harry films said was in failing to protect the normal lives of its normal people and its most galling trait was rationalizing crime and the intolerable with guidancecounselor jargon In the films the country is reduced to the scale of San Francisco and Dirty Harry roams the city defying the bureaucracy and restoring order Better than anything else Eastwood as Harry transmits a mixture of irony and outrage about the fact that he a reasonable kind of guy in a Sears Roebuck sport coat should have to be going through all this Harry responds to the mess with a very theatrical distance a kind of hypercoldness and if you watch the films again it is about as hard to take Harry literally as it is the almostcampy Eastwood of the spaghetti westerns In retrospect the argument might be that all the killing was really copfilm convention and that now with the wind blowing the other way on Eastwood no one gets morally outraged when a woman is stuffed into a clothes dryer in Tightrope his much praised recent film But theres more Whats lasted from the Dirty Harry movies and really gone from them into American folk culture isnt the hecatomb but Harrys cool and with it the films sense that submission to violence is as morally reprehensible as creating it The films say it is possible not to cower Looking at a gunman and wondering how many shots he has left in his Magnum Eastwood says Youve gotta ask yourself one question Do you feel lucky    Well do ya punk In another film he eggs a thug on telling him Come on punk make my day To use the antiEastwood critics frame of reference these are fantasies of omnipotence a phrase that doesnt fit Eastwoods style but one whose reality he acknowledges Is Dirty Harry political Yes of course Is Dirty Harry fascist as Pauline Kael has suggested Ask the black audience with whom Eastwood has had enormous popularity The answer instead may be that Dirty Harry  like Eastwoods Josey Wales  deals mainly with the audiences fears its outrage at having to exhaust itself in steering clear of trouble and Harrys example as someone refusing to bend or to run In the context of the early 1970s in terms of Americas view of itself then Dirty Harry wasnt a fascist but a romantic and a rather subversive one By 1980 measured against the changes in the American political mood Dirty Harrys message looked vastly more ordinary Ronald Reagan had become President and Clint Eastwood obviously had voted for him The success of the Dirty Harry series turned Eastwood into one of the great rich traditional stars of the American film industry without making him an acceptable or even interesting personality for a very substantial part of the intellectual community that sets the countrys cultural standards In 1976 after Eastwood directed the western High Plains Drifter an article in Esquire by Bruce Jay Friedman the novelist and playwright talked reverently about his mythic qualities Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice wrote favorably about his work But the tone of reviewers usually had a disbelieving edge In Europe expressing a liking for Eastwood once described by the left wing Le Nouvel Observateur as the reactionary antidote to the liberal young lions Hoffman and Redford was akin to lining up with barbarianism The acting is a riot said Rex Reed of High Plains Drifter The direction by Eastwood is as interesting and as mobile as the rear end of Eastwoods horse Ive seen better westerns at the Pepsi Cola Saloon in Disneyland In the next years Eastwood alternated movies aimed at mass audiences with smaller more personal films One of these Bronco Billy a film about a Wild West show troupe followed Every Which Way But Loose and Any Which Way You Can Eastwoods two orangutan movies Honkytonk Man his film about the deterioration of a country singer during the Depression  his first picture that did not make money  was quickly compensated by Sudden Impact the latest Dirty Harry which took in great amounts of cash Somewhere in the early 1980s the tidal flow had reversed and Eastwood directing films since Play Misty For Me 1971 found himself being described as a man with an oeuvre Bronco Billy a favorite when the Museum of Modern Art in New York offered its Eastwood retrospective in 1980 is a fascinating example of how a filmmakers work can be coopted by critics who have decided on their own terms that he is to be treated kindly Caught in the French reembrace of all things American after decades of institutionalized antiAmericanism Les Cahiers du Cinema probably the worlds most hyperintellectualized film review spoke of Eastwoods self parodying subtlety and his perfectly sincere humility in Bronco Billy while describing the films collection of losers as people who have transcended the boredom of daily life and chosen to live in a universe of poetry and the imagination It is a partially blind read of the film In rehabilitating Clint Eastwood and making him fit for Guardian lectures and Chevalier des Arts et Lettres lapel ribbons it skips over the Eastwood who was the center of so much scorn all these years and who while finding different tones and nuances hasnt changed so enormously Bronco Billy the twobit Wild West show hero never looks more angry or less tolerant than when his friend tells him he deserted from the Army in Vietnam When a bunch of kids at an orphanage ask him if he ever kills anybody Bronco Billy explains no and then adds in what is almost an aside to the theater audience well not unless its absolutely necessary When Bronco Billy allows himself to be humiliated by a policeman to get his deserter friend off the hook the very oldfashioned message is one of loyalty and friendship And the movie itself is wildly patriotic urging everyone to dream Big American Dreams The little cowboy show is saved when the inmates of a home for the criminally insane sew them a new big top stitched together from hundreds of American flags If critics are going to take Clint Eastwood seriously they are missing the point if they ignore the final joyous scenes of the Bronco Billy troop reunited under a crazy quilt of red white and blue stars and stripes I wanted to say something about everybody being able to participate Eastwood said America is the maddest idea in the world put together by madmen So here comes this tent I suppose other people see America as a collage of crazies Well maybe we are kind of hard to fathom THE EUROPEAN ACcolade and adulation tour bumped forward Looking back from London things had gone well but imperfectly On one hand as if by common accord nobody mentioned City Heat the rather recent blip below the median line of what Positif another ambitious French film publication grandly described as Eastwoods ability to totally control his audience and his own universe both stylistically and mythologically On the other hand in Paris Jack Lang the Minister of Culture had another engagement and could not make it to the Cinemath eque award ceremony Lennie Hirshan took the green chevalier ribbon anyway and later threaded it through the buttonhole of one of Eastwoods Dirty Harry corduroy jackets A man quietly checked the list of other American cultural chevaliers of the Mitterrand era They included Myron Karlin and Sidney Sheinberg studio executives at Warner and Universal the investigator decided not to tell Eastwood John Huston became a member of the order in 1984 but with a higher rank commander Maybe the French were still not convinced about Eastwoods perfection The Germans who followed one another into Eastwoods suite at the Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich asked the actor continuously about the New York subway vigilante One young man apparently hoping to nail Eastwood as a fascist or to pronounce him reformed and contrite  Eastwood would later call the visitor the Wehrmacht lieutenant  failed on both scores Eastwood insisted there was something pretty significant about the wave of sympathy for the vigilante he also said he didnt approve of people shooting other people because their dog had urinated on their lawn a line he pointed out that came from a 10yearold Dirty Harry picture In London the Daily Mail noting that Europe was suddenly discovering Eastwoods hidden depths announced his arrival with the headline Dirty Harry Gets Arty Lord Snowdon was waiting for him having turned two rooms at Claridges into photographic studios As you know Eastwoods typed itinerary said Snowdon is one of most respected portrait photographers working today His family connections on his wifes side his first wifes side are also not to be sneezed at  The photographer asked the actordirector to wear black for his pictorial immortalization He said he was thinking of doing a photo book about stars titled very tentatively Twinkle Twinkle A man from The Guardian came furiously intent on liking Eastwood but on his own terms At first he seemed hopeful that Eastwood would say that his film Honkytonk Man was about the death of the American Dream He did not it was not Then he seemed interested in drawing Eastwood into confessing that his own youth was hard and bleak and perhaps from there into some psychopolitical construct a 54yearold man finally coming to terms with his youth and the working class Eastwood would not bite he chewed on an apple instead and told a couple of companions later that he saw that failed American Dream stuff coming a mile away Wherever he went the bottomline question was really whether he was going to be President of the United States The question usually came cautiously wrapped maybe with a reference to an actor President who also had been upstaged in a movie by a monkey costar but the intent was serious And why not So many people were finding so much in him coopting the details that made them feel comfortable ignoring the rest Clint Eastwood Very unfreaky likes Oskar Werner and Amadeus and jazz works out every day or displays a Californians fascination about diet fish extract thyons and things called cholines owns a bunch of expensive cars thinks hunting is obsolete or rather likes guns says he worries about the environment fears losing his luggage in airports and photographed right looks not entirely unlike Abraham Lincoln After all Eastwood had already laid out his positions It was clear from Firefox another blip under the Cinemath eque median of high artistic achievement that Eastwood did not trust the Russians much although not in any obsessive proportions since he believed that John Miliuss Red Dawn described widely as of the loonyright and paranoid was not a very good movie The nation knew where he stood on law and order and Honkytonk Man a film set unromantically in the Depression made it clear he didnt approve of poverty as a builder of character the problem in helping the poor was education and incentive he said His audience was aware he voted for Nixon and Eastwood described Reagan as a very nice guy  I like him He was a Republican he acknowledged but not doctrinaire defining people with very ideological positions as the most boring guys in the world The righttolife groups made him nervous since they seem to lead to people bombing abortion clinics and the bornagain types did too since how could Clint Eastwood be sure or the Russians for that matter that one of them near the nuclear trigger might not decide that everyone atheists excluded would be much happier in the hereafter He felt strongly about civil rights he said and he felt strongly about the need for less government and fewer taxes Eastwood also felt he knew something about America perhaps in the way that a Lee Iacocca or a mailman or a mechanic did In the last elections he saw that Mondale was going to all these fringe groups but he forgot about the people in the middle Mr and Mrs America out there were saying What is this about We dont care about that What about us  And he noticed other things When he was planning to film Escape From Alcatraz in the 1970s he sought permission from the National Park Service to use the abandoned prison island turned into a park In order to film we promised to clean the place up to paint it That meant in particular painting over the graffiti that was left behind by Indians who occupied the island in a protest thing The Eastwood squint narrowed his portrayal of reason about to clash with nonsense So we did our little presentation and the Park Service guy said No no you cant paint that over Its part of our history Eastwood let his view of the world sink in It is not Dirty Harry outrage but a kind of canyoubelievethis look that assumes total agreement Well thats the way the country was he said Eventually he explains he convinced people to let him paint and restore the buildings on Alcatraz and he seems now to look back at the situation as if it had some kind of symbolic value a little victory for what he considers good sense I think things have changed a bit in the meanwhile he said Straight no subtext But there was a problem Ive never thought of myself as    first of all I wouldnt be able to operate in that kind of     Why someone asked  Cause Im not    Because you arent a liar I guess I can lie like anybody else but I dont like it Id hate to exist constantly day in dayout having to come up with something Having to come up with something whether its the truth a variation of the truth or whether its an outright lie or variations on a lie The Presidency talk amused him he said but what I think was being referred to was just a physical look a look that he thought might inspire some sort of credibility with the public Its just thinking out loud I dont think its meant to say I am the best prepared Im probably the least prepared Eastwood smiled The next question was Would you have liked to make movies with Greta Garbo SOMEPLACE DURING the award ceremony at the Cinemath eque the movie museum in the Palais de Chaillot Pierre Viot who made the presentation began to talk about the abyss of perplexity that Eastwood had created for reviewers and students of film He threw in a couple of references to paradoxes heroes and antiheroes to an America that is not summarily Manichaean construction or destruction contradictions and even quoted a Dirty Harry line  Im afraid youve got the wrong idea about me Somebody hunting for a paradox might have sought to look at Eastwoods face at that moment The oils of annointment were being poured on full force but he was being drowned in explanations that didnt reflect Eastwood as much as an intellectual establishments difficulties in classifying him  and its race to mark him down matured reformed liberal or whatever The joke was close to enormous The strained exegesis of Eastwood and his work mostly showed the impossibility of his existing as a man who is what he seems Now Eastwood had got institutionalized respect but at a price being told about representing 17 levels of ambiguity and enigma and then as the most popular film star in the world hearing Mr Viot tack on a peculiar indignity You really are someone he told Eastwood You really have something to say Later a man would ask Eastwood a question he asked a couple of times before What did you go through all this for Well its like this Eastwood said his voice the same soft monotone of all his films of Bronco Billy of Josey Wales of Harry Callahan Theyre pretty nice people And I hadnt been in Europe for a while
NEW UNIT FOR RETARDED OFFERS TRAINING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/nyregion/new-unit-for-retarded-offers-training.html,WHEN the Association for the Help of Retarded Children dedicates its new day training center in Brookville today Helen Kaplan will be a step closer to her goal As a leader of the agency for the last 36 years she has made it the associations stated objective to provide for the retarded from the cradle to the grave  The new center will provide training for 250 retarded adolescents and adults who cannot work either in sheltered workshops or outside employment Here they can learn survival skills socialization and selfcare said Mrs Kaplan who plans to retire in June as director of the associations Nassau Chapter  The organizations Long Island Chapter which split into Nassau and Suffolk units was born in 1949 when Mrs Kaplan joined a group of parents who were frustrated because their retarded children were institutionalized in their own homes because schools and clinics would not serve them Although her son David was in a private school she soon found herself devising programs to fill the void these families faced There was nothing for the trainable or profoundly retarded when we started she said and only a few classes for the educable  Children are termed educable or mildly retarded if their IQ is between 50 and 75 Those with IQs of 30 to 50 are known as trainable or severely retarded They can be taught selfcare and work skills Those below the 30 IQ level termed profoundly retarded require constant care The educable represent about 85 percent of the retarded population in the United States the trainable about 14 percen and the profoundly retarded 1 percent according to the association The organization began by setting up two demonstration classes to prove to the State Education Department that trainable children could benefit from education given the proper curriculum Eventually the association bought the mansion and grounds of a large estate in Brookville for its headquarters and school In 1967 the Brookville Center was dedicated to the memory of David Kaplan who died of leukemia at the age of 10 In many ways the creation of the new center has called on the same talents that Mrs Kaplan contributed to the agencys growth in the last three decades raising substantial funds developing a program and having the political skill and persistence to see it through The building of the center was held up for 12 years in a dispute with the Village of Brookville and Federal funds ran out before it could be completed requiring a major fundraising effort I think it was Calvin Coolidge who said Persistence is the mother of genius  Mrs Kaplan said and was he ever right  Mrs Kaplans persistence combined with a sharp political sense has been rewarded often The walls of her office are lined with framed copies of laws she has helped pass including the establishment of an Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities in the state government She has crossed swords with Governors commissioners and legislators and won most of her battles  Whatever progress has been made in the laws to help the retarded in this state has primarily been due to Helens efforts said Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer of Long Beach She has been a onewoman lobbying effort for bills for programs and for dollars Mr Kremer who is chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee echoed the sentiments of other political leaders who have dealt with Mrs Kaplan over the years Shes a tough lady She lets you know where she stands at all times She can be a little crusty in her speech but you have to like her and you have to respect her  Although she assumes a grandmotherly demeanor as she tours the centers classrooms eliciting smiles and cries of I know you from the students she minces no words in her skirmishes with the state bureaucracy We put our money in as well as the tax money she said The state has everything to say and we have nothing to say Its grossly unfair She calls New York the most overregulated state in the country although she acknowledges that many of the regulations were spawned by programs she helped to legislate Samuel La Magna director of the educational training program at the association said The state as a support mechanism came about as a result of parents saying We need help Unfortunately the state programs dont reflect that original need As it turned out the programs took on a life of their own The state is obsessed with accountability which they define as paperwork Mrs Kaplan said Forty cents of every dollar of professional time is spent on paperwork thats doing no one any good She also has strong criticism for opponents of abortion a choice made by many women who learn they are carrying a child who will be handicapped Some people will fight to the death for the fetus and not care a tinkers damn about the child she said Unless the Government is willing to pick up the cost of providing for a very profoundly handicapped infant they have no right to insist on saving the life of the infant knowing it will totally impoverish the family One measure of the importance of her political skills to the association is its choice for Mrs Kaplans successor Beginning next Friday Roberta Marks a New York State official and former director of the American Civil Liberties Union on Long Island will assume the duties of executive director working alongside Mrs Kaplan until she officially retires in June  As the association grew Mrs Kaplan sought to build a community base to raise funds and promote awareness of mental retardation She recruited volunteers to form 23 auxiliaries numbering more than 8000 families in Nassau making it the associations largest chapter in the country At least 6000 of these families have no retarded child Mrs Kaplan said Parents of retarded children would only make up 2 to 3 percent of the population You cant grow on 2 to 3 percent We had to go into the community to get nonparents to help Its the same way you build a political machine Terri Tardera whose family has been involved with the association and its auxiliaries since its inception said The majority of people who have absolutely no relation to a retarded child volunteer and really work because they realize it could happen to anybody The auxiliaries raise over half a million dollars a year and have contributed most of the funds for the new day center The Five Towns auxiliary contributed 125 million to the center which will be named the Cissy BirnbaumFive Towns Day Training Center in memory of one of the auxiliarys founders  Because of the strength of its fund raising efforts as well as Government support the association is able to provide most of its services without charge These include education diagnosis vocational training and recreation programs There is a fee for the summer camp but scholarships are also provided so that no one is turned away because of inability to pay The associations financial report shows only 3 percent of its budget going to administration making it attractive to donors who want to see most of their funds channeled directly to services  The agency also operates two sheltered workshop complexes one in Freeport and one in Plainview These centers employ more than 700 retarded adults paying weekly salaries based on a piecework rate for light assembly riveting and packaging A small number of them go on to jobs in competitive industry thus becoming selfsupporting  The new day center will add another dimension to the agencys services for young men and women who are aging out of school programs As medical advances increase life expectancy for many retarded children the problem of providing for a growing population of handicapped adults has worsened Employment services and housing have not kept pace with the retarded population whose parents have died or who are unable to care for them With the day center completed Mrs Kaplans current battle is to address the housing shortage The association has opened a number of hostels to house adult retarded adults within the community but it still has a waiting list of 300 families To alleviate the delay Mrs Kaplan has proposed an apartment housing plan that would house 48 residents in a six unit complex  After her retirement Mrs Kaplan a resident of Old Westbury will remain

Setting the Stage for Famine,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/opinion/setting-the-stage-for-famine.html,There are countries that have far too many mouths to feed The photographs of Ethiopias starving children demonstrate the consequences of drought poor land use and overpopulation Yet two months ago the Reagan Administration which was quick to send Ethiopia shortterm help denied long term help that is needed just as much The Reagan Administration refused 17 million in aid to the International Planned Parenthood Federation because something less than 1 percent of its total funds  none of it Federal money  goes to abortionrelated services In so doing the Administration dealt a devastating blow to an organization that is the primary network for family planning programs all over the world The move wiped out the fragile web of such services in Ethiopia and caused the cancellation of planned programs in 17 other African countries Now the Administration wants to magnify that blow by placing similar conditions on American aid to many other nongovernmental program sponsors conditions that it could not legally impose on domestic organizations The Agency for International Development proposes a clause in all its contracts with populationplanning groups asking that they monitor not only the uses of the Federal aid but also of all funds they receive If any funds even if raised from private sources within the recipient country are used even to advise a woman about the availability of abortion the Federal money will be cut off Foreign governments would remain exempt from this proposal They are required only to keep funds provided by the Federal Government away from abortionrelated activities That perhaps is the shaky way the Administration plans to defend itself against charges of manipulating other countries population policies Unless Congress intervenes AIDs new contract will become one more tool in the antiabortion campaign Instead of promoting life the Administration will help to set the stage for yet more photographs of cadaverous children in yet another season of death

NEW JERSEY OPINION;   FAMILY LIFE-A SUCCESS STORY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-family-life-a-success-story.html,THE state policy requiring Family Life education programs in all publicschool districts comes up for reauthorization before the State Board of Education on Wednesday In preparation for that vote  on extending the policy for five more years  I would like to share with the board some of my findings My research is qualitative rather than quantitative and is based on several hundred stories from local newspapers I have compiled information on the implementation of the policy in some 200 school districts in all 21 counties from affluent suburban areas to poor urban ones The states Department of Education after monitoring 150 districts for compliance has called the policy a success My research substantiates this and will provide I hope an enlarged view of the policys effectiveness The policy resulted in a sunburst of new and revised Family Life and sexeducation programs at the elementary and junior high school levels of the 200 districts 117 reported the development of new programs and 30 mentioned revisions in existing ones Only 13 districts reported no change in existing programs Although the greatest development occurred in kindergarten through Grade 8 many districts  including Jersey City with the secondhighest enrollment in the state Paterson and Bayonne  developed new programs for kindergarten through Grade 12 In many districts there is a discernible shift to earlier introduction of information about human sexuality topics In Ridgewood material once taught in high school is now presented in the seventh grade in Salem material once taught only to seniors is now spread throughout the grades Most programs moreover present sexuality topics in the context of health and family issues and include information on responsible personal behavior The goals of the new Family Life education programs are surprisingly uniform across the state They indicate a strong desire by adults to help children and adolescents and they reflect adults beliefs that this type of education can help children increase their knowledge make decisions understand family responsibilities and gain selfesteem They also stress improved communication between children and parents and preparation for adulthood Adults seem less sure of which teaching strategies will achieve these commonly accepted goals strict factual pesentation of information or open discussion that encourages questions Teachers in many districts are admonished to avoid any discussion about moral and religious values they are advised to direct students to their families or churches for guidance in these matters Very little time is scheduled for Family Life education The longest course I found lasted 10 weeks and consisted of only one class session a week It was not unusual to read of programs in which 10 to 15 topics were covered in 10 hours No element of the states policy was more crucial to the development of new programs than the requirement for community involvement Countless citizens gave hours of their time to advise professionals and schoolboard members on program content Parents schoolboard members teachers doctors lawyers and a large number of clergy served on the committees It was not uncommon to see Catholic Protestant and Jew working together It was a labor of love one person said because we thought it was needed The efforts of committee members from the community strengthened the scope and sequence of many curriculums Bolder in general than school professionals they favored morecomprehensive curriculums earlier introduction of human sexuality topics and instruction in all the sensitive areas of sexuality They often lobbied for increased instructional time additional staff members and new textbooks Committee members suggestions were accepted in a high proportion of districts Parents also played an influential role in instituting policy Educators treated them as full partners and many activities were begun to assure them of the openness of the process and that curriculums were not cast in stone Public meetings at which parents reviewed curriculums were the rule not the exception Attendance at these meetings ran above normal at a meeting in Randolph Township Morris County 350 parents listened to a talk on Moral Sex Education in Millville 300 heard the school nurse describe the curriculum Undoubtedly such efforts contributed to keeping down the number of parents who exercised their option to remove children from the programs they constituted only a tiny fraction Actually the policy worked very democratically Because of the emphasis on local curriculum development the views of the majority were heeded In Westfield parents complained that their children were bored with a longstanding program they asked that it be updated to conform to state guidelines and that information on contraception be included In Columbus Burlington County a majority of parents requested separate classes for boys and girls for instruction in human sexuality a serious controversial issue in several school districts and the deletion of valuesclarification exercises on abortion The majoritys views were accepted in both districts The few districts that hired new staff people were the moreaffluent suburban ones The new employees  as well as many of those who have responsibility for Family Life education  are school nurses If the nurses are not the primary teachers which they seem to be at elementary and middleschool levels then they are often brought in to teach the sensitive issues of sexuality One administrator said he had chosen the school nurse because of her availability throughout the day to answer students questions Lack of funds similarly may explain the infrequent mention of training activities for teachers Although the regulations required local districts to provide training opportunities only a few programs were mentioned Most teachers attended day or halfday workshops rather than longer programs There is no question in my mind that the policy of the State Board of Education limited controversy at the local level It would have been impossible to produce such a profusion of programs in three years without the boards 1980 action A few local school boards passed final versions of the curriculums unanimously but in many others a minority voiced strong objections Without the state policy as a shield most board members might have been unwilling to face down the opposition and push through the programs State policy let the minority express its views but allowed the majority to achieve its goal Few local board members complained about the states directive and none to the best of my knowledge lost an election because of the introduction of Family Life education Schoolboard members administrators teachers parents and citizens tried to meet not only the letter of the law but also its spirit These diverse groups accepted a statewide directive and turned a few pieces of paper into functioning curriculums without any funds from the state Furthermore the basic components of the policy were followed carefully in almost all districts These groups need the continued protection of a state policy to give their new programs a chance for development Because the policy did not become fully operational until September 1983 many programs are tender shoots they require at least a fiveyear flowering before their effects on students can properly be assessed If the State Board of Education readopts the policy for a full fiveyear period it will enhance the lives of the children of our state
REAGAN'S SUPPORT IS KEY TO TAX SIMPLIFICATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/business/reagan-s-support-is-key-to-tax-simplification.html,AFTER preliminary oratorical flourishes in his State of the Union Message President Reagan turned to the issues of the day and the very first one he mentioned  before the deficit before war and peace before abortion and education and crime  was taxes Let us move together the President implored Congress with a historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth The present tax system he declared is unfair The Treasury Department the President said that day has produced an excellent reform plan whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact He added Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous pentup power of our economy It seemed to be a powerful endorsement of a controversial idea one of the most controversial of Mr Reagans Presidency  the notion that the entire Federal tax code should be scrapped and replaced by a system with much lower tax rates for individuals and businesses but with many fewer deductions and other tax preferences Exclusions and exemptions the President said cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels But in the next breath  in the same paragraph according to the official transcript  Mr Reagan asked Congress to pass his proposal for socalled enterprise zones where tax breaks would be offered to businesses to induce them to situate in designated poor neighborhoods A Congressional staff assistant who specializes in tax matters said later that he had watched Mr Reagans speech on television at home He gave his wife the thumbsup signal when he heard the Presidents remarks about tax simplification he said but moments later he was groaning as the President discussed enterprise zones Tax preferences in the form of enterprise zones would seem to run directly counter to the principles of tax simplification But much more important Mr Reagan has been talking about enterprise zones for years and has never thrown his considerable political weight behind the idea Enterprise zones in the past have fallen into the same category as the suggested Constitutional amendments to require a balanced budget and outlaw abortion staples of nearly every political speech but items hardly near the top of the Presidents agenda So the key question about taxreform prospects in the view of tax experts lobbyists and political analysts is whether the President pushes the case for overhauling the tax system with the same fervor that he showed four years ago in pressing for tax reductions cutbacks in social programs and increases in military spending  or whether he treats it the same way as enterprise zones balanced budgets and abortion Without the President said William M Diefenderfer staff director of the Senate Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over tax measures there arent four votes on the committee for tax reform With the President there arent four votes against it Some of the leading Congressional proponents of tax reform were encouraged by the State of the Union Message Immediately following the speech Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey sponsor of the leading Democratic tax measure said The President has given the tax debate a new sense of urgency His commitment to tax reform is critical and we heard it tonight Other Senators were less sure He got tax reform back on the front burner said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader The question Mr Dole noted wryly is whether the burner is lit A year earlier in his 1984 State of the Union Message the President announced that he had instructed his Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan to draft a plan for changing the tax system The directive was widely seen as a deft political ploy to enable the President to duck the issue of taxes during the election campaign Indeed whenever the matter was raised Mr Reagan said he did not want to take a stand until he saw what the Treasury recommended Three weeks after the election on Nov 27 the Treasury presented its plan which stunned politicians and academicians with its sweep The Treasury proposed abolishing the current codes multitude of tax brackets which range from 11 percent to 50 percent and instead taxing individuals at one of three rates  15 25 or 35 percent It proposed taxing all corporations at the same rate 33 percent down from 46 percent now To maintain revenue while reducing rates the Treasury would do away with most deductions and other means that individuals and companies now use to lower their taxable incomes For individuals it proposed limiting such deductions and exclusions as state and local taxes charitable contributions employerpaid fringe benefits and capital gains For corporations it proposed doing away with the investment tax credit the rapid depreciation system adopted in 1981 and other special preferences All told corporate taxes would be increased by more than a third individual taxes cut by about 8 percent Ambitious as it was the Treasurys plan is hardly a novel one Tax scholars have written countless treatises urging that such principles be adopted And two legislative teams  Senator Bradley and Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri for the Democrats and Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin and Representative Jack F Kemp for the Republicans  have offered proposals similar to the Treasurys But before the Treasurys plan was presented the propects of tax overhaul under President Reagan seemed little brighter than the prospects of nuclear disarmament Why the skeptics asked would Ronald Reagan turn his back on the business interests and wealthy contributors who helped elect him and who have learned to manipulate the present tax law to their considerable advantage As the weeks went by however the answer to the skeptics question became clearer The public perceives the current tax system as unfair It may be good politics to change it One of Mr Reagans top advisers put it this way There is nothing he would like better than to get into a battle where he and the people are on one side of the issue and the special interests are on the other An experienced Senate political aide said Can you imagine if the Great Communicator goes on television and says How many of you people benefit from accelerated depreciation How many of you benefit from investment tax credits How many of you write off intangible drilling costs There isnt a Senator alive who can stand up to that kind of pressure
THE PARTISAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/magazine/the-partisan.html,WILLIAM HUBBS REHNQUIST THE 89th Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court sits in his ornate office within the marblehalled Court and ponders briefly whether he would consider himself a partisan In this sense I have written opinions and joined opinions that have said that the Fourth Amendment  should be construed in this way Ive written opinions and joined opinions that say the establishment clause of the Constitution should be construed in this way Now Ive thought those things through I think those opinions are right And I want to see that version of the law applied when the case comes up If that makes me a partisan certainly Im a partisan But I dont think that distinguishes me from most of my colleagues Yet on a Court that has lacked powerful personalities and a firm sense of direction Justice Rehnquist stands out For a decade the Courts majority had appeared unsympathetic to Justice Rehnquists entreaties from the right Recently a new more conservative majority has begun to emerge with the Justice at its ideological center The conservative bloc is composed of Justices Rehnquist and Sandra Day OConnor and Chief Justice Warren E Burger but two other Justices Byron R White and Lewis F Powell Jr considered moderates frequently provide the crucial fourth and fifth votes In a relatively short span of time their majority decisions have curbed civil liberties the authority of the Federal Government and the rights of accused criminals Justice Rehnquist has perhaps delivered more speeches than any of his brethren except for Chief Justice Burger and he has written more than his share of biting dissents But aside from a small interview for a recent ABCTV documentary on the Supreme Court for which unlike this article he was allowed to approve the answers Justice Rehnquist had never granted an interview in which he has talked about his own judicial philosophy and his tenure on the Court I just wanted a chance to put my two cents in he said explaining his decision to be interviewed for this article Justice Rehnquist spoke to me for nearly three hours in his office in two separate sessions and later by phone In breaking his silence he emerged by his statements as a Justice who is directed in his opinions not so much by stare decisis  past judicial decisions as by an inner compass that almost unfailingly evolved from a moral vision developed long ago In a wideranging discussion Justice Rehnquist talked about the Presidents prerogative to remake the Court and the Republican Party platform on the criteria for Court selections He described his relationship with his colleagues and taunted his critics within academia and the press Moreover Justice Rehnquist affirmed his viewpoint that the Courts role should be circumscribed Justice Rehnquists role as the Courts conservative conscience has taken on new importance during a term when the Court will decide at least 15 important First Amendment cases Also at issue among other things is the constitutionality of an Alabama law mandating a moment of silence in the public schools and a Connecticut law requiring that employees be given a day off for their sabbath Warren Court precedents could fall as they did last term when Justice Rehnquist wrote the 5to4 decision in New York v Quarles weakening the 1966 Miranda ruling by permitting a publicsafety exception to the rule that suspected criminals be read their rights before questioning This term Justice Rehnquist and the Courts increasingly conservative nature continue to have an impact Justice Rehnquist voted with the majority in a 6to3 decision in New Jersey v TLO holding that Fourth Amendment requirements for search warrants do not apply to searches of students by school officials His 7to2 opinion in Wainwright v Witt will make it easier for prosecutors to exclude from capital cases prospective jurors who oppose the death penalty However a recent important case upset his 1976 opinion upholding states rights in National League of Cities v Usery Justice Rehnquist who dissented with Justices Powell and OConnor and Chief Justice Burger stated he was confident the principle will in time again command the support of a majority of this Court Hes the one with the agenda asserts A E Dick Howard a law professor at the University of Virginia He has claim to the leadership role on the court Lawrence H Tribe a law professor at the Harvard Law School is more speculative As he moves closer to the center as the Court moves right his voice could become weaker against equally strong intellects he says On the other hand he could have an enormous impact particularly if he were elevated to Chief Justice That has happened rarely because it can cause terrible friction with the other Justices If as Justice Rehnquist insists he has not changed since he was appointed to the Court in 1971 then the new working majority appears to have moved more closely into line with a national mood embodying his views and those of President Reagan who likely will have a historic opportunity to shift the Court further right during the next four years Five of the Courts members  Justices Powell William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and Harry A Blackmun and Chief Justice Burger  are 76 and older If the President wanted to convert it into a thoroughbred conservative Court  its the same President appointing five people  he could certainly do that Justice Rehnquist observes dryly HIS THREE LAW CLERKS CALL HIM THE BOSS He is a bit heavier his hair thinner and grayer the brown eyeglasses thicker than when he first arrived The smile is quick and genuine and often followed by a wry comment or clever rejoinder He speaks slowly and with a hint of a stammer choosing his words carefully occasionally pausing 15 seconds or more to ponder a question before answering Though Justice Rehnquist granted these interviews he said he was doing so under duress His answers revealed much about his personality and philosophy but they were also reflective of a cagey lawyers literalism and shrewdness Replies were confined to the specific question information was seldom volunteered Sometimes he feinted with a plea that he simply didnt understand the question The Justice was particularly reticent about matters he considered personal  names of the judges he plays poker with details about his family Im not going to write your story for you he said Asked if he feels he had changed growing any in his 13 years on the Court Justice Rehnquist is characteristically precise You equate change with growth then he says I think in a sense there has been and maybe this is something that all members of collegiate courts go through but when I first came here I had a feeling that these were kind of very critical jurisprudential battles in many of these cases And you know I would get very kind of blue if I was in the minority a good deal and feel very pleased if I was in the majority I think I see it quite differently now from the perspective of 13 years That I used to think you know if there were an expression in a footnote in an opinion that I disagreed with that were going to be stuck with that footnote for years Well it turns out that any time five people decide that were not stuck with the footnote were not stuck with the footnote And things have a way of evolving on much more of a commonsense reaction to things than a strictly doctrinal approach where A follows from B from C I think I tend to view the process now as more of an institutional one that there probably are things to be said on both sides of issues that perhaps I didnt always think there were And a feeling that the institution has produced pretty well for 200 years and its undoubtedly going to survive very well without me or any of my colleagues in the future In his early years on the Court he often stood alone as a dissenter While the other Justices imposed their will Justice Rehnquist established himself as a counterweight to judicial activism If you think of a judicial conservative as one who generally inclines against broad interpretations of constitutional provisions I think I am a judicial conservative he explains Im a strong believer in pluralism says Justice Rehnquist when pressed to classify himself politically Dont concentrate all the power in one place And you know this is partly I think what the framers also conceived So it kind of is the line where political philosophy joins or at least borders judicial philosophy You dont want all the power in the Government as opposed to the people You dont want all the power in the Federal Government as opposed to the states Justice Rehnquist professes not to know the origins of his conservatism It may have something to do with my childhood he says sarcastically It is a defensive jibe at any who might comb his past seeking insight to the present The clues are there He and his sister Jean were raised in Shorewood Wis a peaceful upscale welltodo Milwaukee suburb In constrast to the mansions bordering Lake Michigan the William B Rehnquists lived in a modest tan brick house His father a firstgeneration American born of Swedish parents was a wholesale paper salesman who had not attended college His mother Margery a housewife and civic activist was proud of her University of Wisconsin degree and her fluency in five foreign language She earned money as a freelance translator for local companies Dinner in the Rehnquist household was a time for spirited political discussions and the children learned respect for the Republican views of Alf Landon and Wendell Willkie Herbert Hoover and Robert A Taft Young Bill became the feature editor of the allwhite Shorewood high school paper and soon used his new forum on the editorial page to make the trenchant observation that the recent windy weather may not have been due entirely to weather conditions Some of the selfstyled news interpreters have been doing a little too much spouting of their own There is no fault to be found with straight news broadcasts they perform a valuable public service But thorns to the commentators the overly dramatic Gabriel Heatter the pompous HV Kaltenborn and Walter Winchell with his corps of tattlers World War II loomed large  Pearl Harbor had just been bombed  and so young Rehnquist volunteered to be a civildefense officer in his neighborhood and was given responsibility for a network of block captains who were to report to the local police chief any crimes draft dodging or according to his school paper subversive activities which might lead to the sabotaging of our national unity He was all of 17 Later he won a scholarship to Kenyon College in Ohio but attended for just one year before joining the Army air corps as a weather observer in 1943 Hostilities had ended by the time he was sent to the North African stations of Cairo Tunis Tripoli and Casablanca When he returned from Africa he knew he didnt want to suffer through any more frigid winters I wanted to find someplace like North Africa to go to school he recalls He used his GI Bill benefits to attend Stanford in Palo Alto Calif and when they ended he ran the breakfast program in the university dining hall I had so many other parttime jobs I cant remember them all He majored in political science and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1948 In the next two years he received masters degrees from Stanford and Harvard in political science returning to Stanford for his law degree and graduating first in his class in 1952 Such impressive credentials earned him a Supreme Court clerkship with Associate Justice Robert H Jackson a conservative How do you get your views he muses I dont think anybody has any idea Obviously there was a long part of my life when I was in high school and in the Army that I just simply didnt give any thought to those things But I can remember arguments we would get in as law clerks in the early 50s And I dont know that my views have changed much from that time During his 18month clerkship the Court which had legitimized separate but equal public education for black children with Plessy v Ferguson in 1896 confronted anew the issue of racial segregation The 28yearold clerk wrote a memo to Justice Jackson in 1952 declaring that separate but equal schools for whites and blacks still legal then were right and should be affirmed He wrote To the argument made by Thurgood not John Marshall that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minority are In 1954 with the landmark Brown v Board of Education decision the Court would rule that segregated public schools were unconstitutional Years later when that memo was made public shortly before the 68to26 Senate vote on his confirmation to the Court Justice Rehnquist then head of the Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department under President Nixon maintained that the views were Justice Jacksons not his own New evidence discovered by Justice Jacksons biographer Prof Dennis J Hutchinson of the University of Chicago appears to contradict that explanation Professor Hutchinson after inspecting all of the Justices papers from the Court  every box every detail  says he found no other instance during Justice Jacksons 13 years on the Court when as Mr Rehnquist the Court nominee insisted happened he asked a law clerk to prepare a memo for conference discussion summarizing the Justices views An absurd explanation Professor Hutchinson concludes Professor Hutchinson also discovered two additional Rehnquist memos on race relations In one the law clerk endorses as being right to a lawyer rather than a crusader an appealscourt ruling in Terry v Adams that effectively denied blacks the right to vote in a Texas Democratic club election that had determined every countywide race since 1889 The issue was whether the club was purposefully designed to exclude blacks from voting registered white voters were automatically members In the other memo written after the Court had agreed to hear Terry v Adams Mr Rehnquist told Justice Jackson The Constitution does not prevent the majority from banding together nor does it attaint success in the effort It is about time the Court faced the fact that the white people in the South dont like the colored people the Constitution restrains them from effecting this dislike through state action but it most assuredly did not appoint the Court as a sociological watchdog to rear up every time private discrimination raises its admittedly ugly head To the extent that this decision advances the frontier of state action and social gain it pushes back the frontier of freedom of association and majority rule Liberals should be the first to realize after the past 20 years that it does not do to push blindly through towards one constitutional goal without paying attention to other equally desirable values that are being trampled on in the process Justice Jackson rejected that argument and joined seven other Justices in finding that blacks had been unconstitutionally denied voting rights in 1954 he also joined the Brown ruling Asked if his views on Brown have changed since that time Justice Rehnquist replies I think they probably have He says he now accept Brown as the law of the land yet he still maintains I think there was a perfectly reasonable argument the other way As to the memos discovered by Professor Hutchinson he demurs refusing to say whether he agrees today with what he wrote then Whatever I wrote for Justice Jackson was obviously a long time ago and to kind of integrate it into something Im telling you now I find rather difficult AFTER HIS CLERKSHIP William Rehnquist set up a law practice in Phoenix On his way west from Washington he stopped in Fort Smith Ark to examine old court records and newspaper clippings on an apparently favorite historical figure Isaac C Parker the notorious hanging judge who meted out 164 death sentences as a Federal judge in the Western District of Arkansas from 1875 until 1896 For 15 of those years until an Act of Congress in 1891 no right of appeal was authorized I gathered some fascinating minutiae with a view to eventually writing a biography recalled Justice Rehnquist in a speech two years ago at the University of Arkansas Judge Parkers trials were swift and there was no appeal but the fundamentals of due process were undoubtedly present He has high praise for the English practice of allowing few appeals from trialcourt judgments in criminal cases and of punishing those whose appeals are later deemed frivolous Due process is important he says but societys moral judgments of its members must also be vindicated He chafes at the delays in executions caused by what he views as excessive appeals Last year he made the bold suggestion that the automatic right of appeal be ended in Federal civil cases As a lawyer in Phoenix he continued his conservative activism In 1964 he opposed a local publicaccommodations law You are talking about a mans private property he stated testifying as a private citizen and in 1967 an integration plan for the Phoenix public schools He became friendly with another politically active Arizonan Richard G Kleindienst and when President Nixon appointed Mr Kleindienst Deputy Attorney General Mr Rehnquist was hired as head of the Office of Legal Counsel The future Justice screened the Presidents Supreme Court nominees  including Justices Burger and Blackmun as well as Clement F Haynsworth and G Harrold Carswell who were rejected amid some notoriety In 1971 he himself was nominated I came to the court sensing without really having followed it terribly closely that there were some excesses in terms of constitutional adjudication during the era of the socalled Warren Court Justice Rehnquist says And I felt that I probably would disagree with some of those decisions I was in private practice I didnt pay a lot of attention to these things But the couple of cases I did pay some attention to seemed to me to be hard to justify in terms of constitutional adjudication So I felt that at the time I came on the Court the boat was kind of heeling over in one direction Interpreting my oath as I saw it I felt that my job was where those sort of situations arose to kind of lean the other way The result in those early years was a plethora of acerbic oneman dissents  in cases where he opposed school desegregation womens rights civilservice jobs for aliens and health care for the poor among other issues So frequently was he the only dissenter among the nine Justices that his law clerks in 1974 presented him with a small Lone Ranger doll that a decade later remains proudly on the mantel above his office fireplace They referred to me as the lone dissenter  he chuckles Even in lone dissent observes Professor Tribe of Harvard he has helped to define a new range of what is possible An example of that occurred in Justice Rehnquists 1976 National League of Cities case generally considered to be the highwater mark of his efforts to judicially limit Federal power over the states However the decision was overturned last month with the 5to4 Garcia v San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority ruling effectively enhancing Federal power over the states The issue in National League of Cities was whether the Federal minimumwage law applied to all His many critics in academia often accuse Justice Rehnquist of being disingenuous in his opinion writing Indeed in more than a few instances Justice Rehnquist has buttressed an opinion or a dissent with his own perception of the Constitutions tacit postulates or with a version of history too well known to warrant more than brief mention If I thought it well founded in the sense that I do things in a more disingenuous way than other appellate judges In a dissenting opinion thats really the purpose of a dissent to lay the seeds for hopefully a change of doctrine To Justices Rehnquists mind The suggestion that I am disingenuous in going about the process of adjudication could be made equally well about my colleague Bill Brennan But I think theres a great deal more sympathy in the lawschool faculties for the results he reaches than for the results I reach On occasion they write somewhat disingenuously about me As I recall there was a poll taken of lawschool faculty members in the 1972 election And 85 percent of them were going to vote for George McGovern in an election in which he carried one state You have to say that based on the law of averages the author is going to start with something of a predisposition against a lot of my ideas Because I do think that the political carries over some to the judicial philosophy IF JUSTICE REHNQUIST seems far less shrill in his writing today it is because he has been finding himself far more frequently in the majority In part it is because Justice OConnor President Reagans first appointee to the Court and an old friend and Stanford lawschool classmate of Justice Rehnquist quickly became a reliable third vote for the conservative bloc Justice White a Kennedy appointee now joins the right often enough to be a predictable fourth comments Professor Howard of Virgina When you have four solid votes its fairly easy to pick up the fifth and Justice Powell often provides that crucial vote Of 28 cases decided last term by a vote of 5 to 4 Justices Powell and White and the three conservative Justices comprised the majority on nine occasions Justice Rehnquist was in the majority in 17 of the 28 of those close cases joined by Chief Justice Burger in all but one of them and by Justice OConnor in all but two In Justice Rehnquists view the Court now may be Although his critics argue that he is a judicial activist but with a conservative agenda Justice Rehnquist says his legacy to the Court is a sense of judicial restraint for want of a better word Were carrying out a constitutional function that is a very delicate one Every time we say that a law of Congress is unconstitutional that a state law is unconstitutional we are overriding a democratically reached decision Now the Constitution requires us to do that but it requires us to do it only with great caution and circumspection Because the Supreme Court is so thoroughly undemocratic  says Justice Rehnquist he believes its role should be circumscribed In a view as much idealistic as partisan he says that al At a later point he returned to this philosophy Who was it Oliver Goldsmith who said How small of all the ills that human hearts endure that part that laws or kings can cause or cure I think thats just very very true Comparing the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Burger with Chief Justice Warrens Court Justice Rehnquist believes its impact today has been diminished I dont think that the Burger Court has as wide a sense of mission Perhaps it doesnt have any sense of mission at all In the area of constitutional rights of accused criminal defendants the Court has called a halt to a number of the sweeping rulings that were made in the days of the Warren Court I dont know if you can describe that as a sense of mission or not Some of the religion clause decisions and some of the equalprotection clause decisions of the Warren Court went quite far and I think that the Burger Court really comes up with mixed results in that area I dont know that a court should really have a sense of mission I think the sense of mission comes best from the President or the House of Representatives or the Senate Theyre supposed to be the motive force in our Government The Supreme Court and the Federal judiciary are more the brakes that say Youre trying to do this but you cant do it that way The idea that the Court should be way out in front saying Look this is the way the country ought to go I dont think that was ever the purpose of the Court Decisions like Brown Miranda and Roe v Wade legalizing abortion by upholding a womans right to privacy Justice Rehnquist says are exceptions that simply prove the rule The judicial litmus test embodied in the 1984 Republican Party platform is a response to the activism Justice Rehnquist claims to eschew The platform assails the elitist and unresponsive Federal judiciary and establishes a moral imperative for new Federal judges They must support traditional family values and oppose abortion If the President thinks that an appointee ought to have particular views I think thats the Presidents prerogative Justice Rehnquist says You know the Presidents whove tried to appoint people with a particular point of view  people like Lincoln  who made five appointments  or Franklin Roosevelt  who made nine  have often only been partly successful because the judge is apt to sit long beyond the tenure of the President and to be deciding questions that really were never even thought of at the time he was appointed Justice Rehnquist an American history buff has studied past Presidential attempts to pack the Supreme Court Just three weeks before President Reagans reelection Justice Rehnquist spoke at the University of Minnesota Law School downplaying the success any President can have in remaking the Court When a justice puts on the robe he contended he puts aside partisanship The theme nothing new for him had surfaced in a speech nine years earlier Yet there was more than a little irony in Justice Rehnquists preelection timing of his speech and he inadvertently made the point he was trying to disprove Even 13 years after his appointment a Supreme Court Justice explicitly chosen for his doctrinaire conservatism was still a partisan still sensitive to the political fray Contrary to what he said on the eve of the election the President can strongly influence the direction of the Court and the appointment of Justice Rehnquist is in itself an example of that Professor Tribe observes According to Professor Howard of Virginia Justice Rehnquists thesis that Presidents are often disappointed in their nominees loses its validity in the contemporary context Eisenhower was disappointed with Earl Warren and White certainly bears little ideological similarity to Kennedy Professor Tribe says But since the nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice Congress and the White House have been much more sensitive to the ideology of a nominee Were moving from a period where politics is no longer the name of the game and ideology is whats important in a judicial nominee Were seeing this in the people that are mentioned most frequently as candidates for the next Supreme Court vacancy Robert H Bork and Antonin Scalia  judges on the United States Court of Appeals in Washington  and Richard A Posner  a judge on the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago They arent politicians whose views might change when they put on the robe They are people who already have very welldefined ideologies All three judges are former law school professors Judge Bork taught at Yale Judges Scalia and Posner at the University of Chicago who are forceful advocates of judicial restraint and laissezfaire government All were given appealscourt judgeships by President Reagan so he could have one last look asserts Yale Kamisar a professor at the University of Michigan law school They would be much less unpredictable than Supreme Court nominees historically have been Theyre established conservative voices whove already demonstrated as lower court judges how theyll decide certain cases Justice Rehnquist says he sees virtue in diversity and would be loath to have eight colleagues who marched in lock step with him Anything like a oneman or I suppose in this day a oneperson Supreme Court would be an incredibly tyrannical thing he remarks Obviously I dont have any clones around As Bill Douglas used to say The person I want appointed is someone who thinks just like me You dont want eight of those people appointed but like all of my colleagues I would welcome two or three If there were two or three people like me  Ive been in dissent in a number of cases  perhaps some of those dissents would then become court opinions Thats a very iffy business though Despite the likelihood of substantial turnover on the Court Justice Rehnquist says he gives little thought to the prospect for change My nature is I live one day at a time and dont look far into the future I just kind of wrestle with whats at the front door now and dont worry a lot about whats going to show up tomorrow To live in the present means theres literally no time for thinking about past decisions Was I right or was I wrong Youd simply go nuts if you did that No opinion he has written stands out to him as being particularly noteworthy or memorable  theyre all kind of a long gray line JUSTICE REHNQUIST IS A quick worker who shuns the customary long bench memos from his clerks in favor of short brisk walks where cases can be discussed and issues pinpointed and he demands the same measure of alacrity from his clerks first drafts of opinions must be completed in 10 days He likes to get his work done and get home explains a former clerk Ronald L Blunt now counselor to the Attorney General The Justice drives a blue Volkswagen Rabbit to the Court from his Arlington Va town house a large home in suburban McLean was recently sold arriving by 9 AM and leaving most days by 3 PM For work he prefers splitleather desert boots casual slacks and a tweed sport coat to more formal attire He smokes an occasional lowtar cigarette He is a trivia buff who often matches wits with other Justices by passing questions through the interoffice mail In 1983 Justice Rehnquist laying claim to his reputation as the Courts resident practical joker decided to tweak his brethren by circulating a mock attack on a lone dissent prepared by Justice Marshall Already alerted by Justice Rehnquist to the joke Justice Marshall played along feigning displeasure When the Rehnquist memo hit the other chambers the first reaction was puzzlement then anger among some clerks when Justice Rehnquists minions assured them The Boss was indeed serious about publishing his criticism of Justice Marshall in the official United States Reports the bound volume of Court decisions From the clerks of Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun came word that their superiors were discussing ways to head him off Justice Rehnquist decided the joke had gone far enough and he circulated a Dear Thurgood letter The occasion for his magnanimity in withdrawing his statement he wrote with mock seriousness was an obscure Swedish holiday that he a SwedishAmerican celebrated each year by doing a good deed In his office surrounded with portraits of Justices Jackson John Marshall Oliver Wendell Holmes and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and a photograph of his former boss in the Nixon Administration Attorney General John N Mitchell Justice Rehnquist recalls his first impression of the Court I can remember the day I moved over here from the Justice Department I think it was three or four days before Christmas in 1971 And I brought my secretary and one of my special assistants from Justice who was going to be a law clerk We came over here and it was kind of a gray afternoon and everyone had left for Christmas And I just felt literally like Id entered a monastery when I came over There was nobody around these long corridors and there was some sort of an energy crisis and only a couple of lights were on Everybody who comes here probably feels the constraints of the place he says I think the Court is remote I have my own ways of trying to get away from the monasticism Im sure my colleagues have theirs The ways probably arent adequate I visit law schools and make speeches and go to classes and have question andanswer sessions I will occasionally give a speech to a bar association I take a painting class at night school where I mix with lots of people who are totally different from the kind of people I mix with regularly And Im thinking about maybe writing a book about the Court You just have to keep anchors to the outside world because a Justice of this Court could do all of the work he has to do in discharge of his oath of office without ever having to leave this building The chambers are here the courtroom is here the library is here the cafeteria is here Theres a gym and an exercise room And you know its just a twodimensional world if you let that happen to you Last year he traveled unannounced to Richmond Va to preside over a twoday trial  the first time in this century that a sitting Justice had done so To refresh myself he explains The case had been filed by two police officers who claimed their rights were violated when they were suspended from the force following their testimony about alleged police brutality A sixperson jury awarded the two damages totaling 26500 It reinforced my perspective that I had a little bit from my days as a trial lawyer Justice Rehnquist says and that was the very threedimensional world in which trial lawyers and trial judges live When Justice Rehnquist arrived at the Court Justice William O Douglas encouraged him to maintain an active life outside the Court Ideologically the two men were at polar extremes Douglas the iconoclastic liberal Rehnquist the unreconstructed conservative Yet each in his own way exemplified the Western ethic of rugged individualism and there was a personal bond during their time together on the Court  from Justice Rehnquists swearing in on Jan 7 1972 until Justice Douglass retirement on Nov 12 1975 Justice Douglas died in 1980 I would be flattered in many respects if I thought there was a comparison because I think Justice Douglas was a remarkably able and interesting person he says Maybe its just my own image of myself but I think of Justice Douglas in his last 10 perhaps 15 years here as being very much of an iconoclast You know really not caring a great deal whether anybody else agreed with him or not In fact sometimes we used to say at conference that we thought he was disappointed if he was in the majority because then he would have to write something that he would have to get other peoples agreement with whereas if he were all by himself he could say exactly what he wanted I dont think of myself as being that way I still think that ones major contribution comes by putting something together yourself or joining something someone else puts together that commands a court opinion Justice Douglas was 40 when President Roosevelt appointed him in 1939 Justice Rehnquist was 47 when he came to the Court Bill mentioned to me that when he looked at Rehnquist he saw himself recalls Cathleen Douglas Stone the widow of Justice Douglas and now a Boston lawyer He felt very sympathetic to Rehnquist encouraged him to take up hobbies and spent a lot of time with him giving him the observation of Bills own life and what it was like being a young man on the Supreme Court When you come to the Supreme Court the door closes That has a different impact on a young man as opposed to say a man of 65 Bill said You can become a dry husk of a man  It suits me better at age 60 than it did at 47 Justice Rehnquist says of the Court At age 60 the life tenure looks good and I know that if I were a senior partner in a law firm with a nice corner office and views out both windows a bunch of young people would be walking by wondering when I was going to go on semiretired status so they could have the office He spoke of the possibility of retirement at 65 I would love to get a new job when I am age 65 and could retire says Justice Rehnquist who earns 100600 a year and whose net worth is less than 150000 aside from real estate But those things just dont come along very often I dont have any very good prospects except for staying here until I retire and then problably doing a little judging and a little teaching or something like that The Justices interests include oil painting stamp collecting vacationing occasionally with his three grown children and their spouses at his second home in Greensboro Vt and reading aloud with his wife Natalie Weve covered probably 20 books in the last year and a half or so were just finishing up William Dean Howellss The Rise of Silas Lapham  Once a week he plays tennis with his law clerks He once had to give up the game several years ago because of a back problem that only became known to the outside world when he was hospitalized after becoming addicted to the powerful painkilling drug Placidyl Although his back still bothers him  during our interview the condition prevented him from moving a coffee table  he will discuss neither that episode nor the present state of his health except to testily say Im perfectly satisfied I can do my job I suppose lots of unhealthy people are also perfectly satisfied they can do their jobs But Im going to stick by what I said He also allows that he was bothered a little bit by the publicity that attended his illness the descriptions of his slurred speech on the bench the awkward slowness with which he sometimes spoke But if youre bothered by what the press says about you youre just not cut out for this job Of the newspaper editorials that have been critical of him Justice Rehnquist observes Theyve bought the newspapers Theyre entitled to express their views He adds a pungent coda about The New York Times and The Washington Post They have a particular point of view If they want to be a house organ for the ACLU thats their privilege What qualities should a Supreme Court Justice possess  what should a President look for I think you have to be interested in the law as kind of a discipline Justice Rehnquist says I think you can be a successful lawyer without having any great interest in the law Im not sure that you could be a successful appellate judge without having an interest in the law I think you also have to enjoy writing And you have to enjoy analyzing things But over and above that you have to be able to stand on your own two feet I think it was Cicero who said about someone He saw life cleary and he saw it whole And you have to have a little bit of that in you Not being bamboozled by currents trendy ideas that sort of thing    It just captures something Not easily conned Not awash in current trends of public opinion
STAGE VIEW;   THIS 'INTERLUDE' GETS A STRANGE RESPONSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/theater/stage-view-this-interlude-gets-a-strange-response.html,I find everything about the imported British revival of Eugene ONeills Strange Interlude astonishing except the fact that the play is just as earnestly foolish as it seemed to be when it was done here by the Actors Studio in 1963 When I say astonishing I dont necessarily mean astonishingly good though in a few instances it is that Neither do I mean astonishingly bad I mean that I find the extremely peculiar effect the production has on stage together with the extremely peculiar response the audience offers it astonishing More than that Its unthinkable We must be orderly about this The most original decision director Keith Hack has taken and far and away the most successful is that of unfreezing his actors You may recall  if youve ever seen the play you will recall  the device ONeill employed in conveying the unspoken thoughts of his less than trustworthy characters When they spoke to one another they spoke to one another  as in most plays But when they spoke their inner secrets aloud they tended to face front adopt a faintly sepulchral tone and enunciate the speeches without commas or inflections meanwhile around them the company turned to stone It was a stopandstart business and unless the play had been cast with David Garrick Richard Burbage Edmund Kean and Peg Woffington the audience was in for a bad five hours possibly without dinner I am told that Lynn Fontanne who first played Nina Leeds could have taught Peg Woffington a thing or two Clearly director Hack has asked himself Why all this And discovered that he was stuck for an answer There is no why  no need And so gone are the heads that twitched front or away like so many railroad signals gone the undersea descents in private bathyspheres Everyone speaks freely rapidly and on cue  as though people were turning corners simultaneously busy with their emotional shopping We understand from context that some of the nastier accusations werent meant to be heard But you know what The person being accused isnt listening anyway Its all really very safe People dont listen half the time Too busy thinking their own thoughts mumbling them aloud as like as not and not getting arrested for it either The ego turns out to be a great big switchboard and its got so many plugs going in and out at once that attention becomes highly selective It would seem that Mr Hack has stumbled not only on a happy formal device but on the truth proper The convergence of thoughts words phrases expletives at a rapid rate also has an oddly poetic ring to it and this after all the time and anguish ONeill spent trying for a formal poetry But it is just this coming together of the apparently irrelevant that makes for poetic imagery and there you are Or rather here ONeill is sounding linguistically richer than usual during the evenings first two scenes Eventually and less happily we discover another aspect of the private thoughts or asides They arent really necessary ninetenths of the time and they arent fundamentally dramatic either Lets say that red headed Glenda Jackson playing that Nina Leeds who has lost her true love to World War I and has since spent her days  and quite a few of her nights  in making the men in her orbit pay for it is preparing to tell a damaging secret to someone wholl be destroyed by it She informs us in soliloquy of what she is about to do She then either does it or tries to do it and is deflected But you see if we are actually going to watch the attempt being made we dont need the preparatory announcement The action conveys its own clear message even when the impulses behind it are fairly complex In effect we are getting the same information twice And this alas robs the second line  the key line  of its impact By overexplaining ONeill has taken away some of his plays necessary mystery For once we know too much Nonetheless to give director Hack and his company its due the device is inventively handled The second of my astonishments is the number of perfectly legitimate laughs that bubble up and explode during the evenings earlier sequences Actor Edward Petherbridge either has been given the duty of getting the merriment rolling quickly or has been inspired to do it on his own because he is having such fun but he has managed to turn Miss Jacksons eternally patient eternally loving eternally sexless suitor the novelist Charles Marsden Good Old Charlie into a wonderfully fussed and fidgety commentator on the sex yahoos among whom he must live Most of the Charlies Ive seen have been damp with selfpity Mr Petherbridge is more nearly enraged and it is his high dudgeon that sets the tone for the constant crackle of comedy that helps the opening sequences to get their plotting done easily While we are learning about Ninas nervous breakdown about her refusal to live with her father about her need to atone for her failure to sleep with her idolized fiance before his death we are also watching Charlie figureskate on the library rug a wasp on the wing wondering just whom to attack next Mr Petherbridge never cheats for a laugh everything is honest He has simply imagined a man whose nerveends would surely behave in this way And those nerveends fray too Attend to him digging his hands deep into his pockets as though somewhere in those depths he might find a quarter or a nickel to add to the very small change that constitutes his life With ONeills third scene of nine the evenings real troubles begin Remembering the play we knew it was bound to happen Though she doesnt in the least love the man Nina has been persuaded to marry Sam Evans  once her fiances schoolmate  and to give him a baby She is newly pregnant when she makes her first visit to Sams home where Sams whitehaired mother is ready and waiting grimlipped with The News Suddenly we sense the imminence of contrived melodrama and for a few moments suppress our titters But even the language has lost its confident sophistication and dropped to this Its the curse of the Evanses My husbands mother  she was an only child  died in an asylum and her father before her I know that for a fact And my husbands sister Sammys aunt shes out of her mind She lives on the top floor of this house hasnt been out of her room in years     Theres no way back now The audience has laughed openly at a seriously intended speech Furthermore the speech is a key to all of the narrative that is to follow The insanity in the family motif will dog us forever after and whenever it does there will be a wave of laughter to greet it The play explains and explains Sam knew nothing of the curse on the household Nina must now arrange an abortion Nina must also find another man to impregnate her so that she can pass off the second baby as Sams child Turning to an obvious leadingman type who seems to have been standing in line biding his time for just such use Nina makes him the proposition Brian Cox who overplays the part of this family friend who is also a physician is profoundly shocked In due time however he accepts In due time a baby is born Sam thinks it is his The audience thinks it is funny And there is something irresistibly funny about the spectacle of the rugged Mr Cox having to be dragged off to the nonnuptial couch by a siren who is determined to have her way with him We do know that Mr Cox has ventured to kiss Miss Jackson once Ill never forget that kiss he says But he is a man of great principle many scruples and a scientific bent of mind that makes him want to observe rather than participate He stops right in the middle of their debate over the proposition to observe his wrist watch and note that his blood pressure has risen Fortunately it has risen rather more than he realized and he winds up ablaze with passion kneeling at her feet The plot can go on But with this scene the audience response has entered a new and to me unrecognizable phase True the outline of this particular theatrical situation has always been regarded as comic  a man trying to fight off the sex he actually craves  while ONeill has written it straight as drama The audience however has reverted to its usual delight with the poor fellows dilemma and chosen to howl with glee We are now inside a new kind of laughter a very complicated one The audience isnt just laughing at the wry valid humors that Mr Petherbridge has found in ONeills text Neither is it laughing the impolite horselaugh that has greeted the creaking plot machinery involving hereditary insanity Nor can it be said to be laughing exclusively at the reluctantmalevirgin antics that underlie the proposal and its slightly delayed acceptance In some odd way the audience has decided to laugh at all three equally as though the evenings effects were all equal and equally funny in the same way It has concluded that Strange Interlude is comedy through and through and a kind of selfparodying broad comedy at that Would I be guessing correctly if I suggested that in order to protect the pleasure it has taken in the plays opening scenes it has decided to pretend that opening scenes and middle scenes and closing scenes are all of a piece cut from the same cloth Ive got to believe that the audience has made some such decision in order to understand the continued merriment that greets the demise of one of the principal characters The principals are gathered on a Long Island terrace during a regatta pennants flying Sam still Ninas husband seems in the bloom of health though there is a reference along the way to his high blood pressure Sizable laugh from out front There is a second cautionary reference to that same dangerous condition Much bigger laugh At the height of the days excitement Sam suddenly loses control of his movements lurches wildly tumbles to the deck with a stroke Sam mind you is a sympathetic character and James Hazeldine who plays him handles the physical aspects of the seizure very plausibly indeed But judging by the hilarity that greeted Sams fall the company might just as well have been playing the soapsuds scene from Mr Roberts at one time clocked as the longest laugh on Broadway How far will an audience go to make sure that it hangs onto its fun Had director Hack and his actors while performing the piece in London played into what are normally called unwanted laughs If you cant beat ONeills melodrama had you best join it I only know that I have never seen never heard the like Miss Jacksons 1920s high Dutch bob really bobs under emotional stress and she has turned up some very choice readings One of my favorites is an eerie Im not sick father Im too well The double o in her too would empty a forest of owls on the spot Id say For her line Life is just a long drawn out lie she inhales so intensely that she seems to steal some of our breath too at the same time she clutches a doorframe that will keep her if not the rest of the world upright The actress however may possess too shrewd an eye and too matterof fact a mind to create the hypnotic demand that will bind every male on the premises tightly to her Though Tom Aldredge has no more than a single scene as her father he is particularly fine in the part several local actors have joined the mainly

On Making Childbirth Preferable to Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/04/opinion/l-on-making-childbirth-preferable-to-abortion-064376.html,To the Editor Abortions do not occur because any person seeks or welcomes them They involve a surgical procedure with some risk to the patient and the possibility of psychological complications Why then do so many abortions occur Surely no one is so naive as to think they occur in such numbers because our society has made them legal The causes are obviously deeper Those who remember the period in our social history before legalization can recall the prevalence of a phenomenon then popularly known as the shotgun marriage This phenomenon however afflicted only a small percentage of the population  mostly teenagers still living under the authority of their parents and typically middleclass The poor and the rich were immune  the rich by virtue of the availability of abortion the poor because of the insignificance attached to the middleclass stigma of illegitimacy Married women in the period of illegal abortion may have been deterred to some extent by the cost of abortion This however was probably less important than the nature of marriage and family when a housewifes chief role was generally considered to be child rearing and relatively little thought was given to the dangers of overpopulation Obviously the legalization of abortion is tied in part to the changing roles of women and families Indeed if I can be forgiven for attributing subconscious motivations I suspect that many of the vocal opponents of legalized abortion see turning back the clock in that domain as a way of restoring more traditional patterns of marriage family and womens roles That is not to suggest limits on the ability of such opponents to reduce these matters to a single clearcut moral issue that abortion is the murder of a human being So long as that is how these people perceive these matters they are I agree duty bound to oppose abortion with all their might What I mean to suggest however is that the chief efforts of their moral zeal the effort to recriminalize abortion is unlikely to advance their cause and could indeed be counterproductive in the way alcoholic prohibition became a stimulus to organized crime Recriminalizing abortion is after all not likely to get women back into the home nor to make large families more attractive It would undoubtedly make abortion more expensive and in some sense may make outlaws of those who perform them Recriminalizing abortion would probably also increase illegitimacy among the poor It seems to me a far more productive way to oppose abortion would be to make childbirth more attractive for those who resort to abortion as the lesser of two evils The money being wasted to produce yet another 100 signs that read abortion is murder believe me we have all gotten the message or in the worst case to build more devastating bombs should be funneled into clinics for the care and support of pregnant women and for efforts to reduce the stigma of giving birth out of wedlock More effort could also be given to family planning that does not include the option of abortion In such an effort serious attention should be given to greater equality for women If it is true as some abortion opponents appear to believe that there is too much sex and not enough love going on that can only be because of the vestiges of male domination and intimidation in our society Women cannot engage effectively in family planning so long as they are beholden to men for their status in society The persistence of prostitution is evidence that many men have traditionally sought sex without responsibility Men have also traditionally presented women the option of being whore or saint to win male approval Those options are both demeaning to women It seems to me that efforts to recriminalize abortion have no goals beyond those bankrupt alternatives for women I urge the opponents of abortion to rethink their methods and their goals The old ways left much to be desired The effort to reinstitute them can only lead to a resistance that will further erode respect for law CLINTON COLLINS Lexington Ky Feb 22 1985

SHOT FIRED THROUGH WINDOW OF BLACKMUN HOME,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/05/nyregion/shot-fired-through-window-of-blackmun-home.html,Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun of the Supreme Court said today that someone fired a shot into his apartment last Thursday night and Federal investigators said they had recovered a bullet from a chair No one was injured The Federal Bureau of Investigation said the shot shattered a window of the Blackmuns thirdfloor apartment in Arlington Va just before 11 PM Thursday The agency said the bullet recovered was from a 9millimeter weapon and could have been fired from either a rifle or a pistol The Justice and his wife Dorothy were at home at the time of the incident the authorities said The 12story building in which they live is surrounded by other highrise buildings Justice Blackmun who is 76 years old started receiving threats after he wrote the Courts majority opinion on abortions in 1973 The Court ruled 7 to 2 that women have a constitutional right to abortions in the first six months of pregnancy Protests against that decision by various elements of the antiabortion movement have ranged from peaceful marches before the Supreme Court building to bombings at abortion clinics Lawenforcement officers said today that they had found no link between the shooting incident and written threats Justice Blackmun has received United Press International reported today that last week a typewritten letter said that the sender would kill Justice Blackmun and laugh at his funeral The news service also reported that he had received another written threat last October signed by the Army of God an antiabortion group that has claimed responsibility for several bombings In a 1982 television interview Justice Blackmun said he had been called butcher of Dachau murderer Pontius Pilate King Herod  you name it A brief FBI statement today said only that the bureau is conducting an investigation into threatening letters that have been received by Justice Blackmun Statement From the Court The shooting incident did not become public knowledge earlier because of what the Arlington County police said was a broad FBI holddown on information about the incident for four days The Supreme Court issued a brief statement today after a query about the shooting incident was made by UPI a Court spokesman said The statement said A shot went through the window of the Blackmum home last Thursday evening February 28 No one was injured The matter is under investigation An agent in the FBIs Washington field office Manuel Marquez said We acknowledge that we are conducting a joint investigation with the Arlington police department into the penetration by a bullet of a window in the residence of Justice Blackmun on February 28 Information Will Be Limited Lieut Robert Minnich of the Arlington County Police department said The FBI which was at the scene immediately after the incident has taken over the investigation because the Justice notified the Supreme Court police who notified the FBI The FBI has prime jurisdiction and the FBI has said that information will be limited Lane Bonner an FBI spokesman declined to say whether there was a suspect UPI reported but said that if one was arrested he would be charged with assaulting a Supreme Court Justice He said the penalty on that charge is imprisonment for up to 10 years and a 10000 fine Toni House the Supreme Court press officer said that historically at least not to my knowledge no member of the court had been shot at before In 1982 an opponent of pornography and school busing Newton C Estes was sentenced to 10 days in jail and a 500 fine for punching Associate Justice Byron R White in the face at a Utah Bar Association luncheon in Salt Lake City Justice White was not seriously injured and joked about the incident Miss House said today that she could not confirm United Press International reports that Justice Blackmun had just left the room when the bullet penetrated the window or that his wife had been showered by flying glass Neither Miss House nor Mr Marquez would comment on the news services report that security for Justice Blackmun originally assigned when threats against him intensified last fall had been increased since the shooting
SECOND JUSTICE GETS A DEATH THREAT BY MAIL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/06/us/second-justice-gets-a-death-threat-by-mail.html,The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating identical death threats mailed to Supreme Court Justice Harry A Blackmun Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York and another Supreme Court Justice the FBI said today Bill Baker a spokesman for the agency declined to name the other High Court justice who received the threatening mail but he said the FBI was attempting to determine if there was any connection between the letters and a gunshot fired into the home of Justice Blackmun in Arlington Va Thursday night No one was injured in the incident At this point we have turned up no links at all between the shooting incident and the letters and we are skeptical that a link exists Mr Baker said He noted that the agency was also considering the possibility that the shot fired into Mr Blackmuns apartment was accidental Were trying to determine if the shooting was an accident he said No one has claimed responsibility for it and we have no reason to think they will Mr DAmato made public today the letter he received It had a New York postmark and arrived at his Washington office Thursday The second Justice who received an identical letter was Justice Lewis F Powell Jr according to United Press International In Buffalo NY Michael Kogut an FBI agent said lawenforcement officials there turned up a number of threatening letters sent to local political officials as well as to Justice Blackmun Justice Powell and Mr DAmato From what we can tell all the letters have the same wording theyre identical Mr Kogut told United Press Mr Kogut told the news service that the letters all bore Buffalo postmarks and different return addresses in Buffalo They were general in nature but very specific as threats Mr Kogut was quoted as saying The letter writer expressed a general dissatisfaction and followed it up with a specific threat Actually a death threat He said that FBI agents interviewed people at the return addresses found on the letters and that we were pretty well assured the people had not mailed the letters Justice Blackmun 76 years old the author of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion confirmed Monday that a shot had been fired through a window of his thirdfloor apartment Federal investigators have recovered a bullet from a chair The FBI said that it was fired from a 9millimeter weapon and could have been fired from either a rifle or a pistol

BULLET THAT HIT BLACKMUN HOME SEEN BY POLICE AS A RANDOM SHOT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/07/us/bullet-that-hit-blackmun-home-seen-by-police-as-a-random-shot.html,Officials investigating a shooting incident at the home of Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun of the Supreme Court last week told him almost immediately that they believed the shot was fired randomly or at a distant target and was not aimed at him a police spokesmen said today Detective Tom Bell of the Arlington County police force in Virginia said agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had determined soon after they arrived at Justice Blackmuns apartment in Rosslyn Va that the bullet that shattered a window of the apartment last Thursday night was probably a random shot possibly from Georgetown a few hundred yards across the Potomac River which divides Virginia and the District of Columbia No one was injured in the incident which was not disclosed to the public until Monday The shooting has been widely linked in the news media to threats that Justice Blackmun has received in the past from antiabortion extremists because he wrote the Supreme Courts majority opinion on abortions in 1973 when it ruled that women have a constitutional right to obtain abortions Identical Death Threats Cited But lawenforcement officials raised doubts about the antiabortion connection when they confirmed today that death threats were made in identical letters mailed to Justice Blackmun to Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr of the Supreme Court and to Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York The officials said the letters did not mention the abortion issue Senator DAmato who has taken a strong stand against a liberal abortion policy said the letter had a Buffalo postmark and arrived at his Washington office last Thursday The FBI has acknowledged that based on ballistic studies the bullet that struck Justice Blackmuns apartment may have been fired accidentally The bullet fired from a 9millimeter weapon broke a window of the Blackmuns thirdfloor apartment about 11 PM Thursday and lodged in a chair The ballistic investigation completed within hours after the incident was said to have traced such a steeply descending trajectory from the Blackmuns window to the chair that the shot would have had to have traveled a distance too great to have been aimed A Justice Department official who asked not to be named said the FBI at first ordered all information on the incident withheld a news blackout that lasted for four days and then delayed for two more days confirmation of the accidental theory for a policy reason directed from the top An FBI spokesman denied a report that said top officials of the bureau delayed stating the shooting was an accident in order to avoid the appearance that the agency might be minimizing an apparent attack on Justice Blackmun or its purportedly antiabortionist source Asked to comment on this report Lane Bonner a spokesman for the bureau said the delay in disclosing the incident was the result of an FBI request that it remain unreported by local lawenforcement officials in Virginia and was routine in cases involving national leaders while still under investigation
WHO LEADS CATHOLICS?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/08/opinion/who-leads-catholics.html,As the Roman Catholic Church in America prepares for the 20year review of the Second Vatican Council in Rome next autumn those who study and report on Catholicism may legitimately wonder whether the Churchs leaders have enough credibility left for the meeting to matter much one way or another It might be asked who cares what Pope John Paul II and the bishops do and say Didnt The New York TimesCBS News Presidential election exit poll show that despite all the sound and fury from the bishops abortion was the key issue or one of two key issues for only 8 percent of Catholics  less important than for Protestants Arent American Catholics saying in effect to paraphrase the title of the old Bing Crosby film that they are going their way not the Popes or the bishops way Evidence available from national surveys suggests that the picture is far more complex  that Catholic leaders still have considerable clout Sometimes On the one hand the efforts of the Pope and the bishops to tighten up discipline on sexual morality do not seem to have been very successful In the late 1970s just before the Popes visit to America in which he sternly repeated traditional sexual teaching 22 percent of American Catholics thought that premarital sex was always wrong 16 percent felt that abortion should not be available when the mothers life was in danger and 20 percent disapproved of the provision of birthcontrol information to teen agers according to the National Opinion Research Centers General Social Survey Today despite the vigorous insistence of the Pope and support for that insistence from the bishops the figures are 21 percent on premarital sex 14 percent abortion 13 percent birth control Thus there was no measurable effect of the leaderships outspoken support for traditional teaching Nor was there any change on issues in which most Catholics still support the traditional position then and now about 70 percent disapproved of extramarital sex and homosexuality On the other hand according to National Opinion Research Center data the American bishops pastoral letter on nuclear weapons has had to my surprise and dismay a dramatic impact on attitudes of American Catholics toward armaments In 1983 before the letter was issued 32 percent of American Catholics and Protestants thought that too much money was being spent on the military armaments and defense A year after the letter the percentage was still 32 for Protestants but had jumped to 54 for Catholics  an astonishing social change in so short a time The difference is statistically significant It is difficult to think of what other factor besides the letter could affect Catholics and not Protestants in this country Previously many would have predicted that the Catholic leadership would have an impact on issues commonly perceived as religious and not on issues commonly seen as political But the opposite seems to have occurred The phenomenon is all the more surprising because it is reasonable to assume that most Catholics know of the peace pastoral only through what they saw on television or read in the newspapers Perhaps the reason is that the nuclear weapons pastoral letter was issued precisely at a time when all Americans were becoming increasingly concerned over issues of nuclear disarmament It might be that the bishops helped the Catholics focus their concerns more clearly and explicity Or perhaps they concluded that while Church leadership does not know what it is talking about when the subject is sex it may well know what it is talking about when the subject is peace Do the Pope and bishops still matter Yes sometimes When Perhaps when the laity want them to matter For the first thousand years of Catholic history this would have been called the consent  or acceptance  of the faithful It would be an interesting subject for someone to raise at the autumn meeting in RomeB

FETAL HEALTH: NEW EARLY DIAGNOSIS STUDIED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/09/style/fetal-health-new-early-diagnosis-studied.html,When Debbie and Maury Fisher of Highland Park Ill learned that their second child a son Todd now 4 years old had TaySachs disease they decided not to have more children But when Mrs Fisher found herself pregnant again in July 1983 she underwent a test that informed her in the 11th week of her pregnancy that she would have a normal child The test called chorionic villi sampling was performed at the Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago because as Mrs Fisher explained I was only the sixth woman in this country to have it and the first one at risk for TaySachs disease who wanted to continue the pregnancy Today her third child a daughter is a healthy 1yearold Since her test several hundred women in this country have undergone chorionic villi sampling at 16 hospitals The Government has begun a national study to determine the safety and accuracy of the procedure and to compare it with amniocentesis In the relatively painless chorionic villi sampling a catheter guided by ultrasound is inserted into the uterus to withdraw a small amount of chorionic villi tissue Chorionic villi are protrusions on the chorion membrane which surrounds the fetus and later becomes the placenta Though the sample is not part of the fetus itself it does contain fetal tissue so analyzing it can divulge a wealth of information Both Were Carriers For the Fishers the test was critical Tay Sachs is a genetically transmitted fatal disease Both parents are carriers and there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be afflicted Todd is blind deaf helpless and unable to recognize anyone Mrs Fisher said I jumped at the chance to have the test I didnt want to wait for amniocentesis which is done halfway through the pregnancy a point at which I had already been feeling the baby move for three weeks Terminating it at that point would have been terribly difficult although I would have done so First developed in Denmark China and Italy chorionic villi sampling became the subject of an investigation begun last month by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development a division of the National Institutes of Health Seven medical centers are partipating in the study Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago Prentice Womens Hospital and Maternity Center at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco The goal is to study 2500 to 5000 women Half of them will have the chorionic villi sampling the other half amniocentesis which remains the standard assessment of fetal health for women over 35 or those at risk for abnormalities The new test is also being performed by nine other medical centers including the New York HospitalCornell Medical Center which have received the approval of the Food and Drug Administration That agency has jurisdiction because the catheter used is classified as an investigational device In amniocentesis fluid is withdrawn through a hollow needle from the amniotic sac and is analyzed The hope of obstetricians and geneticists is that with its early test and rapid diagnosis chorionic villi sampling will eventually replace amniocentesis Amniocentesis is done later in pregnancy the 16th week and takes longer to produce results three to four weeks Chorionic villi sampling is done between the 8th and 12th week most often in the 9th or 10th Preliminary findings including whether Downs syndrome is present can be had in one or two days a thorough analysis comparable to that offered by amniocentesis takes two weeks A woman deciding to have an abortion can do so in the first trimester if she has had chorionic villi sampling after amniocentesis she must have a more complicated and less safe secondtrimester abortion But despite its apparent advantages questions about chorionic villi sampling persist primarily about whether it is more likely to provoke a miscarriage than is amniocentesis and to what degree As Dr Robert J Desnick professor of pediatrics and genetics and chief of the division of medical genetics at Mount Sinai Medical Center put it Although a total of more than 4000 chorionic villi samplings have been done internationally we dont know the risks because no one has studied them We are estimating a miscarriage risk of between 1 and 2 percent based on early data But we really do not know what the risk is at any given week of gestation And when you analyze the fetal wastage in miscarriages you find that 50 percent of the losses have chromosomal abnormalities so they may well have occurred without any testing at all Dr Laird Jackson director of the division of medical genetics at Thomas Jefferson University and Hospital in Philadelphia has kept records of the procedures conducted there In our genetics division we have done the test on 670 patients since Sept 1 1983 and have had a loss rate of 18 percent he said He said no comparable study has been done for amniocentesis patients but that the miscarriage rate in that population is generally ranked at onehalf to threequarters of 1 percent Dr Jackson also maintains a registry of results reported by 49 researchers from 20 countries Since mid1983 there have been 4175 cases in which chorionic villi sampling was used with a 41 percent loss rate he said It is probably higher in other countries because of technical differences The new study will represent the first effort anywhere to make a random test of the population A random study is considered to be the only way to compare the two procedures in an unbiased fashion Unless we do a proper controlled randomized study we will never be able to accurately compare the risk or to make informed decisions Dr Desnick said In the Government program at the seven medical centers women will be asked to participate in a random study in which they will be assigned to one of the two procedures Women who wish to choose their own test may do so and be included in some phases of the study So far chorionic villi sampling appears to offer the same degree of accuracy as amniocentesis in its ability to detect genetic abnormalities including chromosomal metabolic and blood borne conditions The only significant exception is the test for neural tube defects which include spina bifida and anencephaly but a blood serum taken from the mother in the 16th week can compensate for that In the experience of Dr Eugene Pergament director of the division of medical genetics at the Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago There are few women who do not choose to have chorionic villi sampling once they hear it explained he said If the test can be done earlier than amniocentesis and the results are available faster and if an abnormality is detected the ability to act in the first trimester makes it much more appealing though the loss of any pregnancy is very upsetting However those women for whom prenatal testing is most crucial the ones over the age of 35 when risks of defect escalate may also be the ones least able to accept a risk of miscarriage At that age they tend to have more difficulty conceiving and the press of time makes future pregnancies uncertain As Dr Richard L Berkowitz professor and acting chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai said If it does turn out that amniocentesis carries a lower risk of pregnancy loss people with a history of infertility or difficulty becoming pregnant might be better served by that For them the cost of losing a pregnancy is especially high But if the major concern is in not having an abnormal pregnancy then a slightly increased risk associated with this diagnostic procedure may be worth taking Besides the promise offered by chorionic villi sampling it also carries the potential for abuse Like amniocentesis it reveals the sex of the fetus Some authorities fear it could be used as a method of sex selection and lead to abortions if the parents have conceived the wrong sex Physicians inform patients that they do not perform either test for such a purpose but Dr Pergament said a few people who claim that they want the test for appropriate reasons actually use it to ascertain the sex Many People Prefer Boys Many people prefer to have boys so girl fetuses may be aborted a rejection of healthy females merely on the grounds that they are female said Dr Daniel Callahan director of the Hastings Center which studies ethics in medicine and science in HastingsonHudson NY But he said although we cannot outlaw abortion no matter what the ground we must make it clear this is not an acceptable reason As Beth Fine a genetics counselor at the Michael Reese Hospital said in some situations information about sex is critical A number of women have come here because they carry the gene for muscular dystrophy she said a condition that they have a 50 percent chance of passing on to sons One woman from a distant city came here recently and told me that she had watched her brother die of the disease Miss Fine said When she became pregnant the chorionic villi sampling showed she was carrying a male She terminated that pregnancy and is now expecting again so she will return for another test This is different from gender selection there is a disease involved The national study is expected to be completed within four years If it proves that chorionic villi sampling is safe and accurate It will become for many women the procedure of choice Dr Desnick said and it will change the timetable of our thinking
ABUSING CHILDREN BY SMOKING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/09/opinion/abusing-children-by-smoking.html,Most of us know about the dangers of smoking And most of us are deeply concerned about child abuse But what we have overlooked is the child abuse caused by smokers In fact smoking adults inflict serious damage upon the developing child starting with its embryonal life and continuing throughout its formative years A nursing baby may receive nicotine in breast milk or by inhaling it  Physicians have long cautioned pregnant women to be sparing in their use of alcohol certain drugs caffeine and diagnostic Xrays for fear of injuring the fetus Only recently have they extended these warnings to cigarette smoking Although there is still some skepticism about this increasing numbers of scientific studies show that regular smoking can injure the fetus in several ways some of which are immediately apparent while others develop more slowly and insidiously For example within minutes each cigarette puff introduces carbon monoxide and nicotine into the maternal blood The former reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen while the latter constricts the placental blood vessels diminishing their lifesupporting flow As a result the unborn child is temporarily deprived of its normal amount of oxygen If this deprivation is repeated often enough it could irreparably damage the fetal brain an organ uniquely sensitive to a lack of oxygen Besides its effect on blood vessels nicotine crosses the placenta to the fetus where it acts as a cardiovascular stimulant and a respiratory depressant This reaction was demonstrated when a group of pregnant women smoking only two cigarettes experienced a rapid rise in blood pressure and pulse rate Within five minutes the heart rate of their fetuses accelerated and was accompanied by abnormal breathinglike motions  both a sign of fetal distress These findings carry serious implications if one multiplies the five puffs per cigarette inhaled by the average smoker by 20 the number of cigarettes in a packaday habit and then by 270 the number of days for gestation This means that the fetus is subjected to at least 27000 physical chemical insults beginning with its earliest stages of rapid cellular division when it is most vulnerable and continuing through its uterine life This also applies to the many other harmful components of tobacco smoke for example cyanide some of which could prove even more noxious than nicotine What is the cumulative impact of these repeated assaults on the fetus Experiments on animals show that the byproducts of tobacco smoke can upset fetal metabolism and the endocrine gland system More ominously the byproducts are known to derange the unborns genetic material the cells DNA  This disruption of fundamental mechanisms so vital for normal fetal development could explain why one in five unsuccessful pregnancies occurs in women who smoke regularly Or more specifically why these women have a higher incidence of spontaneous abortions stillbirths and premature deliveries than nonsmokers Their babies are apt to be smaller at birth more susceptible to diseases of early infancy and are at increased risk of dying at that time The babies have a tendency to be born with cleft palates and hare lips and later on may exhibit such difficulties as shortness in size lower scores in social adjustment behavioral problems impaired reading abilities hyperactivity and mental retardation Chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke is now known to be more than just a temporary nuisance it may contribute to cancer in later life Moreover a growing child continually exposed to it is prone to develop ear nose and throat infections bronchitis pneumonia asthmatic attacks and decreased lung efficiency There are of course other consequences for example adult smokers create an environment in which young people are tempted to begin smoking Realizing all this what responsible woman can persist in a habit so threatening to her young Using self discipline she can minimize the risk of a complicated pregnancy and imposing lifelong physical and mental handicaps upon her child Clergymen educators parent teachers associations and legislators should speak out against tobacco just as they do against alcohol drugs drunken driving radioactivewaste disposal dioxin and abortion Because more than 50 million Americans smoke this form of child abuse may be the most pervasive of allB

company determines how many millions of dollars it should set aside to pay to women injured by its Dalkon Shield contraceptive device The reserve could reduce or wipe out the companys quarterly dividend Connaught Laboratories stopped filling orders for whooping cough vaccine which causes severe reactions in a few children because it could not get liability insurance at an acceptable rate The halt aggravated a national shortage of the vaccine The FMC Corporation passed up a chance to produce precision bearings for helicopter rotors because the potential profit did not justify the liability risk if the helicopters crashed according to Robert H Malott FMCs chairman THESE are the sort of experiences that are fostering an image of a tort system gone slightly crazy  an impression promoted by American business in its attempt to get a bill through Congress that would make it harder for individuals to win product liability suits The lobbying effort probably got a boost in December from the widely publicized competition among American lawyers to sign up victims of the gas leak disaster in Bhopal India for multimilliondollar liability suits against the Union Carbide Corporation Tales about people filing and winning seemingly farfetched personal injury cases  tort suits in legal jargon  circulate at cocktail parties and enliven office talk Some are apocryphal Others are quite true such as the one about an overweight man who had a heart attack trying to start the engine of a lawnmower He won a 175 million jury award against Sears Roebuck  Company which sold him the mower on the ground that the starter rope was too hard to pull If it was real easy to pull the rope they probably would have been subject to liability because a child could have pulled it says Victor E Schwartz

liability of American business in recent years as an effective way to compensate the injured and to force American companies to make product safety a priority The pathbreaking decisions in liability cases issued mainly by state courts over the last 20 years draw the applause of such consumer activists as Ralph Nader who says that even now 95 percent of those who have been injured by defective vehicles and products never get justice Guido Calabresi a professor at Yale Law School who will become its dean on July 1 adds that those who create the risk ought to bear the cost of it If injuries caused by dangerous products become a cost of doing business for a producer he said there will be an incentive to make safer products to avoid liability And the true costs to society of unavoidably dangerous products will appropriately be included in the form of higher prices paid by everyone who uses the products he said As such theories have won adherents in the judiciary tort law once a legal backwater over which few executives lost sleep has become a major headache for many businesses and a path to bankruptcy for a few The threat of liability is an uninvited guest at product planning meetings introducing uncertainty into costandprice projections for new merchandise As a lawyer and as a businessman its awfully difficult to project or forecast for your client said John F Schmutz senior vice president and general counsel at EI du Pont de Nemours  Company You tend to shy away from things that really would benefit society if you didnt shy away from them In addition Mr Schwartz of the Product Liability Alliance argues that liability rules vary so greatly from one state to another that companies shipping products nationwide dont know what the rules are The problem has united American business behind a bill sponsored by Representative Robert W Kasten Jr Republican of Wisconsin that would substitute a uniform Federal law for many of the liability rules that have evolved from state court decisions The most controversial provision would require plaintiffs to prove negligence to win damages in cases involving design defects such as gas tanks that tend to explode in rear end collisions But consumer activists organized labor and the lawyers who prosecute liability cases earning contingency fees if they win are strongly opposed to the bill and its chances of passage are uncertain Their opposition has prevented passage of earlier Kasten bills THE rapid growth of product liability cases is one aspect of a trend that has made torts into the most dynamic field of American law The judicial activism that has begun to slacken in constitutional law continues strong in personal injury suits The effects are wideranging Doctors are sued for malpractice Local governments find themselves the defendants in tort suits when people trip on cracked sidewalks Party givers are sued when guests drive away drunk and get into smashups And manufacturers wholesalers and retailers are sued when someone is harmed by a product they made handled or sold Just last week  A Federal Court jury was hearing evidence on whether the morning sickness drug Benedectin caused birth defects The trial involves more than 1000 suits If the verdict is yes it could ultimately cost Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals the drugs maker hundreds of millions of dollars  A trial began in a California state court in San Francisco over who will pay billions of dollars in injury claims filed by more than 25000 people exposed to asbestos The case pits five asbestos companies against more than 50 insurance companies and the insurance companies against each other To accommodate lawyers from more than 55 companies the trial is being held in a 1000seat former high school auditorium New avenues in product liability surface constantly Next month Melvin Belli who has won the sobriquet king of torts will begin to plead the case of the late John Galbraith a Californian who suffered from cancer and emphysema Such suits against American tobacco companies as well as their advertising agencies could grow in number For many businesses  especially the chemical petroleum and pharmaceutical industries  the most ominous prospects are posed by what are called toxic torts suits brought by thousands of people who suspect their sicknesses or their childrens birth defects were caused by exposure often years or decades previously to drugs or to toxic substances such as asbestos The many billions of dollars in claims for respiratory illnesses allegedly caused by asbestos and other suits for the cost of removing it from buildings have driven the Manville Corporation and two other manufacturers into bankruptcy court And with litigation mounting over illnesses allegedly caused by proximity to toxic waste dumps workplace exposure to benzene formaldehyde pesticides and other chemicals and drugs asbestos may be only the tip of a toxic torts iceberg The Justice Department says the total asbestos liabilities could exceed 40 billion with claims rising above 100000 as more people get asbestosis or cancer The proliferating number of tort cases is making product liability insurance a major cost problem for business especially for small companies After rising in the mid1970s and then stabilizing or even declining rates are going up sharply this year And the number of recorded jury verdicts awarding 1 million or more to plaintiffs in personal injury suits has soared from one  the first  in 1962 to 8 in 1970 26 in 1975 134 in 1980 and 360 in 1983 the last year for which complete figures are available according to Jury Verdict Research Inc of Solon Ohio Most business lobbyists acknowledge that tort liability has not yet become a major financial drain or bottomline concern for the vast majority of American companies But some face huge liabilities AH Robins for example had committed 259 million as of Sept 30 to settle about 7700 claims of women who said its Dalkon Shield intrauterine device had caused infertility involuntary abortions and pelvic disease With at least 3600 more claims pending the company and its outside auditors and lawyers have been unable to agree on the size of a reserve to cover litigation costs Because the charge against 1984 earnings has not been set results for the year have not been reported This prompted last weeks announcement that the annual meeting scheduled for April 23 had been postponed indefinitely The company has been paying quarterly dividends of 19 cents a share But no firstquarter dividend could legally be paid if the loss reserve were set high enough to wipe out the estimated 367 million in stockholder equity Robins has also been accused of going to extremes in seeking to minimize its liability A former inhouse lawyer accused the company last year of destroying internal documents to conceal evidence that it had known the Dalkon Shield could be hazardous And a Federal appeals court found in February that a key expert witness for the company had perjured himself with complicity of counsel The company has denied the charges TORT law has a dual purpose to compensate injured victims and deter unreasonably dangerous or negligent behavior by business and others This often involves striking a balance between fostering productive activity and protecting safety The law traditionally struck this balance by requiring a plaintiff to prove rather clearly that the negligence or fault of a specific defendant was the proximate cause of an injury Even some business leaders acknowledge that this approach sometimes left deserving plaintiffs without compensation As products and manufacturing processes became more and more complex a negligencebased concept of liability imposed an onerous burden on an injured victim seeking compensation forcing him or her to prove for example what part of a product failed FMCs Mr Malott who is also head of the Business Roundtables Task Force on Product Liability said in a 1983 article in the Harvard Business Review Thus his article said there was a need  concerned lawyers judges and scholars agreed  for legal grounds other than negligence on which injured individuals could recover damages for injuries or loss Judges became increasingly bold in contriving such grounds and legal scholars such as Professor Calabresi of Yale provided them with rationales for doing so based on economic efficiency as well as compassion They reasoned that the cost of injuries involving dangerous products should be borne by the manufacturers who are in the best position to minimize the risks and to spread the cost through insurance After decades of gradual erosion common law barriers to tort plaintiffs began to tumble in the 1960s most conspicuously in state court decisions that imposed strict liability for injuries caused by dangerous products The supreme courts of California and New Jersey have led the way and juries became increasingly generous in awarding damages The United States Supreme Court which lacks jurisdiction over state law issues has stayed on the sidelines In toxic tort cases some judges and juries faced with the difficulty of either proving or disproving whether an illness was caused by a toxic substance have accepted highly debatable statistical evidence and scientific theories as a basis for imposing liability For example in a test case last May a Federal judge in Utah ordered the Government to pay 24 million in damages to the families of nine people who died of cancer after being exposed to fallout from nuclear tests more than 20 years ago The scientific evidence as to whether radiation had caused the cancers was inconclusive The judge in effect held the radiation guilty until proven innocent and said the Government had negligently failed to warn residents of the possible hazard at the time of the tests Thousands of similar atomic radiation claims are pending In a somewhat similar case seven manufacturers of Agent Orange agreed last May to pay 180 million to settle a class action by Vietnam veterans allegedly harmed by the defoliant Some 200000 claims have been filed for a share of the fund Later Federal District Judge Jack B Weinstein of Manhattan who had pushed for a settlement questioned whether the case should have been brought at all He said no factual connection of any substance had been shown between the diseases and Agent Orange Now he is weighing a proposed plan to distribute the money without requiring the claimants to prove Agent Orange caused their maladies IN Mr Malotts opinion things have gotten out of hand causing an almost unfathomable expansion of the scope of liability with exorbitant costs to society And some Administration officials decry what Michael J Horowitz general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget calls the radicalization of tort law by liberal activists seeking a judicially imposed insurance scheme Such criticisms of the evolving tort system are viewed by Mr Nader as a campaign by powerful economic interests to deny redress to injured people and snuff out efforts by progressive judges to inject some fairness and compassion into the law The deck has traditionally been stacked against injured people seeking reasonable compensation he said adding that for every proplaintiff judge looking for ways to award compensation there is a probusiness judge looking for ways to deny it The worst feature of the Kasten bill in the view of of Mr Nader and other opponents is the provision that would require plaintiffs to prove negligence in cases involving defects in the design of products wiping out some state rules that hold a company liable in such cases The real rationale of strict liability is that people cannot always prove negligence even when its there says Jay Angoff of Congress Watch a consumer advocacy group THE most vigorous opponents of the Kasten bill are the plaintiffs trial lawyers who bring the product liability suits against companies and have a direct financial stake in the continuation of the current system They typically get onethird of any award Mr Nader defends the trial lawyers against business people who deride them as selfseeking ambulance chasers Never underestimate the deterrent effect of having thousands of plaintiffs lawyers all over the country who have a vested interest in holding those doctors and corporations feet to the fire he said Still lawyers might get much less if a system were devised that made it easier for clients to win reasonable compensation without extensive litigation In 1983 the Rand Corporation estimated that 63 cents of every dollar spent on asbestos litigation went to the opposing attorneys and for legal costs leaving only 37 cents to victims A move is afoot in Congress to do something about this Senators Slade Gorton Republican of Washington and Christopher Dodd Democrat of Connecticut are developing proposals to guarantee swift but limited compensation to people injured by unsafe products who might otherwise have no redress under the Kasten bill or who prefer to avoid litigation The compensation would be limited to actual costs such as medical expenses and lost wages and would not include compensation for pain and suffering or punitive damages The liability of defendants who were not negligent would thus be limited and the risks delays and costs of litigation might be avoided Proponents say this approach would be good not only for injured victims but for businesses The major losers one Senate aide said would be the lawyers who earn contingency fees under the current system Mr Nader and the trial lawyers have a different view He says that the proposals being considered would shortchange injured people and serve as a scaffolding on which business lobbyists could later add special interest amendments Business lobbyists do not much like the idea of such a compensation system either They would prefer the Kasten bill the way it is now with a plaintiff required to prove corporate fault to collect But they acknowledge that they might have to give something up to get something
A False 'Scream',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/11/opinion/a-false-scream.html,Five physicians were invited by CBS Morning News last week to see the film that President Reagan hopes will persuade Americans to deny women the abortions he feels they shouldnt have If every member of Congress could see The Silent Scream he said recently they would move quickly to end the tragedy of abortion The physician film reviewers were recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for their expertise in ultrasound analysis and fetal development What they saw was the abortion of a 12weekold fetus What they heard was a narration by Dr Bernard Nathanson We can see the child moving rather serenely in the uterus    The child senses agression in its sanctuary    We see the childs mouth wide open in a silent scream     Do we Not according to those five medical experts Said Dr John Hobbins of the Yale University School of Medicine There is no evidence    to indicate that the fetus has the capability of purposeful movement has the capability to perceive the things that Dr Nathanson said it was perceiving to struggle against whatever he said it was struggling against From Dr Fay Redwine of the Medical College of Virginia Any of us could show you the same image in a fetus who is not being aborted From Dr Jennifer Niebyl of the John Hopkins School of Medicine The fetus at this gestational age is really exhibiting strictly reflex activity Does the fetus sense the most mortal danger imaginable No Dr Hobbins says because the cortex isnt yet functioning and it is the cortex that perceives pain changes things processes information So why does the fetus suddenly appear to be thrashing about Because Dr Niebyl points out right before Dr Nathanson says the fetus is reacting and fighting aggressively he has the film in very slow motion Then as the suction catheters placed he turns it on to regular speed Its really very misleading Yes The Silent Scream is very misleading Three physicians provided by the National Right to Life Committee tried to rebut the first groups testimony and couldnt Instead they spoke of a confusion about what we mean about perception About how yes the cortex isnt developed but the thalamus is About how abortion is not an anatomical issue    It isnt even an issue involving pain But that is the issue in The Silent Scream And its a false issue

RATE OF PREGNANCIES FOR U.S. TEEN-AGERS FOUND HIGH IN STUDY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/13/arts/rate-of-pregnancies-for-us-teen-agers-found-high-in-study.html,American teenagers become pregnant and give birth and have abortions at significantly higher rates than do adolescents in other industrialized nations according to a study released yesterday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute Moreover the United States is the only developed country where teen age pregnancy has been increasing in recent years the study reported The pregnancy rate for Americans 15 to 19 years old stands at 96 per 1000 compared with 14 per 1000 in the Netherlands 35 in Sweden 43 in France 44 in Canada and 45 in England and Wales the countries that were studied in depth as a backdrop to the experiences of American teenagers The teenage abortion rate for the United States was found to be as high as the combined abortion and birth rates for the other countries studied Although pregnancy rates among black American teenagers are much higher than rates among white teenagers  163 pregnancies per 1000 as against 83 per 1000  this does not account for the United States high rates compared with industrialized nations Overall the authors of the study concluded that the lowest rates of teenage pregnancy were in countries that had liberal attitudes toward sex had easily accessible contraceptive services for young people with contraceptives being offered free or at low cost and without parental notification and had comprehensive programs in sex education We had many results that we did not expect and many assumptions made by Americans that simply were not supported by fact said Jeannie I Rosoff president of the institute a re search and educational organization These are among the more dramatic findings  Ready access to abortion services does not lead teenagers to have more abortions  The availability of welfare and other forms of support for young mothers is not a motive for parenthood  Greater availability of birth control and sex education does not lead to an increase in teenage pregnancy The twoyear project conducted by the Alan Guttmacher Institute with research assistance from the Office of Population Research at Princeton University and funding from the Ford Foundation compared in general terms teenage pregnancy rates in 37 developed countries It provided a detailed examination of teenage sexual practices pregnancy and abortion rates along with public policy in six of those countries including the United States The institute is named for the familyplanning pioneer Representatives from Sweden the Netherlands Great Britain and France described their countries policies and experiences at a news conference at the Gramercy Park Hotel Canada which was included in the case history phase of the project was not represented at the news conference The six countries were selected because they closely resembled the United States in socioeconomic and cultural characteristics and because they had accumulated data regarding teenage sexual behavior Their rates of adolescent pregnancy were also known to be markedly lower than that of the United States leading researchers to hope that they might discover approaches to the problem that might be attempted here The information for the project was collected from reports published by organizations including the United Nations the World Bank and the International Federation of Planned Parenthoods and from questionnaires sent to all foreign embassies in the United States to American embassies abroad and to the family planning agency in the countries studied Teams of researchers visited each nation that was used as a case study In the United States the report said Teenage birthrates are much higher than those of each of the five countries at every age 15 through 19 by a considerable margin The contrast is particuarly striking for younger teenagers In fact the maximum relative difference in the birthrate between the United States and other countries occurs at ages under 15 With more than five births per 1000 girls aged 14 the United States rate is around four times that of Canada the only other country with as much as one birth per 1000 girls of camparable age The presumption that low adolescent birth rates reflect the frequent use of abortion  and that as a consequence American teenagers seldom resort to abortion  was not borne out in the study According to the data by the time they are 18 years old 60 of every 1000 women in the United States have had an abortion By contrast in the Netherlands which also ranked the lowest in abortion use only 7 of every 1000 women age 18 had had an abortion For England and Wales the figure was just above 20 per 1000 for France it was about 30 for Canada about 24 and for Sweden about 30 The study also dashed any notions that high birth rates among young black women accounted for the discrepancy between the United States and other countries The birthrate among white American teenagers alone is almost double that of the next ranking country on the list England and Wales the report said If only the birthrates among whites were used for comparison it added the differences in adolescent birthrates internationally would be lowered by only one fifth leaving the United States still far ahead in teenage childbirth What accounts for notably high rates of adolescent pregnancy in the United States Not the level of sexual activity according to the institute study which ascertained that activity rates were roughly the same among countries in the case study The median age for the first act of intercourse was determined to be slightly less than 18 in the United States France Great Britain and the Netherlands with activity starting about a year earlier in Sweden and a year later in Canada Nor do maternity and welfare benefits appear to promote pregnancy As the report noted In most cases the overall level of support appears to be more generous than that provided under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program in the United States The use of contraceptives however was said to be one of the most significant factors As Jacqueline Darroch Forrest research director at the Alan Guttmacher Institute said Teenagers in the United States are less likely to use contraception and among those who do use it they are less likely to use the pill which is considered to be the most effective method In the United States there is considerable concern about health hazards posed by the birthcontrol pill although a recent survey by the Food and Drug Administration shows that pill use has increased among all Americans Similar fears are not common elsewhere speakers at the news conference said Almost everywhere abroad birth control is either free or inexpensive for teenagers Isabelle Maury a writer who specializes in health issues said that in France for example On Wednesday schools are closed so the family planning centers have a special day for teens then and contraception has been available without charge to them since 1974 In Sweden the provision of both birth control and sex education was made a government priority when the abortion laws were liberalized in 1975 Though American teenagers have access to birth control through clinics and physicians and efforts to obtain parental consent when prescription methods are dispensed have been struck down in courts there is still a perceptual barrier keeping young people away There is a vast network of clinics here Dr Forrest said but in many minds they are linked to service for the poor and to older women And although parental consent is not a legal requirement here many private physicians still demand it before they will prescribe anything The authors of the report also viewed sex education which varies from one school to the next in this country as a major factor affecting adolescent pregnancy In Sweden regarded as a model by sex education proponents an official curriculum is mandatory and is taught in all grades It emphasizes not only the sexual components of initimate relationships but the emotional ones as well Beyond sex education the way in which government views its role in teenage sexuality seemed to make a difference according to the report In general terms it found that other governments perceive their function as preventing pregnancy The onsite investigators noted in the report that they were struck by the fact that in those countries the government as the main provider of preventive and basic health services perceives its responsiblity in the area of adolescent pregnancy to be the provision of contraceptive services to sexually active teenagers The report states One reason for the more successful experience of the European countries may be that public attention was generally not directly focused on the morality of earlier sexual activity but rather was directed at a search for solutions to prevent increased teenage pregnancy and childbearing In the United States the Reagan Administration and in particular conservative lawmakers and the Office of Adolescent Programs in the Department of Health and Human Services have said repeatedly that their role is to prevent sexual activity and promote chastity among the young Jo Ann Gasper newly appointed deputy assistant secretary for population affairs whose jurisdiction includes adolescent programs said yesterday that she could not comment on the report until she had had an opportunity to read it Experts at the news conference agreed with the report in advocating more open communications on sexual issues at home and in public institutions abroad Said Evert Ketting a sociologist from the Netherlands In Holland we felt it was time to get rid of old taboos We never discuss the question of Should teenagers have sex Teenagers can and do talk out their ambivalences and their feelings and we think of it all as human relations

America's Pregnant Children,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/15/opinion/america-s-pregnant-children.html,According to legend and a song lyric from Gypsy to sell something youve gotta have a gimmick In the United States the triedandtrue gimmick is sex Sex sells jeans cars perfume underwear and detergents It powers hit records best sellers TV dramas and videos Its a staple of many an evening with a VCR and the reason for many a celebritys celebrity It is big bucks the gimmick that makes the merchandise move The retailers are happy and so are the customers But what about the children Can America shield its children from the sexual sell It doesnt even want to try Then at least can society teach them how to deal with sex Yes but it doesnt want to try that either Obviously not even though the United States leads nearly all other developed nations of the world in teenage pregnancy abortion and childbearing rates Not when were the only developed country where teenage pregnancy has been increasing Not when its our most vulnerable adolescents  girls under 15  whose pregnancies account for the maximum difference between our teenage birthrate and that of other countries Americas children are bearing children at a rate unparalleled in the Netherlands Sweden France Canada England and Wales  countries similar to the US in general cultural background and economic development The reason according to a study just released by the Alan Guttmacher Institute is not that American adolescents are more apt to be sexually active The median age at first intercourse is very similar for all the teenagers in the countries studied Neither is it because adolescents in other countries have more abortions They have fewer Nor is the teenage fertility in this country explained by the very high pregnancy rates among black teen agers many of whom live in a degree of poverty unknown in Europe The rate for white adolescents alone exceeds that for the other teenage populations Nor does welfare appear to serve as an incentive to outofwedlock childbearing If so one would expect lower birthrates here than in the other five countries where overall support is more generous Instead the answer lies in our reluctance to accept responsibility for the sexual revolution  and prepare our children for life in this changed society Contraceptive counseling and sex education in the schools can make a powerful difference yet they suffer constant attack Some states severely limit the advertising and display of contraceptives and its the rare TV channel that will run even the most tasteful contraceptive advertising Although the pill is accepted as a highly appropriate contraceptive method elsewhere and despite the everincreasing scientific evidence of its safety and efficacy for adolescents it is greeted with ambivalence and suspicion here Teenagers need help to avoid pregnancy and to avoid abortion Thats exactly why France the Netherlands and Sweden have committed themselves to providing contraceptive services for young people But as the Guttmacher study puts it the nature and the intensity of religious feeling in the United States serve to inject an emotional quality into public debate dealing with adolescent sexual behavior Consensus and common sense become impossible America wallows in the byproducts of sexual liberation  raunchy TV suggestive advertising and pornographic movies At least in theory the adults are able to manage One can only feel pity however for the teenagers and for their children

LONG ISLAND OPINION ;   'YESTERDAY YOUR DAUGHTER HAD AN ABORTION',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/17/nyregion/long-island-opinion-yesterday-your-daughter-had-an-abortion.html,Dear Mr and Mrs Doe Yesterday your daughter Jane had an abortion This was a traumatic experience considering shes only 15 but while she was understandably nervous about the procedure itself what really frightened her was the possibility that you might find out After all how many times did you threaten her with remarks such as If I ever learn that you slept with that guy dont bother to come home again or If you ever get pregnant I swear Ill kill you both While you probably never meant that literally it sounded pretty real to her so when she discovered she was pregnant she came to me remembering that I had helped a friend who was in a similar situation last year Jane is fine but if she seems a bit depressed for a while just show her a little extra kindness and please dont ever tell her you heard what happened Is it not ironic though that at the recent PTA meeting when the proposal to institute a sex education curriculum in our schools was being discussed yours was one of the loudest voices raised in opposition You argued that sex education would promote promiscuity and that such matters should only be discussed at home and are strictly the responsibility of parents not teachers in public schools Since Janes situation probably would have been avoided had she taken a sex education course I ask you to reconsider your position and help us institute sex education in time to prevent Janes younger sister from having to come to me for help herself in a couple of years Yours truly A concerned friend THIS letter is fictitious but hundreds of teenage girls right here on Long Island and thousands nationwide find themselves in a situation similar to Janes each year Along with drug abuse and suicide pregnancy is one of the most serious problems facing teenagers today Accordingly the question of abortion is no longer a private matter but rather a national political issue with right to life and freedom to choose groups vilifying each other and unfortunately forgetting the root of the problem While abortion may be the swiftest solution for those whose morals dictate against that procedure the altenatives are equally uninviting The girl may marry the father and attempt to establish a household a prospect that often ends in failure and divorce If marriage is not possible she may bear the child and give it up for adoption Besides the stigma of having been an unwed mother she may carry a lifelong burden of guilt from concern over her childs future and the child itself may later be seriously troubled by curiosity about the identity of his or her natural parents The third alternative is that the mother may attempt to raise the child alone To do so she almost inevitably drops out of school and often must rely upon public assistance for her and her baby to survive A recent study by the National School Boards Association determined that teen age pregnancy has reached epidemic proportions that pregnant students just seem to disappear that pregnancy remains the main reason why teens drop out of school and that while gifted and talented students and the learningdisabled have advocacy groups teenage mothers are the forgotten many a tragic loss of human potential to our society Recently a letter was published in The Suffolk County News criticizing those who endorse sex education in the public school system and containing the following sentence These groups promote abortion on demand homosexuality pornography sex education in our schools and all the other social evils that may destroy our country and our youth I am convinced that it is the children of parents who share similar attitudes particularly in suburban middleclass areas who may most likely be faced with an unwanted pregnancy sometime during their teenage years To compound the problem these unfortunate youngsters will not only be the least prepared for the crisis but also will be wholly unable to turn to those who should be the foremost pillar of a childs support  namely parents Last fall some members of the Suffolk County Legislature advocated a public campaign to promote sexual abstinence among teenagers In a world where nearly every aspect of teenage life television magazines advertising movies clothing and peer pressure encourage sexuality any effort to promote sexual abstinence would be unrealistic and futile In an essay on this page dealing with ways to reduce alcoholrelated car accidents I argued that instead of through fear and prohibition by the removal of the mystique and by education in the use and abuse of alcohol the incidence of drunken driving would be markedly reduced I believe that precisely the same approach should be taken in confronting the problem of teen age pregnancy Certainly those who believe that young people should abstain from sexual activity until marriage have a perfect right to instill that belief in their children but considering the nature of teenagers anyone who holds too steadfastly to an absolute position is inviting rebellion Just as a teenage boy because of his inexperience resulting from parental restriction regarding alcohol may find himself in serious difficulty after a party during which he succumbed to inevitable peer pressure so too the sexually naive teenage girl may find herself in trouble because her parents would permit no discussion of sex from fear it would be stimulating and promote promiscuity Since the three choices a pregnant teen ager has  abortion adoption or raising the child alone  are all equally unsatisfactory the only solution is to prevent pregnancies from occurring in the first place Because abstinence is not a realistic approach the way to prevent pregnancies is to accept the fact that many teenagers are sexually active and to teach them how to make love without making babies In junior high school every boy and girl should be given a thorough education in human sexuality and reproduction They should become completely familiar not only with their own reproductive system but with that of the opposite sex as well Instruction should include discussion of sexually transmitted diseases proper public behavior prevailing social and community standards and the need to develop personal sexual morality but the heaviest emphasis should be on the various methods of contraception available to them Where will a child obtain such an education Certainly not from his or her parents whose own knowledge may be at best meager and more likely totally lacking Sex education can be given only by specially trained teachers presented in a neutral nonemotionallycharged classroom environment supported by all the available resources of the school system including textbooks brochures and pamphlets the blackboard films and other audiovisual aids materials and equipment Knowledge of sexual matters can only serve to provide teenagers with power over their own bodies and give them a better chance to control their lives and destinies Rather than encouraging promiscuity sex education does precisely the opposite By removing the myths the mysteries and the taboos surrounding sex by education in means of birth control and by encouraging personal morality and responsibility pregnancies will occur only when wanted the lives of thousands of teenagers will be immeasurably improved and the most divisive problem of all the morality of abortion will itself become a dead issue
BUBBLES IN A MEDIA BATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/17/books/bubbles-in-a-media-bath.html,Carol Brightman is the coauthor of Larry Rivers Drawings and Digressions  INTIMATE STRANGERS  The Culture of Celebrity By Richard Schickel 299 pp New York Doubleday  Company 1695  THE transformation of the celebrity system in American society from the ornamental frill it was 50 years ago to the dynamic mechanism it has become today  a force for selling the news the arts and the President  is a historical event worth pondering Like most authentic changes in the culture this one has crept up on us in disguise wearing the mask of Hollywood legends from the preceding scene We tend to worry about government with Bonzos guardian in the White House or painting with publicity machined superstars at the easel or the ascension of face cards in journalism and miracle workers in medicine If we have children we wonder how as adults they will recapture the fantasies inspired by He Man Voltron and Strawberry Shortcake In all this we retain the illusion that these stars have been injected into cultural orbit where they jostle against heavenly bodies more deserving of our attention But the culture of celebrity is more pervasive than that If Richard Schickel is right only celebrity power now offers Americans a sense of community  common idols if not common ideals  in a world where the traditional communitarian forms    are honored more in the nostalgic breach than in living lives Mr Schickel who is a film critic for Time and the author of several books about Hollywood celebrities presumably knows the difference between the actual life of a media star and the mythic personality But it is not a difference that interests him in Intimate Strangers Far more important in his view is the awesome difference between life in the intimate grid where most of us pursue our daily rounds and life in the national grid where life is charmed by incalculable opportunities Or  seems to be to the obscure millions who are submerged in a media bath from Olympus Personally Mr Schickel is undecided on the question of how much real power celebrities have  an irresolution that weakens his grasp of reality outside the media but lends a strange poignancy to his evocation of the culture of celebrity itself  The books most persuasive argument for the influence of celebrity on personal life in fact was suggested by the authors own youthful romance with Hollywood It began in the 1930s in a Middle Western suburb a benign backwater where even World War II when it came along seemed    rather entertaining nothing there could compare with the thrill of hearing Cecil B De Mille chat with the stars who had just appeared on The Lux Radio Theater When De Mille said good night from Hollywood the word rolled off his tongue with a rising inflection on the second syllable that sent shivers down his young listeners spine Soon the stars would be transformed by a masterstroke of press agentry into good guys and gals but then they were swells disporting themselves around white pianos in yachting blazers or jodhpurs alongside women in satin gowns For the young Mr Schickel who followed the news of this fabulous crowd in gossip columns on radio talk shows in Life Look and the fan magazines they became at once the negation of hometown reality and its most potent emblem of fame I didnt know quite how    I might fit into that larger scene but I began wanting to he recalls when I was quite young When Hollywoods image of the stars was democratized in the 1940s it became easier to identify with them The Other Place The Better Place as Mr Schickel saw their realm seemed to be attainable The passport one guessed was talent And niceness of course  For the author  and one supposes for many journalists of his generation  the passport was the profession that gathered and disseminated information from the powerful and promised some intimacy with them as well Later Mr Schickel would discover the fear and suspicion along with the currying of favors that journalists often inspired But that too was part of journalisms appeal Practically speaking the thought of being a gadfly a cynical idealist knowing but independent  in short the plagueonbothyourhouses hero  insulated the writer and his public from the disturbing clash of interests in the real world Elsewhere in Intimate Strangers the Other Place becomes the celluloid nowhere of George W S Trows Within the Context of No Context And Mr Schickel turns his attention to the millions who labored under the delusion    that nowhere was somewhere and that somewhere was bound to be nowhere  that is to say a place where nothing good interesting or important ever happened The ultimate personification of this delusion is the pathologically isolated person who must strike at celebrity to possess it for himself  the Presidential assassin Murder Mr Schickel observes is the ultimate intimacy  Of course there really are people out there who dwell in the twilight zone of the tube For less bedazzled folk however there is a serious flaw in Mr Schickels jeremiad  his failure to distinguish between media hype and real events He is adept at documenting the trumpery in Presidential public relations he is brilliant on President Kennedys Camelot and equally astute when he shows how the idea of celebrity substitutes for an inquiry into quality and purpose in the arts On the subject of the political protests of the 60s on the other hand or the more recent battles over abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment Mr Schickel is trapped by his own cynicism The former is dismissed as a mass adolescent hysteria that was implicitly encouraged by televison while the colorful quarrels of the latter would never have reached our legislative halls were they not so gaudily telegenic One suspects he is offended by these noisy intrusions into The Better Place In the end we find Mr Schickel stranded on the brink of the chaos that lies beyond the pale of the media and the nothingness of the culture of celebrity Only once in the book does he ask In whose interest is it finally to convert the political process into a long running television show and then only to quote Gore Vidal on the culpability of the bankers and the corporate elite whose single issue is profitability It is a proposition he declines to test because he believes the perversity ennui and ultimate stupidity of the people who think they are running the show makes a conspiracy unlikely His refusal to look deeper is too bad One would like to learn something more from a veteran journalist about the men who with their mastery of a national grid of idols and ideals have after all realized a dream of emperors throughout history  Mr Schickel who does not believe that the forces of corruption can be turned back thinks the very plucky can continue to hold out    preserving in their secret encampments the essence of a decent civilization    If we cannot say no in thunder we can at least whisper subversion among ourselves Intimate Strangers is not a whisper that will be heard round the world but coming from a disillusioned insider it is warning enoughB  No Celebrity He Richard Schickel doesnt believe that Intimate Strangers his book about celebrity makes  him one Nobody calls up authors for television appearances except when theyve got a book out he says Were only famous for that Warholian 15 minutes With time out of course for two commercials Mr Schickel has been writing about celebrities  the celluloid variety  for 20 years He majored in political science and history at the University of Wisconsin This book is a tribute to that past he says A lot of the values in the book grow out of that university thought in the 1950s In Intimate Strangers he applies what he knows about movie celebrity to other kinds  including the political celebrity that leads right to the Oval Office Celebrity was once limited he says but now its spread everywhere Is celebrity power good or bad I think its bad in the sense that it distorts judgment  political and esthetic Television has changed things it projects reality but alters it Celebrity has now become what John Updike called the PanAmerican talk show   Herbert Mitgang

O'CONNOR INTENDS TO SHIFT MORE PRIESTS TO PARISHES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/20/nyregion/o-connor-intends-to-shift-more-priests-to-parishes.html,Archbishop John J OConnor said yesterday that he intended to strengthen parishes in the Archdiocese of New York by transferring priests from archdiocesan offices into churches The Archbishop said he planned to reorganize the headquarters of the archdiocese at 1011 First Avenue and replace as many as possible of the 38 administrators who are priests with lay people nuns and deacons He said eight of the priests would be put in parishes by July and that others would follow until the fewest possible were involved in administration The parishes are hurting Archbishop OConnor said in an interview yesterday the first anniversary of his installation at St Patricks Cathedral Thats where the action is After a year in which he emerged as a national spokesman for the Roman Catholic church the Archbishop said that he would turn his attention with renewed zeal to his own archdiocese Alienated Catholics This past year has been a learning year he said Now I have been through all the major annual diocesan events One of my major objectives will be to try and win back the huge number of alienated Catholics starting with getting them back to mass With 18 million Catholics the New York Archdiocese is the fourth largest in the country It includes the boroughs of Manhattan the Bronx and Staten Island and seven counties north of the city But there is a worsening shortage of priests in the archdiocese with its 411 parishes There are 754 active priests but their median age is 55 and the number of seminarians is declining I buried 32 priests in my first year the Archbishop said Convocation in Washington The interview was held aboard an earlymorning flight to Washington where the Archbishop attended an executive meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops The Archbishop wore a clerical collar a gold bishops cross and a lapel pin with a red rose that is the symbol of the antiabortion movement The 65yearold prelate appeared serious and tired showing little of the enthusiasm of his first homily a year ago when he put on a baseball cap at one point and declared at another Ich bin ein New Yorker The Archbishop who made trips to Ethiopia and Central America in the last few months said he was suffering from amebic dysentery In the interview the Archbishop made these points  He is preparing to hold a diocesan synod in 1987 of priests nuns and laymen to tackle the major problems facing the archdiocese  He wants every priest to be able to celebrate mass in Spanish and will begin sending priests to a university in Puerto Rico to study the language  He plans a major effort to increase the number of priests beginning with a Youth Rally at Yankee Stadium on May 1 that he hopes 40000 people will attend I am convinced that we are coming out of a fallow period during which young people saw instability and uncertainty he said  He is disturbed by the declining health of priests and is instituting a physical fitness and nutrition program for them at St Josephs Seminary in Yonkers  He will continue to speak out on national issues although he has some regrets about the way his message was received in the last year The Archbishop drew national attention in the months before the 1984 Presidential election by accusing Geraldine A Ferraro the Democratic VicePresidential candidate of distorting the Catholic position on abortion Regrets Over Ferraro Question In the interview Archbishop OConnor said that when he criticized Mrs Ferraros position he was only responding to questions from reporters I regret the question was ever raised that it became a national issue and that it is still turned over and over he said He said that he also regretted that his statements may have hurt people when I never intended them to hurt people Nonetheless he added I dont think I had the vaguest influence on the elections He had criticized Mrs Ferraro for having signed a letter two years earlier sponsored by a group called Catholics for a Free Choice that said there was a diversity of opinion among Catholics on abortion The Archbishop also attacked the press for misquoting him with regard to Mrs Ferraro and for implying that he supported President Reagans reelection The President believes that abortion should be outlawed The press took little note the Archbishop said of his criticism of Reagan Administration policies Sunday after Sunday I was preaching about the homeless and poverty and war he said I never saw one indication that I was attacking President Reagan But the moment I mentioned abortion I was attacking Geraldine Ferraro and Walter Mondale MX Missile Project Criticized The Archbishop a former military chaplain said his criticisms of Reagan policies on social issues and weapon systems had continued since the election In a letter released this weekend he urged Congress to vote down funds for the MX missile because he wrote the needs of the poor were so much greater than those of the military In the interview the Archbishop said I dont hear anybody asking but this is OConnor who was supposed to be handinglove with the President Maybe he isnt Maybe he is looking at the morality of the situation  He said that he attributed his treatment by the press to a great hostility toward the church position on abortion It is necessary to discolor me in some way he said On three recent occasions  during his visits to Ethiopia and Nicaragua and during testimony before Congress  public figures have asked him to use his influence with the White House The myth has been internationalized he said 3 Meetings With Reagan The Archbishop said that he never met President Reagan until he was appointed Archbishop of New York Since then he has seen Mr Reagan only three times once as part of a delegation of bishops to talk about Administration policies toward the poor Archbishop OConnor said a second myth had developed  that he is in constant contact with Pope John Paul II in Rome In fact he said he has met with the Pope only twice since becoming Archbishop and each time other bishops were present He illustrated the stuff of myths with the following story Several months ago when the Pope called an extraordinary synod to discuss the results of the Second Vatican Council the Archbishop said he received a call from a reporter who asked if the Vatican had consulted him about the synod Come to think of it the Archbishop said he responded the Pope has probably been trying to call me but he couldnt get through because as you people are always saying Im always on the phone with President Reagan Attention Surprises Him Archbishop OConnor who spent four years in New York as an auxiliary bishop before going to Scranton Pa in 1983 said he was continuously surprised by the national and international attention that his remarks as Archbisop attract He said that no one paid him much heed when he said the same things as Bishop of Scranton While he plans to turn a greater part of his attention to the needs within the archdiocese the Archbishop said he will have to continue with his busy travel schedule He is the president of the Catholic Near East Welfare Association which will require at least one trip to the Middle East and other trips are planned as part of his chairmanship of the Committee on Social Development and World Peace of the Bishops Conference I have a responsibility to the church universal he said as his plane touched down at Washington National Airport
ATTACKS ON CHIEF JUSTICE PRESAGE HOT '86 CONTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/20/us/attacks-on-chief-justice-presage-hot-86-contest.html,Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird of California the target of seven ouster efforts in her eight years in office is again facing ferocious attacks as she runs for a full 12year term The office is nonpartisan there will be no opponent on the ballot and the voting is still 19 months away Nevertheless at least three organizations have begun raising money to defeat the Chief Justice and it appears millions of dollars will be spent on all sides Opponents of Chief Justice Bird who served as an aide to Gov Edmund G Brown Jr a Democrat before being named to the Supreme Court are putting heavy emphasis on capital punishment and what they see as her bias against its use Some of Justice Birds backers say the efforts to unseat her conceal a plan to allow Gov George Deukmejian a conservative Republican to pack the states highest court And each side is suggesting that the others campaign is being manipulated by zealots rightwing or left wing With spending and feelings at such levels the judicial campaign could overshadow the reelection efforts of Governor Deukmejian and Senator Alan Cranston a Democrat Other Justices Targeted Under the California system members of the Supreme Court periodically face the electorate for a yesorno retention vote No justice has ever failed to hold onto office but Chief Justice Bird had a close call in 1978 winning 517 percent of the vote Her detractors this time are seeking to deny reconfirmation to three other Justices appointed by Democratic Governors Cruz Reynoso Joseph R Grodin and Stanley Mosk Justice Malcolm Lucas appointed by Governor Deukmejian is not a target of any of the organized groups whose leading members are mostly Republican The other Justices on the seven member court Otto M Kaus and Allen E Broussard do not face the voters next year The Chief Justices supporters paint her as a talented dedicated hard working jurist dogged by a howling mob of bigots her critics describe her as opinionated and willful and as a major political mistake by Governor Brown When Mr Brown nominated her to be Chief Justice in 1977 Miss Bird had served two years as Secretary of Agriculture and Services She had a leading role in the creation of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board which Brown admirers consider one of his key accomplishments By a 2to1 vote the Committee on Judicial Appointments confirmed Miss Birds nomination to serve until the 1978 election when she barely won retention for eight years of an unexpired term Governor to Vote No Controversy has stirred around her service on the court ever since Seven attempts to vote her out of office have been announced though only five of these efforts got to the point that petitions were circulated and none won enough signatures to require a vote on recalling her from office Governor Deukmejian who has been a bitter critic of Justice Bird opposed those efforts telling his supporters that the time to deal with the issue was in a regular retention election Last November with such an election two years off the Governor said he would vote against retaining the Chief Justice Those who sought to have her recalled from office said she lacked sufficient experience for the job and injected political bias into judicial disputes It was an insult to the voters of California to put such an inexperienced person into the highest position in the states court system just because she happened to know the Governor said William Dannemeyer a Republican Congressman who represents an Orange County district State Senator H L Richardson a leading fundraiser for conservative Republicans said She has alienated every section of public opinion in California at some time or other I think the prolife people agriculture interests insurance companies the district attorneys all will be out to defeat her The California District Attorneys Association last month announced its opposition to reconfirming Chief Justice Bird and Justices Reynoso and Grodin According to Gregory Thompson executive director of the 2500member association most of the prosecutors believe the three justices are biased against capital punishment Representative Dannemeyer said the Chief Justice had voted to reverse all 33 death penalties that have come before her on the court At this point Chief Justice Bird who is 48 years old is taking no public role in the campaign Citing her position she routinely refuses requests for interviews to answer charges like those of Representative Dannemeyer and Senator Richardson Litmus Test Is Seen But a spokesman Bill Zimmerman says the campaign against her is part of a national movement aimed at setting up a litmus test for judges based on such issues as abortion capital punishment and the treatment of criminals Mr Zimmerman manages the Committee to Conserve the Courts the Justices campaign vehicle which he says now has 230000 and is aiming at a multimilliondollar budget Chief Justice Bird has a number of notable supporters Sponsors of a 1982 fundraising dinner included Mr Brown the former Governor Shirley Hufstedler who has been a Federal appeals judge and United States Secretary of Education Tom Bradley the Mayor of Los Angeles and Senator Cranston She has strong defenders among former presidents of the California bar and in various bar associations Three groups have registered fund raising campaigns to oppose her reconfirmation The Republican Party has also voted to oppose her despite the nonpartisan nature of the office Mr Zimmerman has described Bill Roberts leader of one of the groups organized to oppose Justice Bird as a partisan campaign management specialist who generally serves conservative Republican interests Mr Roberts has helped to direct gubernatorial campaigns for Ronald Reagan and for Mr Deukmejian and Mr Zimmerman suggested that the antiBird campaign was an effort by political conservatives to enable Governor Deukmejian to change the tone of the Supreme Court Charge Is Denied An associate of Mr Roberts Fred Karger said there had been no conversations with Deukmejian about the campaign against the Chief Justice And he said of Mr Zimmerman Hes about as far left a campaign manager as you can get noting that he had managed campaigns for California Assemblyman Tom Hayden who years ago gained prominence as an antiwar radical and for Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago Representative Dannemeyer is active in California Bird Watcher another committee that opposes the Chief Justice A third group Californians to Defeat Rose Bird has raised 175000 from its first test mailing campaign said Janet Byers a spokesman Spokesmen said both these groups would use direct mail in attempts to raise multimilliondollar campaign funds

COURT WEIGHS SUIT BY PARENTS IN BIRTH OF AN UNSOUGHT CHILD,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/24/nyregion/court-weighs-suit-by-parents-in-birth-of-an-unsought-child.html,For most parents there are few events more joyous than the arrival of a healthy normal baby But for Brian and Susanne OToole of Queens things were not so simple Five years ago Mr and Mrs OToole decided that for their financial and physical health three children were enough Mr OToole who was 25 years old at the time brought home barely 200 a week as a subway car cleaner for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority His family was already jammed into a onebedroom apartment And Mrs OToole who was about to undergo her third Caesarian section had been told that any more such deliveries could endanger her life So in January 1980 after the birth of her third child she was sterilized She said the doctors at Jamaica Hospital who performed the operation known as a tubal ligation had assured her that she would never become pregnant again ChildRaising Costs Sought But about one year later Mrs OToole became pregnant KellyAnne Marie OToole was born in November 1981 two months after her parents had filed a malpractice claim against the doctors who performed the surgery and against the hospital where it was done What distinguishes the OToole case from other wrongful pregnancy cases is the damages they seek the costs of raising KellyAnne until she reaches adulthood KellyAnne and the lawsuit that revolves around her have grown together She is now 3 years old a pretty strawberry blonde with bright blue eyes And the case of OToole v Greenberg et al is before the states highest court which has been asked in effect to balance the peculiar blessings and burdens of parenthood Whether the defendants were in fact negligent is not for the court to decide Rather it must decide what kinds of damages Mr and Mrs OToole would be entitled to should negligence be established at a later trial In its ruling expected this week the New York Court of Appeals must do two more things It must delineate how far the obligations of negligent health care providers extend And for the first time it must address an issue that has divided courts elsewhere whether the birth of an unexpected but normal child can ever be a compensable injury Courts in New York and elsewhere have long recognized that the birth of an unsought child is not always an unmitigated blessing Earlier this month for instance a State Supreme Court Justice in Manhattan ruled that the mother of a child born after a doctor negligently failed to diagnose her pregnancy in time for an abortion could collect damages for the resulting delay in her training as a psychologist the cost of her own therapy and the trauma of giving up the child for adoption Moreover while the Court of Appeals has ruled out wrongful life lawsuits brought by children who were born with abnormalities because of doctors negligence it has permitted their parents to sue for the costs of their care But it has never extended that principle to normal children who but for the carelessness of doctors would never have lived at all In most other states where the issue has been examined courts have tended to balk when asked to extend damages to normal costs of childrearing usually on the grounds that the joys of raising a healthy child far outweigh whatever financial burdens it brings They have warned that parents seeking damages must denigrate their own offspring making what one court has called emotional bastards of the children involved Courts in at least six states have nonetheless permitted parents to recover normal childrearing costs in such cases though in five of them the damage award must be reduced by whatever psychic benefits can be said to accrue from the child Parental pleasure softens but does not eradicate economic reality the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 1982 The OTooles seem to fit that maxim Since KellyAnnes birth they have had to leave their crowded onebedroom apartment in Ridgewood Queens and move in with Mr OTooles mother nearby To make ends meet Susanne OToole has begun driving a cab working as much as 88 hours a week We love her and everything but thats not the point said Mr OToole of KellyAnne Its hard bringing up too many children This is something that never should have happened Parents Ruled Out Abortion A State Supreme Court Justice in Queens ruled against Mr and Mrs OToole in 1982 suggesting that they could have chosen an abortion For the OTooles however the risks of a fourth Caesarian section were preferable Im a Catholic and Catholic people dont have abortions Mrs OToole said The only way I would have had one is if I would have dropped dead on the table without one In 1983 however the Appellate Division Second Department in Brooklyn upheld the lower courts decision It cited a second case decided the same day involving a man who had fathered a child after undergoing a vasectomy To award damages for the birth of a normal infant Presiding Justice Milton Mollen wrote in that case would be incompatible with contemporary views concerning one of lifes most precious gifts But last May in an acknowledgment of the issues importance the Appellate Division asked the Court of Appeals to review its ruling John Anthony Bonina of Brooklyn the lawyer representing Mr and Mrs OToole maintained that the law has always required wrongdoers to compensate their victims for whatever harm naturally flows from their wrongful conduct and that doctors should not be more insulated than others He said it was inconsistent for courts to speak of the preciousness of life while compensating couples who unlike the OTooles decide to have a fetus aborted Mrs OToole underwent her tubal ligation when she was 23 years old She believed that such surgery was proper under Roman Catholic teachings since it was done to safeguard her health not primarily for contraceptive purposes The procedure was performed at Jamaica Hospital by Dr Benjamin Greenberg and Dr Arthur Leber Most wrongful pregnancy cases against makers of birthcontrol mechanisms have failed usually because consumers are explicitly warned that they can fail When surgery is involved it is much easier to prove negligence In February 1982 Justice Joan Marie Durante of State Supreme Court in Queens ruled that the OTooles could recover damages for their medical expenses physical injuries and the pain and mental anguish of the pregnancy But she barred recovery of childrearing expenses citing a 1980 Appellate Division ruling that such damages could have been avoided through abortion Lawyers for the defendants warned that any attempt by the court to the balance the pleasures and pains of parenthood could lead to an undignified courtroom soap opera Andrea M Alonso of Morris  Duffy in New York who represents Dr Greenberg and Dr Leber went on to say that requiring her clients to pay for child support would be unfair as well as unwise In court papers she argued that theirs is the true right to life position To allow the plaintiffs to recover the ordinary costs of rearing Kelly OToole would mean that they would experience all the fun joy and affection of raising her while Drs Greenberg and Leber are burdened with all the bills she wrote The ultimate wrong that can be committed is to cause another persons death she continued It would be the antithesis of this principle to hold the doctors responsible because they did not prevent Kelly OTooles healthy life The plaintiffs should have limited recourse against the doctors for their failure to consign their daughter to oblivion
NEW JERSEY OPINION;   CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION: SOME LEGISLATORS ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/24/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-constitutional-convention-some-legislators-are-willing-take.html,ARTICLE V of the Constitution allows for two amendment methods The first  passage by Congress and then ratification by three fourths of the state legislatures  is the path that has been used for all 26 amendments The second which allows for twothirds of the state legislatures to call upon Congress to convene a Constitutional Convention has never been used successfully Yet the nation may be just two short steps away from holding its second Constitutional Convention the first was in 1787 Although the prospect is frightening there seems to be little public concern about its serious implications In the last 8 years 32 states have issued a convention call to Congress so that an amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget can be enacted The calls of only 2 more states are needed to reach the requisite 34 Michigans Senate recently passed such a resolution and several states  including New Jersey and Connecticut  have bills pending that if enacted could result in a convention Here in New Jersey three resolutions not just one were introduced in 1984 They are still pending despite opposition from the Democratic legislative leadership Why is there on the one hand such a fear of a Constitutional Convention And why on the other hand have so many states rapidly and fearlessly adopted resolutions calling upon Congress to convene a convention The answer to the first question is that there are simply too many imponderables too many unanswered and unanswerable questions Legal scholars have serious doubts whether a Constitutional Convention once it sits can be limited to dealing with one specific agenda item or even a set of related issues Could a convention deal only with the balanced budget matter or could it also set tax policy and place limits on defense spending Could it abolish the Bill of Rights and tinker with other pieces of the Constitution including previously adopted amendments Nobody knows for sure because the Constitution doesnt spell out the conventions limits or procedures and the only precedent we have is 1787 It should be recalled that the 1787 Constitutional Convention broke every legal restraint designed by Congress to limit its power and agenda In fact it violated specific instructions from Congress to confine itself to amending the Articles of Confederation and instead discarded the Articles and wrote our present Constitution Besides the problem of a possible runaway convention there are other complex questions For example  How would the delegates be chosen  How can we be sure they reflect broad national interests and not narrow ones only  Will those who are best qualified by experience to deal with the Constitution such as members of Congress and state legislatures be barred from serving because they hold public office Moreover legal opinion is split on the question of Congressional authority to impose its will on a convention There is a considerable body of opinion to the effect that the Congressional role in the convention process was intended by the Founding Fathers to be minimal What then How could a crisis of gargantuan proportions be averted if for example the Supreme Court and Congress differed on some procedural aspects of the convention process Consider what could conceivably happen if equal rights amendment supporters frustrated by the narrow defeat in getting the amendment passed through passage by Congress and ratification by state legislatures decided to use the convention method to achieve their goal Its quite possible they could get 34 states to call for a Constitutional Convention And what if they managed to get elected delegates to the convention Would they while theyre at it add an amendment to guarantee freechoice for women who want an abortion Despite all of these concerns 32 states have called on Congress to convene a convention to enact a balancedbudget amendment Presumably they acted out of the firm conviction that the American public overwhelmingly favors the concept of a balanced Federal budget Some supporters of the balanced budget argue that they dont actually want a Constitutional Convention that they are using the threat of one as a device to force Congress to focus  and act  on an amendment and then submit it to the states for ratification This argument is irresponsible because the act of holding a Constitutional Convention may well be short of a declaration of war the single most solemn and important act our Government can undertake The issue here is not whether a balanced budget is desirable or always necessary many think it isnt or even whether a balancedbudget amendment should be enacted by the Congress and then ratified by threequarters of the states The issue is whether America can afford to take the terrible risks inherent in holding a Constitutional Convention Especially frightening was the cavalier attitude of the 32 legislatures More than half held no public hearings or extended debate and some didnt even record the votes of their respective members Such distinguished national figures of different political philosophies as Melvin Laird the Secretary of Defense under President Richard M Nixon and Arthur J Goldberg a former Supreme Court Justice view the prospect of a Constitutional Convention with grave concern Mr Laird has characterized the convening of a convention as an act fraught with danger and recklessness and Mr Goldberg said that no single issue is so important as to warrant jeopardizing our entire constitutional system of government Yet some New Jersey legislators are willing to take the risks and in 1985  the year of The Big

HOW REAGAN PROMOTES ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/26/opinion/how-reagan-promotes-abortions.html,Whatever one feels about the complex issue of abortion Americans have reason to regret President Reagans antiabortion crusade By eliminating United States aid to private familyplanning organizations around the world he is actually promoting rather than discouraging abortions As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee considers this policy this week  in an amendment to the foreign aid bill  it should make some effort to calculate the number of additional abortions it would cause and the extent of suffering it would produce  The President has for example eliminated all American support for the International Planned Parenthood Federation a principal provider of familyplanning services in Africa Latin America and Asia He did so because the federation uses some of its money less than 1 percent none of it from the United States for abortion related activities Included in the 17 million grant that the federation will not receive this year was 5 million worth of contraceptives  condoms birthcontrol pills and intrauterine devices that were to be distributed free in more than a hundred countries These contraceptives would avert 776000 unwanted pregnancies according to the federations estimates It is also estimated that some 13 percent of unwanted pregnancies in countries served by the federation are terminated by abortions If Washington withholds the contraceptives it has promised we can thus count on an additional 100880 abortions  A number of these abortions will be ineptly performed As a result some women will die and many others will suffer health complications What of the pregnancies not intentionally aborted Allowing for miscarriages and stillbirths some 625000 unwanted babies will be born many into absolute poverty and to parents unable to care for the children they already have Before the new arrivals reach one year of age at least 60000 of them will die from starvation malaria infectious diseases and malnutrition These children will have been denied the right to life from the moment of their birth Last year during the election campaign Mr Reagan asserted that the population explosion if you look at actual figures has been vastly exaggerated One Administration spokesman at the United Nations Population Conference in Mexico City last summer dismissed global population growth as a neutral phenomenon And one of Mr Reagans advisers Julian Simon has declared that we should cry not with worry and sadness but with enthusiasm and joy at the increasing number of people The President also apparently intends to withhold assistance to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities This AliceinWonderland attitude would be comical if the problem and the Administrations response were not so tragic The figures speak for   themselves world population increased by at least 80 million in 1984 more than ever before in one year It now appears that even with expanded family planning the annual increase will reach 100 million before the trend can be reversed About 90 percent of the increase will occur in the poorest already overpopulated countries Today as happened yesterday and will happen again tomorrow 40000 children will perish Tonight 400 million children will go to bed if they have a bed hungry Right now in Brazil alone 11 million abandoned children are living in the streets Meanwhile as human population swells the lifesustaining ability of the earths biological systems  the oceans grasslands croplands wetlands and forests  is declining in many parts of the world There is hope however Studies show that most couples in developing nations wish to limit the size of their families Given the chance they will practice birth control That somewhere between 25 million and 40 million pregnancies are terminated each year by abortion indicates the enormous unmet demand for familyplanning services worldwide International family planning must be supported as never before if we are to move toward a more stable world and a decent quality of life for all people Ignorance ideology and mindless optimism must not be allowed to hinder this effortB
LEGISLATORS MOVE ON ATOM EXPORTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/world/legislators-move-on-atom-exports.html,Congress took a first step today toward cutting off foreign aid for any country that smuggles equipment or technology out of the United States for use in nuclear weapons The legislation does not name a specific country but was proposed by Representative Stephen J Solarz in response to recent disclosures about the activities of a Pakistani who was arrested for attempting to smuggle devices useful in making nuclear weapons out of the United States Mr Solarz a Brooklyn Democrat is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs which approved the proposal to close an important loophole in United States laws aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons Under current law the panel said the United States must suspend economic and military assistance to any country that detonates transfers or receives a nuclear explosive device But under current law the penalty does not apply to a country that merely acquires nuclear technology from the United States in violation of American export law Administration View on Measure Herbert G Hagerty director of Pakistan Afghanistan and Bangladesh affairs at the State Department said the Reagan Administration does not oppose the Solarz amendment Pakistan is receiving almost 626 million in aid this year and the subcommittee recommended the same amount for next year rejecting the Administrations request for a 25 million increase The Solarz proposal would not be retroactive It would apply to any country that exports illegally or attempts to export illegally any material equipment or technology to be used in the manufacture of a nuclear device The subcommittee recalled the arrest last year of a Pakistani national endeavoring to smuggle out of the United States parts useful in the detonation of nuclear explosive devices This it said raised questions about Pakistans commitment to the worldwide nonproliferation regimen Other ForeignAid Issues The restriction was one of many issues brought up today as House and Senate committees began work on foreign aid legislation for the next fiscal year Secretary of State George P Shultz protested against efforts by some in the House to prohibit the sale of advanced weapons to Jordan unless Jordan agrees to recognize Israel and to enter direct peace talks Mr Shultz said we strongly oppose that proposal because it would raise doubts about the United States ability to meet Jordans defense needs against the threat of Syrian and Sovietsponsored terrorism Meanwhile members of Congress from both houses began a bipartisan effort to change the Reagan Administrations policy on aid to international population control programs Restriction on Aid Under that policy announced last August at a United Nations conference in Mexico City the United States no longer contributes to private organizations that perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations Three subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee have approved an amendment that would block this policy The amendment would prohibit the President from denying funds to any foreign Government or private organization that performed abortions in a voluntary family planning program so long as no United States money was used to pay for them Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum Republican of Kansas has prepared a similar amendment which says that the State Department must not subject private organizations to requirements more restrictive than those applied to foreign governments The United States gives population assistance to foreign governments through segregated accounts that cannot be used for abortion Mrs Kassebaum said that many recipients of US population assistance are expressing severe reservations about their ability to comply with the new policy If it is not changed she said the result will be a crippling of our population aid programs particularly in those areas of the world most in need of this assistance Move Against Contraception Some antiabortion groups having won tighter restrictions on abortion last year are now urging the State Department to curtail support for contraceptive techniques such as pills and intrauterine devices which they describe as abortifacients Members of these groups expressed their concerns this month in a meeting with M Peter McPherson Administrator of the Agency for International Development Faith Ryan Whittlesey assistant to the President for public liaison said she was concerned that State Department policies would prevent prolife natural family planning organizations from qualifying for any AID funding Population programs that receive aid from the United States must either provide a wide range of contraceptive methods such as birth control pills and intrauterine devices or refer couples to clinics that provide such services Mrs Whittlesey in a letter last week to Mr McPherson warned that this policy threatened the Presidents credibility with the prolife movement which has been so supportive of the President
DAMAGES ARE DENIED FOR 'WRONGFUL' BIRTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/nyregion/damages-are-denied-for-wrongful-birth.html,The birth of a normal healthy child is not an injury for which parents are entitled to damages New York States highest court ruled yesterday In a unanimous decision the Court of Appeals rejected a claim for childrearing expenses made by the parents of a baby girl who was conceived about a year after her mother underwent a sterilization operation The decision marks the first time New Yorks highest court has defined the liability that doctors and hospitals face in such wrongful conception cases With it New York joins the majority of states whose courts have ruled on the issue in saying that the birth of an unwanted but otherwise normal child cannot be considered compensable Purely Economic Interests In view of our societys acknowledgment of the sanctity of life it cannot be said as a matter of public policy that the birth of a healthy child constitutes a harm cognizable at law the court stated in an opinion written by Judge Matthew J Jasen The moral social and emotional advantages arising from the birth the courts opinion Jasen continued are to be preferred to the protection of purely economic interests The case decided yesterday was brought by Brian and Susanne OToole of Queens whose daughter KellyAnne was conceived despite the tubal ligation that Mrs OToole underwent at Jamaica Hospital in 1980 following the birth of her third child The OTooles who are Roman Catholics had decided upon sterilization because they felt they could afford no more children and because each of Mrs OTooles deliveries had been by Caesarean section Argument Incongruous In a footnote to its sixpage decision the court distanced itself from a ruling by a lowercourt judge He had held that the OTooles were not entitled to compensation for the cost of raising their 3yearold daughter because they could have chosen an abortion The Court of Appeals called that argument incongruous with settled public policy Because the birth of a healthy child was not an injury the court stated it was legally irrelevant whether the OTooles could have reduced their damages through abortion or any other way The OTooles contended that by refusing to award them childsupport payments the law was effectively penalizing them for carrying KellyAnne to term  a violation of their right to privacy Andrea M Alonso the lawyer for the defendants Drs Benjamin Greenberg and Arthur Leber expressed satisfaction with the decision Although the benefits of par enthood are intangible and complex and immeasurable the court has found that as a matter of law they outweigh its financial burdens she said The OTooles lawyer John Anthony Bonina of Brooklyn called the courts reasoning unrealistic and said he was considering an appeal to the United States Supreme Court on the privacy question Somehow the ruling doesnt seem to deal with the economic realities of the hardworking struggling middle class who pay their bills follow the Good Book and do everything they can to raise their children he said The OTooles are made of sturdy stuff and theyll survive but theyre disappointed Claim Filed in 1981 Mr OToole then a 25yearold subway car cleaner and his wife filed their malpractice claim in September 1981 two months before KellyAnne was born Listed as defendants were Jamaica Hospital and its Family Practice Clinic as well as Dr Greenberg and Dr Leber In the suit the OTooles sought not only compensation for the expenses and physical and emotional injuries from the unwanted pregnancy  which the courts have upheld in earlier wrongful conception cases  but also the estimated 85000 needed to feed clothe and educate KellyAnne until she reached adulthood Two lower courts had previously ruled that the OTooles were not entitled to such costs The case now returns to State Supreme Court in Queens where the OTooles must prove the defendants were negligent to collect damages for the remaining elements of their claim The case could take several years to complete

WHO'S A PERSON NOW?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/31/books/who-s-a-person-now.html,ENGLISHSPEAKING JUSTICE By George Parkin Grant 104 pp Indiana University of Notre Dame Press Cloth 1195 Paper 495 THE relationship between technology and the liberal ideals of freedom and equality may be viewed in two quite different ways According to the more optimistic view technology is simply an instrument of power whose proper use insures the material abundance required to achieve a fully liberal society The other view asserts that technology threatens liberal ideals in two ways by encouraging the belief that human beings are elements in a system of production and may be used as any other thing would be to increase economic output or maximize social welfare with total disregard for any claims to equal treatment and by limiting personal freedom through the proliferation of large bureaucratic organizations over which the members themselves have little control In EnglishSpeaking Justice a dense and provocative though loosely argued book George Parkin Grant defends this second view and attempts to show why some widely discussed arguments in support of contemporary liberalism fail to meet the challenge that technology poses for freedom and equality Mr Grant is a Canadian and though well known in his own country he has received less attention in this one That is to be regretted Mr Grants views are refreshingly unclassifiable in familiar political categories and he moves from philosophical to current political issues with intelligence and dexterity The publication of EnglishSpeaking Justice in an American edition will help bring him the wider audience he deserves The claim that modern technology is an antiliberal force that threatens the dignity of the individual is hardly original What distinguishes Mr Grants book is his stronger claim that liberal political theory as it is currently practiced in the Englishspeaking world provides no ground for the traditional view that human beings possess unique characteristics  the capacity for language and reflective selfunderstanding  that establish their moral status and entitle them to special respect Any conception of social justice presupposes that morality is a consequence of this uniqueness Most Englishspeaking liberals according to Mr Grant assume that justice the fair treatment of individuals in society is our due what we human beings are especially fitted for but they fail to recognize that this assumption derives from our lingering attachment to certain ancient moral beliefs  in particular the belief in an immortal human soul  that modern science demands we abandon Liberal political philosophy according to Mr Grant has proved unable to support these moral beliefs Without such support he argues our commitment to justice remains fragile and subject to subversion by the forces of technology Mr Grants attack on modern liberalism is addressed almost entirely to one particular tradition in liberal theory the social contract tradition whose representatives from Hobbes to John Rawls have all assumed that the liberal conception of justice is most persuasively defended by showing that its basic requirements would be adopted by rationally selfinterested individuals concerned to maximize their own wellbeing endeavoring to establish common rules for their protection and future governance The defect in social contract liberalism according to Mr Grant is that it begins with an inadequate conception of who or what a human person is For a social contract theorist the rules of social life are to be thought of as the product of an agreement negotiated by imaginary persons in some presocial state or condition These imaginary persons Mr Grant argues are nothing more than soulless calculators of their own selfinterest Such a conception of the person he maintains is insufficient to explain our belief in the equal dignity of all human beings if some are better calculators than others why should those whose powers of calculation are underdeveloped for example the retarded and the unborn be accorded the same respect or receive the same benefits as those who possess such powers in abundance This rather abstract question has recently been given practical urgency according to Mr Grant by the Supreme Courts decision in the case of Roe v Wade granting a limited constitutional right to abortion It is impossible Mr Grant argues to adjudicate the moral and legal issues raised by abortion without first deciding what it means to be a person and explaining why persons are entitled to justice as their special due  an explanation he believes social contract liberals are unable to provide Mr Grants book ends with a call to reconcile the claims of justice to the truths of modern science and with a warning that long inattention to this matter in the Englishspeaking world may have enervated our capacity to address it It is true that many contemporary social contract theorists lack an adequate conception of the person and are therefore at a loss to explain why we shouldnt treat the weakest and least developed members of our species in whatever way seems most convenient for the rest One can argue however that John Rawlss version of social contract theory which Mr Grant criticizes in detail is not subject to this criticism Although individuals in Mr Rawlss conception do make their choices on the basis of rational selfinterest alone his description of the imaginary presocial situation in which these choices are made is meant to express the idea that all persons are entitled to equal respect by virtue of their equal capacity to form independent goals life plans and conceptions of the good Unlike intelligence this capacity does not vary from one person to the next Moreover it has a moral relevance that intelligence and other natural qualities lack and is therefore a more reliable foundation on which to rest our liberal conviction that all persons must be treated with equal dignity TO be sure this interpretation of Mr Rawlss social contract theory leaves unanswered the question whether an unborn fetus or any other marginal member of our species should be considered a person with the same entitlements as a competent adult An answer to this question requires a fuller account of the relationship between those qualities that give an individual moral standing as a person and those that establish his membership in the species For such an account even to be thought possible however one must accept the premise that some such relationship does in fact exist a proposition cast in doubt by the German Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant The liberal conception of personhood may indeed be inadequate but before we can have a better one we must close the gap on which Kant insisted so strenuously between our moral and natural selves Under the circumstances there is a great temptation to return to the illiberal wisdom of the ancient Greeks following the path of Nietzsche and Heidegger Despite his considerable admiration for these two thinkers Mr Grants own commitment to liberalism and his respect for the undoubtable core of truth which has come out of technology prevents him from taking a similar turn I think Mr Grants intellectual courage praiseworthy but in his resolution to lighten to turn his back on the darkness which surrounds justice in our era he should draw some hope from the fact that our Englishspeaking liberalism whatever its philosophical defects continues to protect the weak and marginal among us to a remarkable degree
DELAYS IN SELECTING JUDGES SNARL FEDERAL COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/01/us/delays-in-selecting-judges-snarl-federal-courts.html,The Reagan Administrations difficulties in filling 115 judgeships is causing delays and hindering the operation of Federal courts throughout the nation according to senior judges and members of Congress Administration officials said there was a pressing need for new judges but acknowledged that it would be months before a substantial number of nominees could be chosen and sent to the Senate for confirmation Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah urged the Senate Judiciary Committee last week to complete action on pending nominations saying the district courts in his state were overwhelmed The chief judge of the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York Constance Baker Motley wrote to New Yorks two Senators recently expressing urgent concern over the fact that judicial vacancies are not being filled on a timely basis White House Cites Urgent Need Fred F Fielding the White House counsel who heads the Federal Judicial Selection Committee said The need is urgent everywhere there is a vacancy The Administrations choice of judges will have an important impact on the courts The new judges whom President Reagan will nominate in his second term together with the 165 judges he appointed in his first term will represent more than half of all sitting judges in the district and appellate courts when the second Reagan term ends according to most estimates There are a total of 744 Federal judgeships Sheldon Goldman a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has studied the Reagan Administrations effect on the judiciary says Mr Reagans court appointments will be felt well into the next century In the last 50 years Professor Goldman said only Presidents Roosevelt and Eisenhower had the opportunity to appoint so many judges The number of judicial vacancies almost three times the yearly average has resulted from a variety of factors 85 New Judgeships Created In July Congress created 85 new judgeships and the Justice Department said another 40 vacancies arose through retirement death or resignation When Congress created the new lifetime positions last year it directed that no more than 40 of them could be filled before the Presidential inauguration a provision that was intended to save positions for the Democrats to fill in case they regained the White House Some Administration officials and Senate Judiciary Committee aides attribute the delays in selecting judges to the recent change of leadership at the Justice Department while others say Republican senators whose views are sought for nominations to judgeships in their states have moved too slowly in recommending candidates According to Mark T Sheehan a spokesman for the Justice Department which makes recommendations for nominations to the White House only 10 of the vacancies have been filled so far Candidates for another 17 positions were nominated in the last session but were held over and are still awaiting action James M Spears Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Policy which handles the process of screening potential judges said he hoped to have nominations for all the vacancies sent to the Senate by fall For about a third of the openings however Mr Spears says the department has only started collecting names just the first step in a process that takes months Role of Ideology Questioned Critics of the Reagan Administration contend that it is systematically selecting judges who will promote its policies on social issues The Administration denies that it has set any particular requirements but its officials say they are looking for judges who interpret the law rather than enact it Professor Goldman of the University of Massachusetts said ideology was playing a role in the appointments Not since Franklin D Roosevelts first term he said has any other Administration conducted such an ideological screening of judicial appointments to further its policy objectives According to a study Professor Goldman has completed that will be published in the April issue of the magazine Judicature almost all of the judges named so far by Mr Reagan have been Republicans and almost a quarter of them have been millionaires Meanwhile the sheer number of nominees who will appear for confirmation is causing concern among Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee which must vote on them Surprise Democratic Move On Tuesday the ranking Democrat on the committee Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware appeared to confound his Republican colleagues when he unexpectedly invoked a rule allowing him to postpone action on the 17 judicial nominees who had been held over since last session and were scheduled for a vote that day I dont want to be in the position where because of the large number we let someone through who is not qualified Senator Biden said later in a telephone interview Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts expressed concern over the Administrations record on appointing members of minority groups to the Federal bench Only two of the 165 judges named by Mr Reagan have been blacks And Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio questioned whether the Administration would apply an ideological litmus test to evaluate potential candidates in terms of whether or not they conform with the Republican platform Withdrawal of Reagan Nominee Mr Metzenbaum noted that the Administration had withdrawn its own nomination of Deputy Solicitor General Andrew L Frey for a seat on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals after 13 Republican Senators wrote Mr Reagan to say they would oppose him The Republicans opposition derived from Mr Freys support for abortion rights groups and the National Coalition to Ban Handguns as well as his contributions to Democratic candidates challenging Senator Hatch and Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina It would harm the judiciary Mr Metzenbaum said to place ideology above integrity legal experience and judgment in selecting judicial candidates Senator Biden said the Frey case was also causing him concerns that the Administration would increasingly be pressured by the right wing to start employing a rightwing litmus test for judges Until this case Mr Biden said he had seen no evidence that the Administration had sought to put all rightwing lawyers on the bench or had tested candidates ideology in any way that troubled him Looking for LikeMinded Judges In testimony Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d was asked in light of the Frey case whether the Administration would use ideological positions to evaluate judicial candidates I dont believe there should be a litmus test but it may be on occasion that a persons memberships may be signficant in evaluating his qualifications Mr Meese replied Mr Fielding who heads the Administrations selection committee said What the President has asked us to look for are candidates who share his understanding of the proper judicial philosophy that is who view the courts as interpreting the law rather than enacting it He added that if the Administration succeeded in naming as many judges as it now expects presumably well have accomplished a philosophical balancing of the Federal Judiciary  Mr Spears who heads the Justice Departments screening panel similarly said that he was seeking candidates who share the Presidents view that the role of the courts was limited On issues we have no real litmus test he said We will ask them about a case and critique the opinion Im interested in how they critique it Im not looking for a definite outcome but a thought process that reflects the conservative approach

ROBINS SETS UP DALKON SHIELD PAYMENTS FUND,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/03/business/robins-sets-up-dalkon-shield-payments-fund.html,The A H Robins Company a Richmond pharmaceutical concern said yesterday that it had set aside 615 million to settle legal claims from thousands of women who used its Dalkon Shield birth control device The reserve fund is by far the biggest provision of its kind in a product liability case lawyers said Clearly it is the biggest medical device productreserve ever set up said Dale Larson a partner in the law firm of Robins Zelle Larson  Kaplan in Minneapolis which specializes in product liability cases It is also undoubtedly one of the largest product reserves set up in any category Reserve Led to Loss Establishment of the reserve fund caused the company to report a huge loss for its fiscal fourth quarter and for all of 1984 Including the charge Robins reported a net loss of 4616 million for all of 1984 Robins said it had set up the reserve to pay for compensatory damages and legal expenses from current and future lawsuits GER Stiles Robinss chief financial officer said the reserve does not cover possible punitive damages assessed against the company or any possible damages from litigation abroad Given the uncertainties this reserve may not be the amount of the ultimate loss experienced by the company Mr Stiles said He added that the 615 million figure is a reasonable minimum for current and future claims The company said the biggest threat facing it is the prospect of having to pay punitive damages Insofar as compensatory damages go we believe we will be able to handle it Roscoe E Puckett Jr a Robins spokesman said The uncertainty is punitive damages If we are hit with repeated punitive damages it could be a different story Thousands of Suits More than 12000 lawsuits have been filed against the company in this country alleging that the Dalkon Shield an intrauterine birth control device caused infections sterility and spontaneous abortions About 8300 of those claims had been settled by the end of 1984 costing Robins and its insurer 3146 million according to Mr Stiles The reserve does not cover any of those costs The company said it expects a substantial number of new claims to be filed in the future Robins sold about 29 million Dalkon Shields in the United States between 1971 and 1974 when it stopped marketing them following complaints from users and an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration Another 17 million shields were sold in 80 other countries through April 1975 Lawyers said the reserve set aside by Robins comes while issues of product liability are attracting increased attention Consumer activists have hailed the trend toward more and larger productliability claims and awards but companies in many industries say the trend has gone too far Particularly hard hit have been pharmaceutical companies In one recent case Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay 120 million to settle about 700 lawsuits related to its Bendectin a drug designed to quell morning sickness in pregnant women Mr Larson whose firm also has represented plaintiffs in suits against A H Robins said the Robins reserve appears to be bigger than for any other liability claim with the possible exception of the estimated liability of the JohnsManville Corporation which faces thousands of lawsuits alleging charging that the asbestos it produced caused a variety of health problems Manville filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy law in 1982 after it projected that it could face a liability of 2 billion Comments by Judge The litigation against Robins has often been stormy and emotional After a trial in Minneapolis last year a Federal judge Miles Lord accused the company of corporate irresponsibility at its meanest Robins denied the charges and Judge Lord was later rebuked for his comments by an appeals court Last October the company began urging women who were still using the Dalkon Shield to have it removed It also filed a motion in United States District Court in Richmond asking that all punitivedamage cases be consolidated into one class action The court has not ruled on the request An Aid to Company Wall Street analysts said establishment of the reserve should help the company which is otherwise performing well financially to put the Dalkon Shield troubles behind it Theyve created a big fund which is good psychologically said Paul Brooke an analyst at Morgan Stanley The question is whether its big enough Robins said that it had also agreed to establish a 69 million reserve fund to settle securities law claims filed against it in connection with the sale of the Dalkon Shield A classaction suit pending against Robins in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charges that the company and three of its current and past officers had made misleading statements and failed to disclose material information regarding the Dalkon

CARTER URGES PARTY TO OFFER A POLICY MIX,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/03/us/carter-urges-party-to-offer-a-policy-mix.html,Former President Jimmy Carter said today that Democrats should take a lesson from his 1976 Presidential campaign and offer a combination of conservative and liberal policies as they try rebuild the partys political base In my judgment Mr Carter said in response to questions at a breakfast meeting with a group of reporters the Democrats basically should take the position I took in 1976 a combination of approaches some of which could be considered quite conservative and some quite liberal Some of his opponents in the 1976 Presidential contest criticized Mr Carter then a relatively unknown former Governor of Georgia for what they saw as an effort to appeal to both liberal and conservative voters by taking vague positions on controversial issues such as abortion Mr Carter said today that his approach helped him win the Presidency and could work for his party as it tries to halt the erosion of its public support He advised Democrats to commit themselves to such principles as fiscal conservatism Federal deregulation of industry a strong military establishment with inexorable budget increases peaceful resolution of international conflicts protection of civil rights nuclear arms control and strong enforcement of environmental laws Cuomo and Kennedy Mr Carter said he thought Governor Cuomo of New York among others could fill that profile but he repeated his view that the party would be wise not to turn to Senator Edward M Kennedy Jr of Massachusetts as its Presidential nominee in 1988 Last week Mr Kennedy who is viewed as a possible candidate for President in a speech aimed at bringing himself closer to the political center challenged Democrats to lead a country not a collection of divided and contending groups The Senator also said his party must curb its appetite for new Federal spending programs Mr Carter said that despite such remarks Mr Kennedy who unsuccessfully challenged him for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1980 would have diffficulty softening his reputation as the leader of the partys liberal wing I dont think Senator Kennedy would have an easy time taking on the image of that conservative element the former President said Party Comeback Predicted Mr Carter predicted that Democrats would make a comeback from the 1984 election in which President Reagan defeated Walter F Mondale his Democratic challenger in 49 of the 50 states The Democrats are going to do very well in 1986 he said I think theyll take control of the Senate again and I think we have an excellent chance to win in 1988 Obviously an unknown factor is how well Reagan will do in the next four years The former President was in town to promote his new book on the Middle East The Blood of Abraham On that subject Mr Carter said that since Mr Reagan was apparently unwilling to take a personal role in breaking the stalemate in the Middle East peace process he should name a prominent American to try to mediate the dispute Mr Carter suggested either former President Gerald R Ford or former Secretary of State Henry A Kissinger Asked if he would be interested in such an assignment Mr Carter replied I think I am qualified for the role but I dont think its likely President Reagan would ask me

NEW POLITICS EMERGE IN ITALY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/06/opinion/new-politics-emerge-in-italy.html,ROME Italy enjoys a wide audience in America for its fashions and wines Yet has comparable attention been paid to Italys new politics since Washingtons preoccupation in the 1970s with the Eurocommunism fad Will our American friends be prepared to read for example Mays regional and local elections in the light of an electoral trend that stems from a deep transformation in postwar Italian society One sign of change has been the emergence for the first time since World War II of the socalled minor parties  the Republicans and Socialists around which orbit the Liberals and Social Democrats These are intermediate parties between two poles  the Christian Democrats and Communists both mass parties The emergence of the intermediate forces marks a shift from an ideological to a pragmatic approach  a shift being driven by the underlying societal change that has seen a reduction in the electoral strength of the Christian Democrats and Communists This means for American policy makers who tend to devote more attention to other major members of the alliance that in coming years a strengthened Italy is likely to play a more dynamic role in European unity Western defense and Mediterranean stability The decline of the old politics has been especially evident since 1981 The Christian Democrats have held the Prime Ministers office for only eight months under Amintore Fanfani the Republicans for 17 under Giovanni Spadolini now the Defense Minister and the Socialists for 20 under Bettino Craxi In other words for 37 months intermediate parties have headed the Government The new trend emerged after the 1976 parliamentary elections when the intermediate parties won 172 percent of the vote and the Christian Democrats and Communists together 73 percent In the 1979 elections the four parties edged upward to 185 percent the two major parties dropped to 685 percent In 1983 the intermediate parties again rose reaching 233 percent and the two major parties declined to 626 percent Although the Communists rallied a bit in the 1984 elections for the European Parliament a sympathy vote after the death of the party leader Enrico Berlinguer the trend reemerged in municipal elections held afterward To be sure the trend to the intermediate parties was fueled by the multiple crises that came to a head in early 1981 terrorism galloping inflation 22 percent at the time and political immorality chiefly the Italian Watergate scandal of the P2 Masonic lodge with its misdeeds and corruption in high places But the trend also has deep roots in three waves of modernization that have struck Italy since the war First from the late 1950s through the early 60s the countrys economy went from an essentially agricultural to an industrial base introducing fundamental changes in the style of life Second secularization took hold In a nation where the Roman Catholic Church is enormously influential in the 70s divorce and abortion whatever we may think of them became legal after nearly a century of political struggle  decisions confirmed by overwhelming majorities in successive referendums The third wave  movement toward a postindustrial society  was galvanized by the need to solve problems generated by the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1977 One sign of the new times is the increasing maturity of labor unions especially evident in 1984 in the dramatic reduction in hours lost through strikes Of course with several pockets of preindustrial underdevelopment remaining the economic picture is varied Overall the emerging Italy is closer to the rest of Europe and the West as is evident in its headway against the Mafia its steps toward longoverdue tax reform its movement toward constitutional change aimed at streamlining government operations Thus the sooner our American friends change the lenses with which they look at our politics the better for all An understanding of why parties long deemed minor hold the reins and why they are crucial to Italys democratic growth and international position will help avoid misunderstandings and tensions with these growing political forces
LEGISLATORS GIVE FINAL APPROVAL TO STATE BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/06/nyregion/legislators-give-final-approval-to-state-budget.html,At 259 AM today the New York Assembly voted the final bill of the states 39 billion budget a 279page document that provides for a cornucopia of purposes  from a new ambulance for the LaFargeville Fire Department to a new taxcut program Coming five days after the constitutionally mandated deadline of April 1 the budget cuts personalincome taxes while increasing spending for the environment and education giving New York City a larger share of state aid and providing 50 million to build housing for low and moderateincome people across the state Several proposals to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs were deferred until lawmakers return at the end of the month The budget is about 9 percent larger than the 19841985 budget of 356 billion As it usually does the Senate adjourned hours before the other house and after a debate over whether to halt the use of Medicaid funds for abortions Debate on the issue which was proposed in an amendment has become a ritual during the closing hours of budget oratory Wandering the Corridors The Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson left the chamber and paused wearily for a moment as his colleagues spilled around him hurrying for their hotels and apartments and twoweek vacations The budget does for the state what needs to be done said Mr Anderson a Republican from Binghamton Budgets are like snowflakes  no two are alike During the final hours of debate Governor Cuomo a train of aides and his photographer in his wake wandered through the corridors of the Capitols third floor greeting lawmakers elevator operators and aides He stopped here to speak to Assemblywoman Toni Rettaliata a Huntington Republican there to shake the hands of two sergeantsatarms Happy Easter the Governor told Mrs Rettaliata Good budget The photographer took their picture Visiting Old Haunts Mr Cuomo dropped in to see Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink of Brooklyn while the Governors counsel Gerald C Crotty dipped into the Speakers candy jar outside the office Mr Crotty paused to say that an effort to restructure a section of the states bankingtax law had failed but that everybody would try again when lawmakers returned Then the Governor drifted over to the Senate chamber stopping first to ask one of the sergeantsatarms Can I see the old office meaning the chambers of the Lieutenant Governor where he once sat Ooooh he said not unlike a tourist walking into an anteroom flush with the glow of mahogany wainscoting This is all new In his old office the Governor stooped to feel the carpet This is the room where I was attacked by a bat he said As he made for his own office a floor below the Governor was greeted by Senator Anderson and the minority leader Manfred Ohrenstein a Manhattan Democrat Mr Cuomo could not resist tweaking them over the tortuous legislative process One of the prerogatives of the executive he joked is I can go home before you It was 108 AM We Gained a Lot There was as Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer noted during the last hours of the debate something for everyone in the budget Buffalo and Albany received money to build sports stadiums The New York City Opera got 25000 The West Nyack Library received money to fix the roof And the town of Malone 11 miles south of the Canadian border where unemployment is high is to get a new prison and with it hundreds of jobs Weve done things in this budget that have never been done said Mr Kremer a Long Beach LI Democrat who heads the Assembly Ways and Means Committee Theres a lot to be proud of What did we lose in this delay I like to think we lost nothing We gained a lot Democrats from Manhattan in both houses wove legislative language designed to keep the states share of costs for the Westway project at 10 percent into a 712page document called the Capital Projects Budget Other language established strict accounting standards to monitor the costs of Westway and another section of the measure prohibits the Cuomo administration from creating a public authority to manage the project Pleased by the Budget Administration officials have urged Mr Cuomo to veto the language but Eric Lane counsel to Mr Ohrenstein said the language was devised to put Westway under the Legislatures overall fiscaloversight responsibilities In the end Mr Fink seemed to be fighting the lateness of the hour as much the growing raucousness of his members But as he looked back over the three days of voting Mr Fink expressed pleasure at what had been wrought Some people scoffed at the idea that there was something for everyone the Speaker said I never did We have a budget that does something for all segments of our people We added a lot of programs a lot of new positions to state agencies This is not a budget that squeezed a stone dry When the last amendment was defeated on a straight partyline vote and the last bill voted Mr Fink leaning over the Speakers podium hefted a sheaf of papers in his hand and hollered over the din I have a stack of resolutions in my hand he boomed Applause and laughter filled the chamber as Mr Fink shouted the resolutions are passed The Assembly is adjourned he declared
"Wrong Way to Reject a Judge Rejecting the advice of New York's Senators, the Reagan Administration has refused to nominate Will Hellerstein, a highly regarded lawyer, to a Federal judgeship. Though this violates custom, it is the President's prerogative. But the case was handled so crudely that it raises questions about the Administration's hidden agenda.",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/06/opinion/wrong-way-reject-judge-rejecting-advice-new-york-s-senators-reagan.html,The Senates power to advise and consent on judges has produced a selection system in which senators of the Presidents party recommend appointees in their states Unless utterly repugnant to the bar or Justice Department they are usually accepted New Yorks senators share this nomination power  equally when both are of the Presidents party or when not on a 3to1 ratio favoring the senator of the Presidents party More than a year ago Senator DAmato a Republican honored that bargain by submitting Senator Moynihans choice of Mr Hellerstein a well known lawyer for the Legal Aid Society But the Justice Department sat on it without explanation Not until last week did an official remark to an interviewer that Mr Hellerstein though completely qualified would not be nominated His views were said to be inconsistent with the Presidents Mr Hellersteins offense may have been some old writings that display a public defenders perspective on prosecutions Though prosecutors now support his nomination he may have appeared too willing to unclog the courts by excusing prostitution or drug possession A President is not bound to honor every senatorial recommendation But why delay a year while the judgeship stood vacant Why whisper the rejection in the press instead of making a forthright statement Nobody will say Nobody questioned the candidate Nobody had the courtesy to tell even Senator dAmato President Reagan vowed last year to appoint only judges that pass a certain philosophical test perhaps including their views on abortion Attorney General Meese denies that abortion or any single issue is his standard He appears to recognize that this would threaten judicial independence and severely limit the quality of future appointees Having drawn close attention to its selection methods however the Administration had best come clean and explain what standards it is applying
FORUM;   'LITMUS TESTS' FOR FEDERAL JUDGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/07/weekinreview/forum-litmus-tests-for-federal-judges.html,Should the political philosophy of judges be considered in making appointments to the Federal bench Some Senate Democrats have said no and criticized what they see as Republican efforts to insure that only conservative judges are selected In one case the White House withdrew a District Court nominee after 13 Republican senators said they would oppose him He had supported abortion rights and guncontrol groups Then the White House angered Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan by deciding not to appoint his candidate to Federal District Court in Manhattan The judge was rejected because the Administration thought he was too liberal Mr Moynihan said In a third case three Republican senators acknowledged that they sent a questionnaire to a nominee for Federal District Court in New Jersey asking him about his views on various social issues Leslie Maitland Werner a reporter in The Timess Washington bureau asked Senator Howard M Metzenbaum an Ohio Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and James M Spears the Acting Assistant Attorney General who supervises the selection of Federal judges to discuss the dispute METZENBAUM FAR RIGHT IS STARTING TO USE MUSCLE QUESTION Should judicial candidates political or ideological views be examined in assessing their fitness to serve on the Federal bench Answer Ideally probably they shouldnt but realistically they are My concerns relate to the fact that in one instance three senators and in another 13 deemed it appropriate to develop a litmus test for nominees the President had already nominated I think its appropriate to inquire into the general thinking of an individual but totally inappropriate for a senator to set up a litmus test based on one or more issues These people are asking nominees to indicate in advance how they will interpret the Constitution and court decisions Q Then you agree with Sandra Day OConnors stand at her Supreme Court confirmation hearings She said I do not believe that as a nominee I can tell you how I might vote on a particular issue which may come before the Court or endorse or criticize specific Supreme Court decisions presenting issues which may well come before the Court again To do so would mean that I have prejudged the matter or have morally committed myself to a certain position A I think shes right on target To answer such questions would destroy the impartiality of the jurist when a case comes up in the future Each case must stand on its own fact situation and even with the same facts a jurist could be persuaded to make a distinction based on some legal ground or might be compelled to abide by the precedents If a jurist had prior to considering a case answered such a question regarding the issue it might possibly be sufficient basis for an attorney to ask for the jurist to disqualify himself or herself Q Could the senators who sent the questionnaire have asked the same things at a confirmation hearing A It would also be inappropriate for them to ask the same questions in a hearing but I couldnt stop them The problem is that when its in writing there are no other senators to move into the debate and object when it goes too far and the candidate cant object to the committee chairman I never saw anything like this That questionnaire was demeaning insulting Q Havent all Administrations sought judges who might be expected to share the views of the President A All Presidents take into account the politics and the political philosophy of their nominees But if you look back at the Carter appointments or many others by other Presidents there was less of this ideological commitment demanded in advance of each appointee Q So you do not think for example that former President Carter sought judges who shared his views A I dont think so They were looking for more blacks Hispanics and women and they were effective But that does not necessarily imply getting more liberals than conservatives because theres no correlation Q The Democratic leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee Joseph R Biden Jr says that the judges appointed in the first Reagan term were qualified and did not generally represent the far right He also says that conservative senators not the White House have been responsible for injecting ideology Whats your view A I dont know if my information is complete enough to evaluate the firstterm judges On the second point the senators have been far more ideologically involved at least from a public standpoint I cant address myself to the White House because its actions are not public But we may be seeing an escalation of this whole issue since the reelection of the President and since Ed Meese has become Attorney General The far right is starting to use its muscle and demanding its due and the President now seems more susceptible to following their lead If I see continued evidence along this line I will not hesitate to tie up the balance of the nominees but Id be very sorry to have to do that If the only way to keep the right wing in check is to fight fire with fire Ill just have to do it SPEARS WE DONT GET INTO POLITICS QUESTION Is there is an appropriate role for politics in the judicial selection process A I never really thought about it We dont get into political questions activities associations or views We dont test candidates by ideology or use a litmus test Thats not our function and I dont think ideological testing would give you the information you need to make a recommendation Courts are not forums for political debate We need to know how the individual will approach his role as a judge A persons political orientations or beliefs may be indicative of judicial philosophy but its not the sole indicator Q What do you seek in terms of judicial philosophy A The President is looking for candidates who understand that the judiciary is one of three branches  its role is limited Its up to the Congress to pass the law to the executive to enforce the law and the judges role is basically to make sure those jobs are done within the parameters set forth in the Constitution The two other factors we examine are experience and intellectual capacity Q Could you describe the process that is involved in selecting a nominee for the bench A The first step is gathering names  from the Hill from state officials from state bar presidents professional people from academia We call people who know potential candidates or are familiar with their work We ask the candidates in for interviews at the Department prepare evaluations and meet with the Attorney General to review the qualifications of the candidates Then we sit down with the judicial selection committee at the White House Once weve reached a consensus then we start the Federal Bureau of Investigation field investigation and the American Bar Association starts its own evaluative process Once we have the results of the FBI investigation theyre reviewed again by the Attorney General Then a formal recommendation is made to the President Q Do you think it is appropriate for senators to ask candidates detailed questions about their views on political issues A Thats the Senates prerogative and Im not going to offer criticism of what the Senate does I think those who evaluate these candidates have a right to ask the questions they need to determine a candidates judicial philosophy Im more interested in thought process Answers are less important than how a candidate gets to that answer We feel confident about a candidates philosophy once he leaves our system Q So if a group of senators advises the White House that they oppose a candidate for political or ideological reasons how should the Administration react A When the senators express concerns about a candidate well listen and consider them If additional work on our part is needed well do it But were going to be looking at the same things we were looking at originally When those nominees are sent up theyre sent up to be confirmed not to be rethought Constitutionally the senators are there to confirm or not confirm  its not a collaborative process Q Three conservative senators recently sent a questionnaire to the Presidents nominee for the Federal District Court in New Jersey Whats your view on asking candidates to assess Supreme Court opinions A I havent seen that questionnaire and cant comment on it On Supreme Court decisions those are litmus test kinds of questions and I dont ask them In interviews with candidates we will ask them to critique the courts opinion in a given case Im not looking for a definite outcome but a thought process that reflects the conservative approach
LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/07/nyregion/l-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-148096.html,ANOTHER VIEW OF ADOPTED CHILDREN While I agree with Philip B Linker Yesterday Your Daughter Had An Abortion Opinion Page March 17 that sex education should be part of school curriculum I am appalled by his statements about adoption In his mind abortion adoption and raising a child alone are all equally uninviting and equally unsatisfactory The girl has to worry about her childs future and the adopted child may later be seriously troubled about the identity of his or her natural parents It is obvious that Mr Linker has never known any adoptive parents or adopted children He might come to a meeting of the Adoptive Parents Committee here on Long Island and meet some of these loving adoptive parents who have spent years seeking a child to love and raise One could not find a group more dedicated to the wellbeing of their children Studies of adopted children have not shown them seriously troubled but often more wanted more appreciated and as much loved as birth children There are happy and successful adopted people in every area of life two of them have been United States Presidents As I wait for news of my adopted baby I think constantly about the girl who will give birth I am sorry for what she has suffered but I admire her great courage and her love for this child How dare anyone call her decision unsatisfactory LINDA MULREAN Greenlawn

CONGRESS HAS ITS WAYS OF INFLUENCING FOREIGN AID;   A $14.5 BILLION PACKAGE WAS ADOPTED BY COMMITTEE LAST WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/07/weekinreview/congress-has-its-ways-influencing-foreign-aid-14.5-billion-package-was-adopted.html,The House Foreign Affairs Committee decided last week that an aid program for the Upper Huallaga Valley in Peru could go forward only after the Agency for International Development determined that the valley had reduced the cultivation of coca leaf the raw material for cocaine Aid to Paraguay said the panel would be halted until a good faith effort had been made to determine the whereabouts of Josef Mengele a Nazi doctor reported to be hiding out in that country Jordan could not purchase sophisticated American weaponry under the bill until the President certified that Amman was publicly committed to the recognition of Israel and ready to enter peace negotiations These are only three of the dozens of clauses conditions and constraints contained in the 121page 145 billion foreign aid bill adopted by the committee They are another demonstration of Congresss determination to influence foreign policy For many members debate over the annual aid bill provides the only opportunity to voice their feelings about foreign policy We feel this is our one chance to express our views on a number of issues said Representative Howard L Berman a California Democrat who sits on the Foreign Affairs panel Some people would accuse us of micromanagement but that stems from our frustration This is the only vehicle on which we can do anything Otherwise its all talk The growing tendency of Congress to encumber foreign aid bills with all sorts of restrictions and provisos has caused the legislation to stall in recent years No authorization bill has become law since 1981 leaving the foreign aid program to be financed through catchall spending bills known as continuing resolutions Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said he was encouraged by the spirit of comity that marked his committees drafting sessions on the foreign aid bill last week He expressed some optimism that this year the bill would go through But it still has problems There is a danger that we get too detailed warned Senator Daniel J Evans a Washington Republican As a fundamental policy we ought to be working on the major thrusts of foreign policy Sometimes we spend too much time and effort on micromanaging the aid program The State Department generally shares this criticism of Congressional interest in the details of policymaking But the Administration itself demonstrated last week how foreign aid remains one of the most useful tools of international diplomacy When President Gaafar alNimeiry of the Sudan visited the White House early in the week the best present President Reagan could give him was the announcement that the Administration was freeing up 67 million in aid earmarked for his country The money had been blocked pending reforms in the Sudans financial structure Later in the week Mr Reagan cheered Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey by promising to fight for high levels of aid to his country Congressional activism on foreign aid reflects the fact that more and more Senators and Representatives want to have a say increasingly younger members are unwilling to bide their time and defer to their elders One hundred senators all have foreign policy interests now noted Senator Lugar and they feel they ought to play a role The foreign policy committees have also attracted lawmakers with strongly held views on particular issues For example a number of Jewish members sought places on the House panel in part because of a deep interest in Israel Since joining the committee this year Representative Christopher H Smith a New Jersey Republican has concentrated on pressing his antiabortion views Moreover the political balance that has prevailed in Washington since 1981 with the Democrats controlling the House and the Republicans in charge of the Senate and the White House has increased the determination of Democrats to use the foreign aid bill to influence Government actions Democrats here dont feel that we have enough ability to quietly convince the Administration of our concerns said Representative Berman So this becomes our vehicle In the view of Representative Howard Wolpe a Michigan Democrat many lawmakers have been moved to activism by what they regard as the misjudgments of Reagan Administration foreign policy What youre seeing he said is a breakdown of consensus and a low degree of trust between the Administration and Congressional foreign policy makers This assessment seemed to be borne out in a number of provisions adopted by the House committee including the following  An additional 15 billion in economic aid for Israel in the current fiscal year In the process the panel brushed aside an Administration request for a delay  A requirement that aid to El Salvador be contingent on a report by the President detailing that countrys progress toward ending violations of human rights The Administration wanted no reporting requirement and the Senate committee did not include one  A clause making military aid to Guatemala contingent on the installation of a democratic government  An allocation of 5 million in military aid to noncommunist rebels in Cambodia fighting the occupying forces of Vietnam The Administration opposed the provision but Representative Stephen J Solarz a Brooklyn Democrat said the fight illuminated the lack of Congressional confidence in the White House If the Administration reflected the majority of the views on the committee said Mr Solarz the author of the Cambodian aid clause there would be no need to put these things in the bill
"SPAIN IN THE MAINSTREAM: KAFKA, DISCOS, COCAINE",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/world/spain-in-the-mainstream-kafka-discos-cocaine.html,There is still the blood of bullfights the sultry swishing skirts of flamenco the shuffle of old women in black going daily to mass But as Spain tries to assess the political and economic effects of joining the European Economic Community as agreed in Brussels late last month a dramatic social transformation is drawing the country closer to the rest of Western Europe The popular Spanish images depicted by writers such as Ernest Hemingway and George Orwell have not disappeared But over the last two decades and particularly since the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 Spaniards have been casting off nearly four centuries of isolationism It is spectacular how a very different Spain has been created Juan Pablo Fusi an historian at the University of Salamanca said in an interview You can see the changes from one day to the next Few countries have had such a rapid change of such intensity Street Scene Changes The changes can be seen in the streets Middleclass women and shop assistants wear chic French fashions Teen agers sport spiked and brilliantly colored coiffures equal to the best of the London punks The venerable Spanish bar with tapas such as marinated octopus and blood sausages to pick on has been closing down to make way for mushrooming hamburger franchises and a popular chain called VIPS where the latest rock albums and movie videos are served up along with Italian pastas Once a quiet city Madrid the capital is reputed today to have more discoth eques than any other city in Europe And Spanish rock musicians aided by slick new rock magazines have come into their own as composers and players In a small town in the south of Andalusia Miguel Guerrero a 27yearold pianist in a local rock group told a traveler I feel more European than Andalusian a reflection not only of how the changes have permeated the country but also how being modern and being European are equated among youths Divorce Is Legalized A virtual revolution has taken place in sexual mores Pedro Ruiz a popular actor recently advertised condoms on the staterun national television The advertisement provoked a dispute and were withdrawn but it was a far cry from a decade ago when Mr Ruizs former wife was evicted from a pharmacy he said for even asking for condoms because they were socially frowned on Divorce was legalized in 1980 and the Parliament approved a law permitting abortions in limited cases two years ago though the measures constitutionality is being contested Topless bathing on the nations crowded beaches is now common as it has long been in much of the rest of the Europe A side product has also been an increase in prostitution pornography and cabarets featuring transvestites Spains first clinic for sex changes opened here last year Spaniards are divided over what many see as a drop in morals but almost all welcome a parallel explosion in high culture Plays by Samuel Beckett Franz Kafka and Werner Fassbinder are featured in Madrids theaters as Spaniards try to catch up with 20thcentury European drama much of which was banned under Franco An international film festival just ended a Russian art exhibition will soon open and a long series of concerts is celebrating the Year of European Music Ten years ago I would be alone when I went to a painting gallery Matias Blanco an interior decorator said Now galleries are filled Spaniards are reading more seeing more and tastes have improved Dark Side of Change The changes have a dark side Crime much of it related to drugs is up as cocaine has become popular among the middle class heroin addicts litter major cities such as Bilbao and Barcelona and many youths smoke chocolate or hashish Spain geographically isolated from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees began to pull into itself in the early 1500s The country resisted the Reformation and other movements that swept the continent Franco backed by a strongly conservative Roman Catholic Church continued to emphasize that Spain was different and morally superior But Spaniards began to change socially in the 1960s as an extended economic boom brought industrialization and higher living standards The population went from being mostly rural to one in which roughly threequarters of the almost 37 million people today live in cities Madrid has nearly four million people and Barcelona has three million The death of Franco meant the end of censorship but new ideas had already been infiltrating with the waves of European tourists coming here mostly from West Germany Sweden and Britain Tone Is More Secular According to a recent poll by the Catholic Church 30 percent of Spaniards still regularly attend mass among the highest percentages in Europe But church leaders concede attendance has been slowly dropping and a 1978 Constitution ending the official status of the church limited its political and social influence The Socialist Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez elected in 1982 today sets the more secular tone for the new Spain The average age of the Cabinet ministers is just 43 and many of them lived or studied abroad For a Spaniard Europe was liberty Europe was democracy Europe was a model to imitate Manuel Marin the Secretary of State for European Community Affairs said in an interview Social scientists say that perhaps the most profound change has been a displayed sense of political moderation since Francos death An attempted coup in 1981 failed and today the far right and the far left together hold less than 10 percent of the vote according to polls There is an admirable sense of pragmatism and compromise to get things right Ian Gibson an Irish writer on Spanish culture said Spaniards are finally even laughing about the civil war A current comedy film hit The Small Cow ends with matadors from opposite sides

health care and helps his business at the same time Dr L Sam Musallam keeps his Oklahoma City office open until 9 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays he says so the mothers dont miss work and the kids dont miss school His waiting room is comfortably furnished like a living room he says adding People are doctorshopping You just have to compete Doctors facing what is increasingly described as a glut of physicians are marketing their services as never before In the most noticeable aspect of this trend some have even brought their offices to their patients opening freestanding clinics in suburban shopping malls These clinics virtually unheard of 10 years ago are booming Experts say family physicians obstetricians pediatricians and internists the doctors people turn to first when they need health care have had to try a variety of new approaches to keep up Only a few years ago the medical profession considered marketing unethical The American Medical Associations canons barred most advertising and many practices that are now considered a convenience for patients like the use of credit cards were frowned upon But in 1975 the Federal Trade Commission ruled that the associations rules against advertising were too restrictive a decision that was ultimately upheld by the Federal courts Today more and more doctors are advertising their services and using other ways to get and keep patients tactics that are even being taught in many medical schools now There are 500000 physicians in this country said Stephen W Brown president of the American Marketing Association who is a professor of marketing at Arizona State University A majority are viewing marketing as of growing importance and some view it as a necessity About four or five years ago it was very controversial said Mr Brown an adviser to the American Academy of Family Physicians for two years A few groups even asked if I could keep the word marketing out of my title It used to be equated with usedcar salesmen But in fact Mr Brown said there has always been marketing of physicians It used to be called bedside manner or a pleasant office environment  he said All are marketing Dr Allan H Bruckheim director of the residency program that trains family physicians at St Marys Hospital in Hoboken NJ says the changes in the way doctors market their services are a response to patients demands We can no longer have the autocratic chauvinistic and paternalistic doctor that was common until a decade ago Dr Bruckheim said Its not good enough to say You have this disease Ill cure you or Ill cut it out  Todays patients question their treatment Dr Bruckheim said and doctors who want to cultivate their practices will answer them Dr Bruckheim said techniques of developing a practice are now a standard part of the medical curriculum and are taught in programs offered by professional groups like the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians Marketing is not a dirty word Dr Bruckheim said Attention Pays Off Dr Musallam says the attention he now pays to his patients has helped expand his sevenyearold Oklahoma City practice I get a whole lot fewer requests to send my patients charts to someone else he said Scheduling two or three patients for the same time period a oncecommon practice is becoming increasingly rare Dr Morley said This isnt an airline  you cant just overbook Dr Morley said Of course on an airline if you get bumped they give you free passage Why not give the patient a free session if he has to wait more than say an hour or so He said he would not advocate such a policy in every case lest a physician return from an emergency call to face a waiting room full of patients demanding free care But on occasion such a gesture becomes a pretty good marketing tool said Dr Morley who with Mr Brown is writing a book on marketing for physicians Competition Increases Competition from the rising number of new physicians has increased as more and more potential patients bypass the oldstyle family physician when they need medical care turning instead to overthecounter treatments or a variety of new forms of healthcare delivery like health maintenance organizations ambulatory surgical centers and convenience clinics These clinics generally open seven days a week 12 to 16 hours a day treat such maladies as sprains and colds and do not normally require appointments The National Association for Ambulatory Care a clinic trade group says there are 2300 such centers today It expects 1200 more to open by years end Such clinics were virtually nonexistent before 1975 Their fees are roughly comparable to the cost of a visit to a doctors office and are considerably lower than the charges of hospital emergency rooms But the explosive growth of these clinics has led to questions about the standard of care they offer Most of them are run by doctors who are keenly attuned to marketing The majority of states now view them as just another form of private practice and few have established special licensing requirements for them Many of the early clinics called themselves emergency centers leading some in the medical profession to fear they were raising unrealistic expectations among patients who sought treatment at them If somebody says Oh I have chest pains Ill go to the emergency center you had darn well better be prepared to handle that said Chris A Gentile director of the Connecticut Office of Emergency Medical Services Regulations Eyed for Clinics His department has proposed regulating centers that say they can handle emergencies to insure that they have adequate staff and equipment Such an approach was endorsed by the AMA in 1983 Connecticut like many other states has not customarily imposed special regulations on care provided outside of hospitals Faced with surgical clinics psychiatric clinics abortion clinics family counseling clinics eye clinics and more Were looking at whether we need to amend our regulations or take a new regulatory approach said Stanley K Peck director of the Connecticut Division of Medical Quality Assurance Florida Georgia Ohio and Rhode Island have also moved to regulate facilities that advertise themselves as emergency centers according to separate surveys by the American Medical Association and the National Association for Ambulatory Care Like Connecticut these states are generally trying to make sure such centers meet certain requirements in staff training and equipment But it is too soon to know what the effects of these regulatory efforts will be Voluntary Standards Are Set Meanwhile the clinic trade organization has just established a voluntary accreditation program The idea said Anne Stafstrom a spokesman for the group is to give the clinics credibility and make them not as likely to be regulated by state agencies So far three have been accredited Doctors are wary of criticizing the concept of convenience clinics Dr John J Coury Jr chairman of the AMA board of trustees noted that many association members especially younger ones are on the staffs of such centers Mr Brown said competitive pressures were driving many young doctors to work for the clinics Five to 10 years ago a new physician could just put out a shingle and they were flocked with patients Mr Brown said Ive had physicians come up to me and say Steve Ive been in practice for six months and Im seeing three and a half patients a day Thats pretty sobering Dr Coury said the association had no objection to the clinics as long as their standards of treatment are high and patients are able to develop continuing relationships with physicians in them William R DeLay spokesman for the 57000member American Academy of Family Physicians expressed a similar opinion but he sounded a cautionary note If it says it offers continuous comprehensive care which is the hallmark of the family doctor it should do so Todays Family Doctor Mr DeLay complained about an advertising campaign by the nations largest chain of such centers Med First owned by Humana Inc Advertisements refer to Med First as todays family doctor We take issue with that said Mr DeLay who asserted that many clinics make no effort to establish a longterm doctorpatient relationship They should offer more than just episodic care he said Susan E Miller a Med First spokesman said its 114 centers do offer continuity If there is one doctor you prefer out of the two or three at the center you can have that doctor as your private physician she said You can make appointments to see him The centers she said emphasize convenience and quality of care Mr DeLay acknowledged that concern for the quality of care does not apply only to the new clinics He added There is no reason that a physician cannot change his approach to the patient and still remain a fine physician
Senator Moynihan and the Children,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/opinion/senator-moynihan-and-the-children.html,On the left the Democrats buzz about how their party must reinvent itself rightward On the right Republicans puff about the need to hack more from social welfare programs Who speaks for the center on issues of profound national concern No one until last night In the first of three Harvard lectures Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York offers up an issue of substance that could unify not only Democrats but also liberals and conservatives In an act of intellectual and political leadership he invites Americans of all persuasions to address the afflictions of the family and of the most putupon victims the children For all the scorn spat out by critics at social engineering America has scored a dramatic social triumph largely eliminating one whole facet of poverty  among the elderly The bad news as the Senator says is that this leaves the contrasting condition of youth all the more striking About 3 percent of our elderly are poor but among preschool children the figure is 18 percent Two of every five Americans living in poverty are children Though the rates are even worse for black and Hispanic children this is not a racial issue It may have seemed so in 1965 when Senator Moynihan wrote  and suffered relentless abuse for  his famous report on the Negro Family Today this is an issue affecting the American family What to do Repeatedly remedial efforts have been found to do zero good Analysts like Charles Murray author of Losing Ground argue that the programs may even have increased the poverty Senator Moynihan sees no evidence for that but hes not much interested now in philosophical debate Losing ground He urges Americans to concentrate on common ground The family agendas of right and left do not coincide Some conservatives ask scornfully Why so much liberal concern for illegitimate children but so little for unborn babies Some liberals reply with similar scorn Why so much concern for fetuses early in pregnancy but so little for the death rate among infants early in life Furthermore the common ground may be too big to stand on together Senator Moynihan acknowledges the point by Gilbert Steiner of the Brookings Institution that family welfare means too many conflicting things to too many conflicting groups ever to permit political action Yet the Senator makes an impressive constructive contribution by outlining familychild issues on which conservatives and liberals might readily agree B Reenlarge personal and dependent tax exemptions These were once large enough to push people out of poverty but have not nearly kept pace with inflation Had they been indexed in 1948 the figure now would be 2500 each instead of 1090 Larger exemptions is something on which all sides did agree as recently as 1948 B Index welfare aid for children In the last 20 years all Federal entitlement programs  for veterans for the aged the disabled the retired  have been indexed against price inflation All except one the entitlements of children B Establish a national benefit standard for child welfare aid Such aid continues to be administered by the states with wide variation in benefits A national benefit level would help millions Thats far from a liberal proposition The Republicans endorsed it in their 1972 platform B Identify and support programs that work Some programs have in fact saved millions of people and probably dollars as well One is Head Start the earlychildhood enrichment program Another is Supported Work which has successfully led welfare recipients into regular jobs B Protect children and their children from teenage pregnancy and abortion Education and other public programs could be constructive The causes of the increases in illegitimacy singleparent families and other profound changes in the family are not well understood Nor is it clear that initiatives like these would triumph over deep social forces But they can deflect those forces they can help children they can strengthen families and they are politically practical That is Senator Moynihans message and it deserves to be heard right and left far and wide
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS PRESS FOR THE OUSTER OF A. I. D. CHIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/10/world/conservative-groups-press-for-the-ouster-of-a-i-d-chief.html,Conservative groups have called for the resignation of M Peter McPherson administrator of the Agency for International Development following a stormy meeting with him last week At the meeting the groups criticized AID policies in Mozambique and El Salvador as well as the agencys 36 million contribution to a United Nations fund for population control Paul M Weyrich director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said in an interview today that nearly 30 conservative groups had joined his call for Mr McPhersons ouster Mr Weyrich said he went into the meeting last Thursday with an opinion of Mr McPherson that was basically neutral By the meetings end I turned to him and I told him he was a disgrace Mr Weyrich recalled Mozambique Aid Under Fire He said that Mr McPherson had asked to address the meeting of about 40 conservative leaders Mr McPherson was on a trip to Asia today and could not be reached for comment an agency spokesman said AID a Federal agency that works in conjunction with the State Department supplies aid to developing nations Participants said the meeting grew raucous when Mr McPherson discussed Reagan Administration plans to give about 37 million in aid to the Marxist Government of Mozambique which has been hit by drought Members of the audience charged that AID was supporting an antiAmerican Government near collapse According to some questioners Mr McPherson came under heavy criticism when he implied that he was only carrying out Administration policy on Mozambique aid not creating it We know that he plays a role in developing the policy said Sam Dickens of the American Security Council Offended Official Says Carl Olson an official of the Conservative Caucus was at the meeting and said he was offended that AID would aid Mozambique without pushing for any movement toward restoring their Government to freedom The caucus a lobbying group has also called for Mr McPhersons resignation Mr Olson said that Mr McPherson thought he was going to come into that meeting and charm everybody and say he was doing a good job but it doesnt look like the facts are with him Mr McPherson came under fire again during the meeting when he criticized members of Congress who have urged the United States to halt financing of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which promotes family planning in China and other third world countries where there have been reports of forced abortions and sterilization Violation of Law Charged The group charged in a recent letter to President Reagan that AID was violating a law passed in Congress last year prohibiting support for the fund until it ends its activities in countries that promote coercive population control According to Mr Weyrich Mr McPherson told the meeting that the members of Congress did not understand the law and that the aid was proper At that moment Mr Weyrich said he turned to Mr McPherson and told him You are unfit to hold office He said Mr McPhersons answers to other questions at the meeting had been inaccurate and fumbling Mr McPherson he said was trying to undercut Reagan Administration foreign policy
WOMEN'S HEALTH: BOSTON COLLECTIVE REFLECTS ON GAINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/11/garden/women-s-health-boston-collective-reflects-on-gains.html,BOSTON THE year was 1969 A group of young Boston women were beginning to get together to exchange names of doctors and information about health care Information was hard to come by  the age of the selfhelp book had not yet dawned  so each woman would pick a topic such as childbirth rape or abortion do her own research and write a paper From those meetings the Boston Womens Health Book Collective was born and from those papers their bestselling book Our Bodies Ourselves evolved Today the collective still operates out of an office in a church basement but it has come a long way since its underground beginnings as a radical advocate of womens rights in health care They called us the crazy womens health movement said Judy Norsigian one of the collectives 13 original members But some of its crazy ideas  such as advocating that information about risks be supplied with birth control pills or that women have an alternative to the traditional hospital setting for childbirth  have become widely accepted in the 1980s Moreover with the publication of its latest book The New Our Bodies Ourselves in February the collective has found television stations across the country readily offering its members a forum to spread their message to an even larger audience According to Simon  Schuster the publisher which says it is doing a major promotion for this expanded and rewritten edition more than 125000 copies have already been sold and the book is in its second printing The original Our Bodies Ourselves which has been attacked as being pornographic by the Moral Majority and other conservative groups has sold close to 3 million copies and been translated into 12 languages Its royalties finance an annual budget of C12 C1 more than 100000 for a variety of health care programs for women We really started the trend of trying to demystify medicine said Norma Swenson who at the age of 53 is the oldest of the collectives original members they still meet almost weekly at each others homes in the Boston area My generation of women was brought up totally captive of medical authority she said You just didnt ask questions But the collective began with the assumption that not only could we ask questions but we would and we should That was a breakthrough and it made our book the groundbreaking phenomenon that it was Mrs Swenson was sitting in the collectives headquarters in an Armenian church in Watertown just outside Boston next to Mrs Norsigian who at the age of 37 is the youngest of the original members The room was filled with shelves of books on womens issues and file cabinets crammed with research materials The phone rang constantly with women calling for advice about medical problems Mrs Norsigian and Mrs Swenson described the collectives latest book as a fouryear project that required the work of 90 women It includes expanded chapters on such topics as sexuality pregnancy childbirth abortion and sexually transmitted diseases as well as chapters on topics not covered in the original book such as new reproductive technologies alcohol and smoking violence against women and environmental and occupational health The underlying message is still the same women can and should be active informed participants in their own health care And the criticism of the medical establishment is just as strong The relationship between a woman and her doctor the book says is usually one of profound inequality on every level an exaggeration of the power imbalance inherent in almost all malefemale relationships in our society Doctors still come up with the most paternalistic condescending and sexist attitudes toward women said Mrs Norsigian who is a Radcliffe graduate There is a basic problem with the infantalizing of women with the belittling of them and not sharing information adequately The fact that there are more women in medicine doesnt mean that things are changing she added It has made some difference but not every woman doctor is a feminist Since the book was a group effort not everyone who worked on it agreed with everything that went into it Conflicts were resolved by including more than one point of view The psychotherapy chapter is a good example said Mrs Swenson who has a masters degree in public health from Harvard The book has a lot of positive things about psychotherapy but there are also a lot of negative things It was a compromise Although a group approach to writing a book has its drawbacks Mrs Norsigian said the women would not want to work any other way The collective was formed in the early days of the womens movement when there was a lot of emphasis on creating nonhierarchical organizations where each womans voice would be heard she said Its worked well for us As we compare ourselves to other womens organizations particularly nonprofit public interest groups we realize we have a lot more stability and much better working relationships With its publishing royalties the collective operates a womens health information center that answers inquiries from across the country Other projects include distributing free copies of the Spanishlanguage edition of Our Bodies Ourselves to clinics and farm workers lobbying to have tampon manufacturers establish new safety and labeling standards and a health education project for women in Massachusetts prisons Its not that things have so dramatically improved for women Mrs Swenson said but theyd be much worse if it were not for the pressure of the womens health movement We are a presence now that cannot be made to disappear Womens voices are being heard speaking about their needs and their experiences and they are not going along with having decisions based simply on what the medical profession needs or what the drug industry needs I find that enormously exciting It simply didnt happen 15 years ago GETTING INFORMATION ON WOMENS HEALTH CARE THE Boston Womens Health Book Collective handles hundreds of inquiries each month from across the country about womens health problems They ask anything and everything said Norma Swenson a member of the original collective A woman was going to the dentist and was seven months pregnant Her husband was panicky about the drugs she was going to have so he called to say Can you tell me about this  Inquiries are answered with copies of research materials from the collectives files We ask people to send in a few dollars for photocopying said Judy Norsigian another original member If they are local we encourage them to come in and do their own research If they are not we copy the articles and mail them The collectives address is 465 Mount Auburn Street Watertown Mass 02172 The telephone 617924 0271 is answered Tuesday through Friday between 10 AM and 4 PM Eastern time
BUCHANAN TAKES ON AN INFLUENTIAL ROLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/11/us/buchanan-takes-on-an-influential-role-in-the-white-house.html,As the new White House director of communications Patrick J Buchanan the conservative columnist and author has become one of the most powerful policymaking figures in the Administration Mr Buchanan has played a major role on a number of issues The list includes the construction of 21 additional MX missiles and approval of the Administrations budget as well as President Reagans veto of legislation to provide emergency farm credit In addition he has worked to build legislative and public support for aid to Nicaraguan rebels On the White House staff second to Don Regan Buchanans the most important guy around said one key White House official Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff who appointed Mr Buchanan to his job on Feb 5 remarked here today I like the guy Hes feisty hes Irish hes articulate and has strong opinions Hes played it very sensibly Mr Regan who is in Santa Barbara while the President spends a weeks vacation at his nearby ranch is in almost daily contact with Mr Buchanan at the White House on what Presidential strategy should be in the next few weeks A former speechwriter for Presidents Nixon and Ford the 46yearold Mr Buchanan has served in recent years as a television commentator and syndicated columnist In those posts he took strong conservative positions on topics as diverse as arms control abortion American liberalism and East Coast newspapers especially The New York Times and The Washington Post two favorite targets Mr Buchanan a 1962 graduate of the Columbia University School of Journalism has also been an editorial writer for The St Louis GlobeDemocrat According to financial disclosure reports Mr Buchanan earned about 400000 in 1984 as a commentator His White House post pays just over 75000 a year Mr Buchanans increased influence at the White House is measured by the powerful roles he has already assumed as well as Mr Regans plans for him in the next few months Mr Buchanan oversees all White House speeches and is responsible in large measure for Mr Reagans remarks calling Nicaraguan rebels the moral equal of our Founding Fathers our brothers and freedom fighters More Aggressive Oratory These speeches on Central America and other topics reflect a shift in oratory from the toneddown approach of Mr Reagans first term Then speeches were under the control of such relative moderates as James A Baker 3d the former chief of staff and now Treasury Secretary Richard G Darman Mr Bakers chief aide and David R Gergen Mr Buchanans predecessor Beyond his speechwriting role Mr Buchanan won his first major battle for authority last month by gaining control of the Office of Public Liaison The office with more than 36 employees is responsible for building support on specific issues among minorities women business executives and various interest groups Mr Buchanan prevailed over Edward J Rollins Mr Regans political assistant a popular figure in the White House A ranking White House official said here today that Mr Buchanan was also expected to assume some of the authority held by Michael K Deaver the deputy chief of staff who is to leave the Administration in May The official said Mr Buchanan would be involved in planning in how to posture the President Mr Buchanan despite his title of director of communications has declined to speak to White House reporters or to appear on television to articulate the Administrations case Plays Very Well With Regan In not having a public role Pat has increased his private influence considerably said one Republican legislative strategist What hes decided to do is to go the inside route rather than the public route It plays very well with Regan and the President Regan is relying on him for much more than communications strategy but also for overall strategy over the next four years Roger Stone a Republican political consultant close to White House officials said Pats influence is expanding because he plays well by the new rules Keep your head down do your job have a passion for anonymity Anthony R Dolan the chief White House speechwriter who works for Mr Buchanan said Hes one of those people who are without the demons that inhabit the psyches of highlevel Washington people Theres a total absence of nervous insecurity He never worries about A talking to B Hes extremely efficient You send in an idea and you get an answer in a day Hes calm I think Regan likes that On one level the key role of Mr Buchanan who declined to be interviewed is underscored by some of the positions he has advocated in recent weeks Advice on Vetoing Farm Aid Before Mr Reagan vetoed emergency farm aid calling it a massive new bailout Mr Buchanan made the following argument according to one White House aide Dont stall Take a position be precise veto the bill say why be strong dont waver The aide added From a communications point of view it worked better than we thought We took the action we had a minimum of political fallout However one official said Mr Buchanan had argued in vain against reductions in Mr Reagans proposed increase in military spending an amount that was reduced last week in a compromise with Senate Republicans from 6 percent to 3 percent on top of an increase to make up for inflation Within the White House one official said Mr Buchanan also argued initially for a straight upanddown vote in Congress on aid to the contras as the Nicaraguan rebels are known and not the peace offer that Mr Reagan made in an attempt to win Congressional release of 14 million in aid for Nicaraguan rebels Pushed for Televised Speech At the same time Mr Buchanan has pressed for a nationwide television speech by Mr Reagan on aid to the rebels a proposal that is termed unlikely by one ranking official here It has hardly gone unnoticed that Mr Buchanan is one of the few Regan aides with an office on the first floor of the West Wing steps away from the Oval Office as well as Mr Regans quarters More important Mr Regans style of management demands memorandums from his staff rather than the facetoface meetings common under Mr Baker Pat writes well and Don is a reader one official said They play into each other very well Some of Mr Buchanans strong views though voiced before his White House job began have stirred criticism and a fear of potential embarrassment for the White House Positions as Columnist Recently the World Jewish Congress and Representative Robert G Torricelli Democrat of New Jersey accused Mr Buchanan of favoring the abolition of a Justice Department office in charge of tracking down Nazi war criminals in this country In a syndicated column Mr Buchanan criticized the Office of Special Investigations for accepting Sovietsupplied evidence in proceedings against accused war criminals Rusty Brashear a White House spokesman said Mr Buchanan as a columnist had strong opinions on numerous subjects but that any decision on the future of the agency would be made by the President and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d Even some Republicans who are critical of Mr Buchanans statements in the past  he has called doctors who perform abortions butchers and has labeled the womens movement feminist idiocy  are impressed with his emergence in the White House He has a knowledge of how White Houses work said one former White House official His reputation or the perception of him as a forceful character has helped him In Washington perception is often more important than reality Ken Khachigian a speechwriter for President Reagan in his first term urged Mr Regan to appoint Mr Buchanan Pat had been in the White House before he was skilled in the art of communications he had very good ties to all the Reaganites and I had a feeling that perhaps there ought to be a more activist aggressive effort at presenting the Presidents views Mr Khachigian said Every President needs all the help he can in order to get his views across
AROUND THE WORLD;   Spanish Court Rejects Limited Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/12/world/around-the-world-spanish-court-rejects-limited-abortion-law.html,Spains constitutional court today rejected a law that the Socialistdominated Parliament enacted 17 months ago permitting abortion in limited circumstances The law had not been put into effect awaiting a court ruling Justice Minister Fernando Ledesma argued later that the section dealing with ethical abortion could be considered to be in effect because the 12 member courts ruling did not specifically mention rape The law would have permitted abortion in case of danger to the mothers life if the fetus was malformed or when pregnancy resulted from rape The penalty for a person who performs an abortion and for a woman who obtains one is six years in prison Conservative political parties appealed to the court after the law was enacted by Parliament in October 1983

KEAN'S TOXIC WASTE RECORD BECOMES DEMOCRATS' TARGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/12/nyregion/kean-s-toxic-waste-record-becomes-democrats-target.html,The Kean administrations record on toxicwaste cleanup emerged Wednesday night as a key campaign target for the five Democratic candidates for governor as they met in their first televised debate before the June 4 primary Under questioning by reporters for the New Jersey Network the stateoperated television system the candidates repeatedly charged that Governor Kean had not responded vigorously enough to the potential health threats from toxic waste during his first three years in office While there was substantial agreement on most issues raised during the debate which lasted an hour and 45 minutes the candidates took differing positions on what to do with the states 800 million budget surplus and on abortion and the death penalty The candidates are John F Russo of Toms River the Senate majority leader Essex County Executive Peter Shapiro of South Orange former State Senator Stephen B Wiley of Morris Township Mayor Kenneth A Gibson of Newark and Robert J Del Tufo of Morristown a former United States Attorney for New Jersey Major Concern Around State The candidates emphasis on environmental concerns is no surprise Polls taken for the candidates by the state Republican organization and by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University have all identified the states problems with toxicwaste cleanup and solidwaste disposal as the chief concerns of New Jersey residents Governor Kean in his State of the State Message in January declared this to be the year of the environment in New Jersey and announced plans for a 450 million cleanup program The Governor would use the money which is to come from bond revenues and from taxes to upgrade local sewerage systems support resourcerecovery projects and clean up toxic waste with new treatment plants Mr Gibson who described himself as the bestqualified candidate on the environment by virtue of his engineering degree from the Newark College of Engineering said 1985 should not begin the cleanup it should have started three years ago Mr Kean positioned himself on the issue at a time when it appeared that Representative James J Florio Democrat of Camden and the Democratic candidate for governor in 1981 would be a candidate for the nomination again this year However Mr Florio the chief sponsor of the Federal Superfund law for toxicwaste cleanup and his partys strongest candidate on the issue has decided not to run All of the candidates who are scheduled to debate again on May 22 pledged to move swiftly to find sites for hazardous waste treatment facilities a decision that has been hanging fire for more than two years This administration has been treating the problem as if it were a public works program instead of a health emergency Mr Wiley said I would move to clean up waste immediately and argue later about who should pay for the cleanup Assessing the Cleanup Costs Mr Russo the sponsor of the state law that became the model for the Superfund said he disagreed with Mr Keans environmental proposals because they would require taxpayers to pay for the cleanup He said industrial polluters and generators of hazardous materials should be assessed the cleanup costs Mr Kean wants to return part of the anticipated budget surplus to taxpayers in rebate checks something the Democrats called an electionyear gimmick to help Mr Kean win reelection Mr Russo said he would roll back the 1982 sales tax increase that helped create the surplus Mr Wiley would use some of it for toxicwaste cleanup Mr Gibson to improve the states water supply system and Mr Del Tufo would apply some toward waste cleanup and retain some for a rainy day fund for state emergencies Mr Shapiro said that the surplus could reach 1 billion and that it should be used to reduce the property tax burden which he said was the third highest in the nation He said the state could do this by taking over local welfare and court costs and paying a greater share of public education Role of Organized Crime Mr Del Tufo also said that while the state was cleaning up waste it must also crack down on organized crime which he said was generating much of the problem through illegal dumping of wastes which threatens water supplies in some areas On the question of abortion Mr Shapiro Mr Wiley and Mr Gibson said that it should remain a matter between a woman and her doctor and that they would veto an antiabortion bill if a Federal law were enacted giving states the right to pass such measures Mr Russo and Mr Del Tufo said they were personally opposed to abortion and would sign an antiabortion or prochoice bill if either passed the Legislature Mr Russo the sponsor of the states new death penalty law was the only candidate who supported capital punishment The others said they were philosophically opposed to it but would implement the law if elected
MAN IN THE NEWS;   SENATOR WHO AIMS HIGH: EDWIN JACOB GARN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/13/us/man-in-the-news-senator-who-aims-high-edwin-jacob-garn.html,When Jake Garn goes after something he bears down so hard he has been known to talk about a goal even in his sleep More often than not he gets what he wants and his colleagues in Congress were not surprised when the senior Senator from Utah finally snared the space shuttle ride he had long been angling for Determination alone could not have put Senator Garn in orbit but he had both the political acumen and the power of the purse to win As chairman of the subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that oversees spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration his influence on the space agency is pervasive particularly at this time when NASA wants money for a permanently manned space station Senator Garn startled NASA officials on May 12 1981 with his opening remark at a hearing of his subcommittee My first question he said is when do I get to go on the space shuttle In the years that followed he continued to nudge NASA once asserting that a Senator had an obligation to kick the tires of a project as expensive as the shuttle just as he had testflown the B1 bomber prototype and testdriven a new Army battle tank Finally on Nov 7 1984 NASA announced that the Senator had accepted an invitation to join six other crew members on the 16th shuttle mission thus becoming the first incumbent member of Congress to fly in space Few Government officials have better technical qualifications for space flight than Senator Garn and jogging table tennis and other sports have kept him in good physical condition Although his duties aboard the shuttle will not include piloting the 52yearold former Navy pilot is at home in aircraft cockpits From 1956 to 1960 he flew lowaltitude antisubmarine patrols over the waters bordering China Korea and the Soviet Union At one time Senator Garn intended to make a career as a naval officer but after marrying Hazel Thompson and starting a family in 1957 he had second thoughts In 1960 he left the Navy and went into the insurance business in Salt Lake City Argument Leads to Politics Edwin Jacob Garn was born Oct 12 1932 to a Mormon family in Richfield Utah Early on he became active in various community organizations including the Utah Air National Guard in which he holds the rank of colonel retired Senator Garn recalled that while serving in the National Guard he once got into an argument with a Salt Lake City Commissioner who suggested he run for office if he did not like the way the city did things Mr Garn took the advice to heart He won election as a Salt Lake City Commissioner in 1967 and became Mayor in 1971 He also gained a reputation as an untiring foe of Federal bureaucracy which he sometimes called a dictatorship Mr Garn his wife and their four children went to Washington in 1974 after he easily won a seat in the United States Senate In 1976 Hazel Garn was killed in an automobile accident the next year Mr Garn married Kathleen Brewerton Bingham the mother of one son The couple have two children of their own Conservative InfluenceSenator Garn has become one of the most powerful conservatives in the Republican Party As a member and later chairman of the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee his influence has been felt at the Chrysler Corporation he initially opposed the 15 billion Federal loan guarantee in 1980 that saved the company throughout the banking industry he was a principal promoter of bank deregulation and in New York City he voted against Federal funds for New York noting that as Mayor of Salt Lake City he had earned only about 1000 a year more than a New York City garbage collector Senator Garn has opposed Federal financing of abortion the proposed equal rights amendment many social welfare and labor reform programs approval of the Panama Canal Treaty and the second strategic arms limitation treaty He has fought effectively for increased military spending the MX missile and President Reagans proposed spacebased system to defend against nuclear missiles A defensive system that subtantially degrades Soviet confidence in its ability to attack successfully the United States and its allies Mr Garn recently wrote will strengthen deterrence and reduce the threat of nuclear war Part of Mr Garns influence in the Senate stems from the careful study he devotes to complex issues Jake has recognized that in the Senate knowledge is power because so many senators are spread so thin on so many issues one of his aides said Some critics have described Senator Garns space trip as a political attentiongetter noting that he must stand for reelection in 1986 But the Senator undismayed encouraged news coverage of his preparations and training at the Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston Space agency officials said Senator Garn volunteered to be the subject of space sickness studies And the Senator noted Ive logged more hours as a pilot than most astronauts
CHURCH WITH DEEP ROOTS IN COMMUNITY CONFRONTS CHANGES IN ITS CONGREGATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/13/nyregion/church-with-deep-roots-in-community-confronts-changes-in-its-congregation.html,Deirdre Cahill wore iridescent lavender eye shadow a shockingpink sweatshirt a black leather jacket and three earrings in each ear In the ninth decade of the 20th century there was nothing particularly outrageous about the 13 yearolds getup except that she was wearing it in the halls of the Holy Child Jesus School in Richmond Hill where  from 830 AM until 2 PM  such distractions are prohibited by the principal Sister Mary Joel Deirdre is a devout girl who gets breathless when she talks of her impending confirmation She was breaking no rules by shedding her parochial school uniform after hours when she is a volunteer at confraternity classes  religious instruction for publicschool children Still Deirdre blushed at the admission that she had rushed home from school to change and to preen before the mirror choosing not to challenge Sister Mary Joel since the day she got caught and her earrings were confiscated Shes oldfashioned Deirdre said but I know she does it for our own good I used to want to wear normal clothes to school Then I got older and realized Catholic school gives you a good education I think not just because I go here that we have more manners than public school kids They go Can I go to the bathroom We have to say May I please be excused Theyre a lot more smartalecky Deirdre has weighed the rewards and demands of her faith as have many among the 15000 parishioners of Holy Child by far the largest of 27 churches and synagogues in Richmond Hill This Queens neighborhood is chiefly Catholic with 60 percent of its population of Irish German or Italian descent And Holy Child at 11111 86th Avenue is the focus of many lives and some say the anchor that steadies the community There is no doubt in my mind that Holy Child is the hub of Richmond Hill said John Werner a retired banker and a church trustee If anything happened to the church and the school I think thered be a very drastic effect on the whole community Things are happening to the church as it cele brates its 75th anniversary that are typical of the times While the population in the Brooklyn Diocese which comprises Brooklyn and Queens has held at about 14 million in the last decade church attendance has declined by at least 5 percent and Holy Child despite its pervasive hold on Richmond Hill is no exception According to Msgr Raymond S Leonard pastor of the church there are 4000 families on the rolls at Holy Child which represents a slight falling off from when he joined the parish 17 years ago In the same period enrollment at the school has dropped from 1000 to 530 and devout groups such as the Nocturnal Adoration Society have disbanded Attendance at mass has declined to the point where full houses during Holy Week were a cause for celebration although one oldtimer dismissed the unfamiliar attendees as A  P Catholics  you only see them for ashes and palms Not the Same Respect Its probably because we are an authoritarian church and thats weakened on every level said Monsignor Leonard at 71 the oldest of Holy Childs four priests but one known in the parish which is divided in its opinion of him as an innovator With the young people you have a change Its not a disregard for authority but its not the same respect for it We were brought up in a way where we accepted things automatically said Mr Werner the father of 10 but young people feel theres nothing wrong with questioning authority As individuals perhaps theyre more honest than we were They feel comfortable stating their disbeliefs Mr Werners wife Rita who teaches confraternity classes and is active in the South Queens Right to Life Group begs to differ I look at the services she said The young people are there even if they stand closer to the door Monsignor Leonard has urged change on the church but has met resistance Some parishioners objected when he rearranged the seating so the congregation was closer to the altar If youve gone to Holy Child for skatyeight years and this is the pew you like nobodys going to get you down front said Jane McKenna a parish member who was Geraldine A Ferraros neighborhood liaison last year during the former Representatives VicePresidential campaign Others raised their voices and got their way when the monsignor suggested abandoning uniforms for Holy Child students because it segregated them from publicschool children Mothers like them Mrs Werner said And some worry about expensive social activities that could exclude the poor An Evening With Dennis Day in March  with Irish step dancers Irish coffee and Patty Moriarity on the accordion  cost 25 What was wrong with the old days some parishioners asked when Pat Hardiman a neighborhood tenor entertained and tickets were free More unsettling would be an attempt by Monsignor Leonard to close the financially troubled school which includes first to eighth grades Charging an annual family tuition of 700 the school supports the 20000ayear salaries of 18 lay teachers while only three nuns remain in the classroom all from the Sisters of St Joseph I wouldnt be too upset the monsignor said if we turned and used the public schools and moved ourselves meaningfully into the religious education of those children A Docile Classroom Two blocks away in a living room dressed with Holy Child graduation pictures Mr and Mrs Werner responded to the monsignors suggestion with the sort of debate passionate but fairminded that seems to characterize their long union Mrs Werner noted the difference between the confraternity and parochial schoolchildren whom Sister Mary Joel with distinct pride described as very docile At confraternity classes one recent afternoon a volunteer teacher begged her wandering charges most of them chewing gum to settle down and gained their attention only when she mentioned the St Johns University basketball team The way children treat each other and think about things at Holy Child is a more allconsuming attitude Mrs Werner said And even with that discipline it isnt a repressive atmosphere That her husband interjected is the danger Theres such a thing as carrying it too far Political Conflict In an unspoken way a similar dialogue goes on between Sister Mary Joel and Sister Catherine Bernadette a Trinitarian nun who runs the confraternity classes and a program for retarded children and serves the neighborhoods poor It was Sister Catherine who approved Deirdre Cahills afterschool costume and elected recently not to report a misbehaving confraternity child His parents are so strict Sister Catherine said that if I called them hed be meat in a sandwich In the midst of the 1984 Presidential campaign when Jane McKenna quit going to Rosary Society meetings because she tired of the abortionrelated criticism of Mrs Ferraro Sister Catherine privately expressed support for the VicePresidential candidate an attitude she traced to experiences at Catholic University in Washington where she earned a doctoral degree Youre exposed to more than prayer Sister Catherine said and have a different attitude when you come back The nun said the university had urged its sisters to dissuade women seeking an abortion But if a woman persisted Sister Catherine said we were told to tell her where to go and I dont think Geraldine meant any more than that That position is overwhelmingly unpopular in the parish although only a handful of people join Mrs Werner at monthly Right to Life meetings I have told Gerry I regretted not being able to vote for her Mrs Werner said And I know to many people especially young women she represented the fulfillment of a dream She wasnt your dream girl Mr Werner said Offering my daughter a way to do away with a baby his wife replied is not the fulfillment of the American dream Neither the Werners agree is the parishs failure to fully absorb the recent Hispanic arrivals in Richmond Hill who account for 22 percent of the population There have been individual cases where people have reached out their hands and theres been no real rejection Mr Werner said but theres a consciousness we should be doing more Monsignor Leonard and Sister Mary Joel said they did not know how many Hispanic people attended Holy Child or its school but both agreed the numbers were low When the Rev Joseph P Keane Holy Childs only Spanishspeaking priest gave a bilingual homily at a confraternity communion Mrs Werner said the response was positive Were hoping that they might start a Spanish mass she said Language is a barrier Monsignor Leonard agreed He also noted that I have no doubt about their faith but theyre not quite as practiced in obligations The Irish and Germans  they must go to mass on Sunday The Latin temperament is a little freer Prejudice and Compassion Sister Catherine observed that Richmond Hill is a changing neighborhood and people dont want to talk about that But at the same time she commended the parish for its attitude toward the poor Sister Mary Joel indicated a similar contradiction when discussing racial attitudes among her pupils They emptied their mothers cupboards the principal said for the starving Ethiopians Yet several years ago a crossing guard complained that Holy Child students were harassing blacks from Richmond Hill High School Our children Sister Mary Joel said sadly showed prejudice For the principal running the school is a battle against modern social conditions Increasingly for example there are students whose parents are divorced If the mother is living with another man Sister Mary Joel said you dont want them condemning her but you still have to teach the principles of our faith Deirdre Cahills parents are separated so she now walks six blocks to school instead of nipping across the street That has not dimmed her enthusiasm for her education at Holy Child which will end with a June graduation Besides the ordinary endofthe year celebrations Deirdre will have a private ceremony in Sister Mary Joels office I have her earrings in the drawer here the principal said And I told her when she graduates she can have them back
Books of The Times ;   Uphill Battles,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/13/books/books-of-the-times-uphill-battles.html,REASONS TO LIVE By Amy Hempel 129 pages Alfred A Knopf 1195 The test of a firstrate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function wrote F Scott Fitzgerald One should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise This is a view of life shared by nearly every character in Amy Hempels astringent new collection of short stories Scarred by love and loss attuned to natural disaster both the geological sort like earthquakes and floods and the more personal variety and given to feeling overwhelmed by the intractable facts of daily life these people nonetheless keep searching for reasons to live They are too wise too damaged or maybe just too skeptical to hold out for anything so luminous as hope or faith What they want simply is something  a sign a person a perspective a joke  that will help alleviate the pain enable them to continue to go on to the next day Most of them try to function by thinking up ways to make the time pass They enter sweepstakes which as one character points out are less risky than contests which actually require the exercise of certain intelligence knit sweaters watch dumb television shows and teach their pets stupid tricks In the story titled In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson Is Buried a terminally ill woman asks a friend to entertain her with things I wont mind forgetting And her friend the narrator complies I told her insects fly through rain missing every drop never getting wet I told her no one in America owned a tape recorder before Bing Crosby did I told her the shape of the moon is like a banana  you see it looking full youre seeing it endon The two women also talk about how Tammy Wynette really changed her tune how she now sings Stand By Your Friends  and they tell each other sick jokes about seeingeye dogs going blind Making jokes for Miss Hempels characters is one way of coping with life and even though their humors often defensive  a way of mocking themselves as well as others  their laughter can also be redemptive Miss Hempels own tart tingly wit meshes incongruously but neatly like a wellcut jigsawpuzzle piece with her gift for empathy and her pointed sense of the grotesque the body at the bottom of the scenic overlook point the blood stain on the freshly vacuumed rug the late arrival of flowers sent by someone who has died Held together in the nubbly matrix of the authors narrow conversational prose these qualities announce not only the presence of a sharply defined sensiblitity but also that rarer thing  a distinctive and finely tuned literary voice There are moments when that voice falters Such slighter stories as The Man in Bogota Celia Is Back and When Its Human Instead of When Its Dog are no more than odd contrived fragments of overheard dinnertable conversation  awkwardly and unprofitably stretched out into narratives And Miss Hempels efforts to evoke a particular kind of California malaise its symptoms include thinking about earthquakes and faultlines and driving the highways aimlessly at night can sound like dull tinny echoes of Joan Didion For Miss Hempel as for Miss Didion the tacky ahistorical landscape of Southern California with its parking garages fake Spanish colonial condominiums and fastfood joints provides the perfect backdrop for her characters alienated lives We live the beach life says a character in Tonight Is a Favor to Holly and by that she means not the life with sunscreen and resort wear but the easy buoyant life of living by the ocean  sitting around languorously in the sun waiting for something  anything  to happen Some of Miss Hempels people are caraccident victims some are recovering from abortions or the death of someone they loved most however are suffering from a more insidious spiritual affliction that makes them feel boring and inert Everyone she knows says one narrator falls into one of two categories those who are going under and those who arent moving ahead About the one thing that these characters do seem to do  and with great frequency  is move from apartment to apartment town to town but this changing of places only accentuates their feelings of disconnectedness Because they are disaffected these people feel like doing nothing and because they do nothing they feel even more disaffected It is to say the least a very vicious circle In the end though each of them does find some reason to go on if not to climb out of their despair Sometimes its a question of tricking themselves into not feeling scared one woman to get to sleep after her husbands death takes to sleeping in his bed so that the empty bed I look at is my own Others try to find substitutes placebos for the love or security they lack in their lives they talk to their pets and slip quarters into phony evangelist shrines Like methadone users they get by for the time being with substitutes for what they really need Rather than trivializing their efforts to get by Miss Hempel writes of her characters with charity and understanding Indeed she suggests that even the smallest act the tiniest gesture  knitting a new pattern in a sweater making sure the cat gets water and food it likes even refusing payment for a job undone  can be an act of courage Such acts she implies at least hold the promise of beginning of establishing some connection  and probably that is the most we can do We give what we can says the narrator of Nashville Gone to Ashes and thats as far as the heart can go
FILM VIEW;   'HEIMAT': ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A REVOLUTION IN CINEMA,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/movies/film-view-heimat-another-example-of-a-revolution-in-cinema.html,Last weekend and this New York audiences have been lining up at the Museum of Modern Art to see Edgar Reitzs massive beautifully realized new German film Heimat which in a running time of almost 16 hours chronicles in minute detail the life and times of one small Rhineland village from 1919 to 1982 The film financed mostly by television interests has been shown both on television and in theaters in Germany Its virtually certain to receive some sort of theatrical release in this country before going to television thus following the pattern set by the 1983 American release of Rainer Werner Fassbinders masterly 15 12hour adaptation of Alfred Doblins Berlin Alexanderplatz Ten days ago a lot of television viewers sat through AD the sometimes riotously solemn five part 10hour postCrucifixion biblical epic conceived and written by Vincenzo Labella and Anthony Burgess as a sequel to their 1977 collaboration Jesus of Nazareth directed by Franco Zeffirelli These productions follow the huge critical and popular success of The Jewel in the Crown the 15hour English miniseries adapted from Paul Scotts Raj Quartet presented on public television by Masterpiece Theater Though the best of these marathon movies Brideshead Revisited I Claudius The Barchester Chronicles have been coming from abroad American entrepreneurs have not been snoozing on the sands of Malibu Theyve been getting into the act with The Winds of War seven segments 18 hours Roots eight segments 12 hours Roots  The Second Generation seven segments 14 hours and Shogun five segments 12 hours So far the only film director of a stature comparable to Fassbinder to attempt one of these maximovies is Ingmar Bergman who originally made Scenes From a Marriage to be shown on Swedish television in six episodes of 50 minutes each I missed the original but having seen his theatrical version which he edited down to a superlatively condensed threehour length I can only suspect that the mini series might have been a bit overwrought Something revolutionary is taking place in the narrative cinema That something is possibly comparable to the development of the modern novel by Defoe Richardson and Fielding in the early 18th century when refinements in printing techniques made books available to the general public Until then books were out of economic reach for most people not as any author knows because the writers were greedy and were being overpaid but because the physical production of books was such a slow tedious and expensive process Suddenly with a public ready to read and able to buy a new kind of popular literature evolved Now the Television Age is making possible a new kind of film  the maximovie  one that for both better and worse is bound to effect changes both in cinema esthetics and in our expectation of movies The stillunknown factor in this revolution is the effect of the increasingly ubiquitous home video cassette player which allows the public to rent films as easily as books and for far less money than three or four people would pay to see a movie in a theater A spot check of several Manhattan video stores reveals that although a number of these maximovies or miniseries including both Berlin Alexanderplatz and I Claudius are available on cassettes the demand for them is not overwhelming The same people who will decline dinner party invitations to stay home to watch the latest installment of The Jewel in the Crown are not apparently rushing out to pick up cassettes of those mini series they missed when originally telecast However even if these maximovies still have to prove themselves at the video store their popularity on television has been so established that in time they must affect the narrative cinema as we have come to know it The length of theatrical feature films was never fixed by God but the length weve come to accept has unmistakably determined how theatrical films operate on our senses The limitations imposed on film makers by that length have also prompted them to develop a kind of narrative shorthand that is a part of the cinema art It is more than a little ironic that television whose informationpacked commercials demonstrated that audiences will accept all sorts of ellipses is now demonstrating that they will also accept maximovies like The Jewel in the Crown and Brideshead Running times are relative Any audiences powers of concentration are flexible When Edwin S Porters Great Train Robbery was being prepared for release in 1903 there was some fear that nickelodeon audiences simply would not have the interest or physical stamina to sit still for one feature of this unusual length  11 minutes The Great Train Robbery became a smash a true movie milestone Its audiences not only sat still enchanted by the suspense of this madeinNew Jersey western but they couldnt wait for more which they soon got When D WGriffiths Birth of a Nation had its premiere at the Liberty Theater here on March 3 1915 a New York Times reporter with some awe wrote the next day that it takes a full evening for its unfolding and marks the advent of the twodollar movie The Birth of a Nation actually only takes a little over two and onehalf hours to unfold but for the next 65 years the movies that dared exceed that length were the exceptions and the vast majority were much much shorter Eric von Stroheim composed Greed to have a running time of something like nine hours but when it opened in New York in 1924 the studio moguls using hacksaws had pared it down to something less than three hours In Paris in 1927 Abel Gance tried to get away with a nearly fivehour Napoleon but he too was overwhelmed by his producers who cut it to shreds It wasnt until 1981 that New Yorkers had the opportunity of seeing the Gance masterpiece in something approximating its original form a 240minute version reconstructed by Kevin Brownlow David O Selznick was going against all custom in 1939 when he made Gone With the Wind with a running time of three hours and 42 minutes plus intermission It wasnt whim that dictated movie running times of anywhere from 62 minutes to rarely nearly two hours during the 1930s 40s and into the 50s It was business In those decades the double feature program was the standard mode of presenting films and if those programs ran more than three hours it cut down on the turnover Movie makers didnt necessarily suffer The exhilaration we experience while watching the classics of those years is at least partially the result of their remarkable strictly enforced narrative economy Preston Sturges greatest films never run much more than an hour and a half  The Lady Eve 97 minutes Sullivans Travels 91 minutes and The Palm Beach Story 90 minutes In 1946 David Lean squeezed most of Great Expectations  a candidate for a miniseries or a maximovie if there ever was one  into a most satisfactory 118 minutes In the 1960s movie producers faced with competition from television and the collapse of the double feature system allowed movies to get longer and longer to give the public its moneys worth Most directors and writers didnt know what to do with this freedom though Mr Leans Lawrence of Arabia released in 1962 still seemed comparatively short with a running time of 222 minutes Just how flabby most films  especially comedies  could get when their directors were left to follow their own courses was alltoowell demonstrated that same year with Stanley Kramers 154minute Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World This is a staggering example of inflation when one considers that Buster Keatons General 1927 one of the two or three greatest of film comedies of all time runs just 74 minutes The limitations imposed on film makers in those longgone decades played a major part in how the best directors developed their individual styles To make the kinds of movies he wanted Alfred Hitchcock had to pack every frame of film with information that a later director with more time at his disposal might spread over a series of separate sequences A very particular kind of film language was found However brevity in itself means nothing Artists throughout the ages have allowed themselves to use whatever amount of time they wanted Wagners Ring cycle could not be coherently reduced nor could Eugene ONeills Iceman Cometh Prousts Remembrance of Things Past is not a series of novels Its a lifes work a complete world created from memory and imagination It succeeds through the painstaking accumulation of details that cannot be abbreviated In recent years avantgarde artists in the theater and films have frequently used time as a weapon in their assault on established bourgeois esthetics  and its an intimidating weapon if not always a successful one Most relentless have been Robert Wilson in his theater pieces Einstein on the Beach and HansJurgen Syberberg whose sevenand ahalfhour Our Hitler 1980 left me euphoric However Im not sure whether this was because of the images Id witnessed on the screen and the emotions they evoked or because of the hypnotic state theyd left me in after sitting all that time in one spot watching a minimal spectacle The new maximoviesminiseries are not by the stretch of anybodys imagination avantgarde Their roots are in radio soap operas and the television soaps that followed their chief appeal being that they are unending These soap operas and their slightly more sophisticated primetime onceaweek television spinoffs Dallas Dynasty and Falcon Crest are necessarily shapeless It doesnt make any difference at what point one comes in on their stories or leaves them  they flow on forever stopping not when some particular dramatic point has been reached but only when the ratings drop off The best of the maximovies mini series are something else entirely They do have shape and they have the luxury in which to explore and develop a sense of time place character and narrative in a manner that has not before been available in the theater or films Their manner is not only literary but literary in a leisurely 19thcentury manner This is whats new about them and potentially most exciting Its no accident that the most successful of these series have been based on novels that if not always of the highest literary quality were immensely popular with the public Its no accident too that hardly anybody remembers the names of the people who have written and directed these presentations This is possibly because as in the case of Brideshead I Claudius and The Barchester Chronicles it seems as if the films auteurs were the actual authors which is a kind of compliment to the film makers though not a very flattering one Its also because with the exception of Berlin Alexanderplatz and Scenes from a Marriage the films have not been made with an easily recognizable style What makes the new nearly 16 hour Heimat so invigorating even when one has seen it as I did in two nearly equal mammoth chunks on two succesive days is that here is a gigantic film with a life of its own Heimat is an original It doesnt depend on literary credentials earned earlier Mr Reitz whose other films I dont know is not a director of the striking idiosyncrasies of a Fassbinder or a Bergman but he has succeeded in making an epic film from his own passion and imagination Its also a film that could not possibly fit into a more conventional three or even fourhour format There are times when Heimat does dawdle especially at the beginning However by the time one reaches the second half of the film one is suddenly aware that the early rather plodding lack of cinema sophistication is in fact a reflection of the saga itself which becomes increasingly sophisticated as it goes along Mr Reitzs screenplay written with Peter Steinbach follows the fortunes of the members of one peasantfarmer family from the end of World War I through the days of the Weimar Republic the rise of Hitler World War II the collapse of the Third Reich up to and through the postwar economic miracle Its not a masterpiece but its a monumental achievement in the narrative form of the popular cinema and it immediately identifies Mr Reitz as a formidable new to us director Like a soap opera Heimat which is translated as homeland has its fair share of sudden deaths automobile accidents mysterious disappearances unrequited loves abortions reconciliations and illegitimate births It also has behind it a true artists personal vision which is realized in dozens of memorable performances and scenes that separate art from soap opera By the time it ends its shape is apparent and its effect is invigorating The problem what is the best way to see it Few people have the time or the interest to devote two days of their life to one film Somewhat more feasible is watching it in four four hour chapters one a week for four weeks in the manner in which Berlin Alexanderplatz was shown here theatrically The easiest way is to watch it is in the nowaccepted mini series format on television even though one wont be able to appreciate fully the films technical beauty especially the photography by Gernot Roll By far the most convenient way of course is to watch it at home on your own video cassette recorder going through it at your own speed as you would any very long novel However you do it you wont be disappointed Among other things Heimat could be one of the seminal works in a new cinema form that is not better than the conventional forms were used to just different Because the cinema hasnt really changed that much in the last 50 years thats news
New & Noteworthy,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/books/new-noteworthy.html,STENGEL His Life and Times by Robert W Creamer Dell 895 In the autumn of 1960 when Casey Stengel  who began his baseball

SOME CHARGES DROPPED ON ABORTION BOMBING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/16/us/some-charges-dropped-on-abortion-bombing.html,Federal prosecutors today dropped charges in one of four bombings of abortion facilities last year but each of the four defendants still faces seven counts The Government sought the dismissal because of a change in Federal law on the insanity defense that the defendants plan to use The first attack for which charges were dropped occurred in June when the old law was in effect The later bombings occurred in December and fall under the new law Seven men and seven women were selected today for a panel of 12 jurors and two alternates and opening arguments were scheduled for Tuesday morning The jury is being sequestered for the trial which Federal District Judge Roger Vinson who is presiding expects to take a week to 12 days The defendants are Matthew Goldsby 21 years old and James Simmons 21 both of Cantonment Mr Goldsbys fiancee Kaye Wiggins 18 of Pensacola and Mr Simmonss wife Kathren 18 The new insanity law passed in October shifts the burden of proof to the defense It also requires a showing that the defendants did not know their acts were wrong In a closed hearing Judge Vinson rejected a defense request to dismiss a conspiracy count in connection with the June bombing Judge Vinson also rejected an earlier motion to consolidate three December counts of making bombs into a single count Defense lawyers had contended that since all three bombs were made together there could be only one charge The judge disagreed saying each bomb was a separate unit The four are being tried in connection with the bombings Dec 25 of the offices of the Ladies Center Dr Bo Bagenholm and Dr William Parmenter Dr Parmenter said the attack prompted him to stop doing abortions About 30 demonstrators opposed to abortion picketed outside the courthouse today
COURT TO HEAR PENNSYLVANIA ABORTION APPEAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/16/us/court-to-hear-pennsylvania-abortion-appeal.html,In an action likely to refuel the debate over abortion the Supreme Court today agreed to hear arguments on whether Pennsylvanias Abortion Control Act violates the Constitution The 1982 state law which was substantially invalidated last year by the Federal appeals court in Philadelphia placed an array of obstacles in the path both of women seeking abortions and of doctors who perform them The appeals court struck down many of these provisions on the ground that they represented unacceptable legislative encroachments upon the womans constitutional right The states appeal reached the Supreme Court last fall and the Justices debated in the weekly closed door conferences for several months over whether to hear the case The decision to do so was surprising because the appeal presents issues very similar to those decided in the Courts last abortion ruling less than two years ago In that decision the Court voted 6to 3 that an antiabortion ordinance in Akron Ohio was unconstitutional Todays action raised the prospect that the three dissenters in the Akron case Associate Justices Sandra Day OConnor William H Rehnquist and Byron R White may have new support Outlook on Future Votes The votes of four Justices are required to hear a case Although Chief Justice Warren E Burger was among the 7to2 majority that established the constitutional right to abortion in the Roe v Wade decision 12 years ago he has long been thought to be wavering in commitment to that decision But even if the Chief Justice has changed his views that would still leave the dissenters in a minority None of the five other Justices is likely to switch sides on the issue The action today was surprising also because the Pennsylvania case has serious procedural problems of the sort the Court usually seeks to avoid Before the law ever took effect a group headed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists went to Federal District Court seeking a preliminary injunction against its enforcement They lost and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit That court delayed its ruling until the Supreme Court had decided the Akron case and then applying the Akron decision struck down most of the laws provisions But in doing so the appeals court did not enter a final judgment in the case Rather it vacated the district courts decision and sent the case back to that court for reconsideration A case in that posture would not ordinarily be considered appropriate for Supreme Court review Question of Jurisdiction In its order today granting review in the case the Supreme Court left open the prospect that the procedural problems might prevent a decision Rather than simply noting jurisdiction as it usually does in an appeal the Court said that further consideration of the question of jurisdiction is postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits That was a signal that the Court might not be able to decide the case despite its evident desire to do so However the Court also has before it an appeal by the state of Illinois which had an antiabortion law declared unconstitutional last year by a Federal appeals court If the problems in the Pennsylvania case prove insurmountable the Court retains the option of hearing the Illinois appeal Still another possibility is that the Court took the Pennsylvania case not to decide the issues related to abortion issues but to address whether the appeals court properly handled procedural questions concerning the preliminary injunction In its appeal Thornburgh v American College No 84495 the state challenged that aspect of the appeals courts decision as well as its constitutional analysis of abortion But it is unlikely that the Justices would have engaged in months of debate over whether to decide a narrow technical question of that sort Informed Consent Provision Among the sections of the law that the Court of Appeals struck down was an informed consent provision requiring doctors to provide their patients with certain specific information including descriptions of the fetus a warning that the abortion may have unforeseen and detrimental physical and psychological effects and a list of agencies willing to provide support during pregnancy and childbirth The doctor had to inform the woman that The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania strongly urges you to contact these agencies before making a final decision about abortion The required information was somewhat less graphic than what the Supreme Court condemned as the parade of horribles required by the Akron ordinance In his majority opinion Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr found that the Akron ordinance was impermissibly designed to deter women from exercising their right to abortion
NOMINATION OF A U.S. JUDGE IN JERSEY TANGLED IN DISPUTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/16/nyregion/nomination-of-a-us-judge-in-jersey-tangled-in-dispute.html,Joseph H Rodriguez the New Jersey Public Advocate attended an orientation session for prospective members of the Federal bench in Raleigh NC last week a week before the Senate Judiciary Committee was to consider his nomination It is routine for nominees to the bench to receive such briefings but Mr Rodriguezs nomination has become anything but routine since three conservative Republican Senators sent him a questionnaire asking his views on such issues as abortion school prayer the right to bear arms the proposed equal rights amendment and capital punishment The questionnaire has angered Democrats on the committee and has set off intense lobbying by Governor Kean a Republican and New Jerseys two Democratic Senators to have Mr Rodriguezs nomination released from the Judiciary Committee for a vote by the full Senate The existence of the questionnaire surfaced at a Judiciary Committee meeting earlier this month when Senators Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware and Howard H Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio said conservatives were trying to force nominees to pass an ideological litmus test Questionnaire Defended The questionnaire was sent by Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah Jeremiah Denton of Alabama and John P East of North Carolina Mr Hatch has defended the use of the questionnaire as fair and within the prerogatives of any Senator involved in voting on judicial appointments However the Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina said that he did not want such questionnaires used in the future and that nominees should be questioned only during committee hearings He has scheduled Mr Rodriguezs hearing for Wednesday Gregory C Stevens Mr Keans chief of staff said the Governor had been talking to the White House and to members of the Senate to keep the nomination of Mr Rodriguez on track The Governor is pushing very very hard Mr Stevens said In addition Senators Bill Bradley and Frank R Lautenberg both Democrats of New Jersey have been adding their support to the appointment of Mr Rodriguez a 54yearold lawyer and a Democrat who served as chairman of the State Board of Education from 1972 to 1974 and as chairman of the State Commission of Investigation from 1974 to 1979 A Supporter of Kean Mr Rodriguez who was born in Camden and who now lives in Cherry Hill supported Mr Kean in his 1981 campaign against Representative James J Florio Democrat of Camden Mr Kean won the election by fewer than 1800 votes and subsequently appointed Mr Rodriguez to the post of public advocate At Governor Keans request President Reagan nominated Mr Rodriguez to an opening on the Federal District Court in New Jersey a year ago Mr Rodriguez was given a hearing but the nomination was held up over procedural disputes and died when Congress adjourned At that time two Republican state senators John H Dorsey of Boonton and Dr Gerald Cardinale of Demarest sent letters to Republican Senators in Washington objecting to Mr Rodriguezs confirmation They said he was too liberal and too much of an activist Mr Stevens said he did not believe the letters played any role in the failure of Mr Rodriguezs nomination to win confirmation last year Mr Rodriguez did not return telephone calls to his office on Friday and today although a secretary said he had received them Calls to his home over the weekend went unanswered If he is confirmed Mr Rodriguez would be the first person of Hispanic descent to serve on the Federal bench in New Jersey

ABOUT EDUCATION;FAR RIGHT STEPS UP EFFORT TO CONTROL CLASSROOMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/16/science/about-education-far-right-steps-up-effort-to-control-classrooms.html,IN Hillsboro Mo a parent group recently protested the showing in school of the movie Romeo and Juliet the holding of mock elections and a statemandated sex education course In Cobb County Georgia the school superintendent circulated a memorandum to teachers restricting classroom discussion on several topics including evolution abortion communism religion and something labeled valuing with no further description In West Alexander Pa parents objected to classroom discussion of death and the promotion of critical thinking in the elementary school curriculum These are a few examples of alleged intrusions on school activities reported by People for the American Way a Washingtonbased anticensorship group sponsored by Citizens for Constitutional Concerns Inc The organization has also just published A Consumers Guide to Biology Textbooks available at 1424 16th Street NW Suite 601 Washington DC 20036 A common thread links the examples of interference with school affairs They spring from a littleknown Congressional initiative the Hatch Amendment The first version was attached to the General Education Provisions Act in 1978 by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah It required schools to obtain parental permission before testing pupils psychologically Not much happened until early 1984 when rightwing groups led by Phyllis Schlafly proposed new Department of Education regulations for the acts enforcement In the summer of 1984 Senator Hatch introduced a new amendment to the Education for Economic Security Act prohibiting the use certain Federal funds for any course of instruction the substance of which is secular humanism Secular humanism which first appeared in a footnote to a 1961 Supreme Court ruling unrelated to education appears to have few if any adherents Trying to define secular humanism is like trying to nail JellO to a tree says an official response issued by People for the American Way The group charges that this loosely defined legislation will only serve to increase the harassment of local school districts by the Far Right which uses the phrase to describe anything it doesnt like about public education from the theory of evolution to works by Homer Hawthorne and Hemingway The Education Department held hearings last year but apparently only the regulations conservative supporters were alerted to attend Critics of the regulations which were issued by the Department last November assert that they were so broad that they invited rightwing groups to use them to encourage parents to interfere with a wide variety of school activities ranging from discussion of current events to courses dealing with sex drugs and evolution Earlier this year Mrs Schlafly and the conservative group she founded Eagle Forum which is based in Illinois reported that they had distributed a letter to 250000 parents The letter urged parents to use the Hatch regulations to prevent the schools from manipulating childrens values and moral standards through curricula textbooks audio visual materials or supplementary assignments The letter also asked school districts to seek written parental consent before dealing with a long list of topics far outside Senator Hatchs concern with psychological and psychiatric testing Examples of activities requiring such parental permission are values clarification discussions of situations involving moral issues instruction dealing with nuclear war antinationalistic one world government or globalism curricula dicussion of virtually every aspect of human sexuality autobiographical assignments self evaluation and autocriticism The sample letter which parents are encouraged to address to school boards concludes with an appeal to report violations if necessary to Washington If a voluntary remedy fails it says Federal funds can be withdrawn from those in violation of the law Senator Hatch is unhappy with this interpretation He told reporters through an aide that the amendment was intended to deal only with psychiatric and psychological experimentation and testing and not with classroom instruction He asked for the rule of common sense But new life was breathed into the extended use of the amendment when William J Bennett in his first news conference as Secretary of Education supported greater parental control over the schools If I were a parent with a child in school he said I would take a very close look at what my son was being asked to study because there are a lot of things in schools that in my judgment dont belong there Mr Bennett apparently never intended to support scattershot use of the amendment Soon after his earlier appeal for greater parental watchfulness he called the amendments and the regulations intent much more limited than suggested by rightwing groups Neither Senator Hatchs nor Secretary Bennetts efforts to clarify and limit the effects of the ambiguous legislation has persuaded Mrs Schlaflys allies to retreat They continue for example to challenge any scientific instruction that teaches the idea that man has developed from previous or lower types of living things This in turn has intensified lobbying by a coalition of education and civil liberties groups to repeal the legislation on the ground that it authorizes intolerable Federal intrusion into curriculum and academic freedom Even without Federal sanction few supporters of public education would deny the parents right to keep a watchful eye on their childrens schools That is what local control of the schools by lay citizens boards is all about But to encourage or permit politically or ideologically oriented special interest groups to dictate to the schools censor course content or textbooks rewrite or expurgate scientific theories or limit discussion invites either chaos or totalitarian uniformity The fact that critical thinking appears so regularly on the list of objectionable activities conjures up the danger of a school and a society that is both uncritical and unthinking

3 CONSERVATIVES BACK RODRIGUEZ FOR U.S. BENCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/18/nyregion/3-conservatives-back-rodriguez-for-us-bench.html,Conservative Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee today indicated that they would support the nomination of a Democrat for the Federal bench in New Jersey The three Republicans  Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah Jeremiah Denton of Alabama and John P East of North Carolina  had created a stir by asking the nominee Joseph H Rodriguez the New Jersey Public Advocate to fill out a detailed questionnaire on ideological issues In a hearing today on Mr Rodgriguezs nomination Senator Hatch said he was a little shocked to find the excitement aroused by the questionnaire In it the three Senators asked Mr Rodriguez last month to supply his views on a broad range of social issues including abortion capital punishment school prayer and gun control The questionnaire infuriated Democrats on the committee who described it as an improper attempt to predetermine a judicial candidates potential rulings Questions Called Relevant In replying to the conservatives questions Mr Rodriguez repeatedly referred to the Supreme Courts rulings and noted A district judge is bound by oath to respect the authority of the Supreme Court and its interpretation of the Constitution Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina who is the committee chairman said today that the committee would develop one joint questionnaire and that any Senators who had their own additional questions to ask would have to attend the confirmation hearings to do so In defending the questions in todays session Senator Hatch conceded that some may seem somewhat ideological But he repeatedly insisted that they were all legitimate and relevant Mr Hatch praised Mr Rodriguezs answers to the questionnaire and said he now planned to vote for Mr Rodriguez who was nominated by Governor Kean a Republican and has the support of the states two Democratic Senators In a letter read at the hearing Senator Denton said that Mr Rodriguezs replies to the questions had resolved his concerns and that he would support his confirmation And Mr East in a letter said he too was impressed by Mr Rodriguezs replies to the wholly legitimate questions propounded to him
IN THE NATION;   PURIFYING THE COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/19/opinion/in-the-nation-purifying-the-courts.html,In fiscal year 1983 Federal district courts decided almost 300000 cases and the 12 United States Circuit Courts of Appeal decided more than 31000 The Supreme Court normally hands down fewer than 100 decisions a year Thus even if the longevity of the present nine justices prevents President Reagan from reshaping the Supreme Court in his second term he will still exert enormous power over the course of American law  hence American life  by his lifetime appointments to the lower courts In a forthcoming article for The Nation Herman Schwartz professor of law at American University estimates that by 1988 Mr Reagan may have appointed more Federal judges than any other President  probably about 400 or more than half the 744 active Federal judgeships including 85 created by Congress last year Does this prospect matter Of course it does Mr Schwartz cites an extensive survey of 62 Reagan judicial appointees by Craig Stern of the conservative Center for Judicial Studies to show that these judges have been rather consistently deciding for state authority and against claims under the Civil Rights Act the Education of Handicapped Children Act Social Security Act Sherman Antitrust Act the First Amendment Title VII and by prisoners refugees criminal defendants juveniles etc    Even so is this anything more than the reversal of a trend Since Franklin Roosevelt havent Presidents  even Republicans  been appointing mostly liberal judges so that Mr Reagan is only redressing the balance Reaganite conservatives surely take that view but Mr Schwartz argues that for the most part the widely accepted tradition and practice by which Federal judges are selected has insured a valuable diversity rather than ideological polarization But Mr Reagan seems bent only on a specific kind of judge  in Mr Schwartzs view bright ideologically committed to extreme conservatism and very young The right wing Senator Phil Gramm of Texas for example recently proposed and Mr Reagan nominated Sid Fitzwater 31 years old to a Texas district court Kenneth Starr 34 formerly an assistant to Attorney General William French Smith is one of a number of youthful conservatives named to the appellate bench  in his case the District of Columbia Court of Appeals A study by The Dallas TimesHerald found that 114 percent of Mr Reagans judicial appointees  the highest percentage for any recent President  were under 40 Senator Gramm bluntly stated the obvious reason The added bonus from Mr Fitzwaters appointment he said is that he will be making rulings when Im dead Mr Reagan also has turned down qualified persons for what appear to be ideological reasons  for instance his own Deputy Solicitor General Andrew L Frey a lawandorder advocate rejected for the DC Court of Appeals because he was not opposed to abortion and handgun control William E Hellerstein a respected New York lawyer proposed by the states Democratic Senator Daniel P Moynihan approved by his Republican colleague Alfonse DAmato and endorsed by 24 former Federal prosecutors was turned down  though the Administration had never interviewed him  for a district court appointment He once advocated nonprison sentences for some victimless crimes worse he had incurred the opposition of Roy Cohn All this suggests an ideological litmus test the White House denies that but concedes that it inquires about judgeship candidates views on abortion as promised last year in the Republican platform Three rightwing Senators  Dent of Alabama East of North Carolina and Hatch of Utah  went further they sent a blatantly ideological questionnaire concerning abortion school prayer the Equal Rights Amendment affirmative action etc to Joseph E Rodriguez a former head of the New Jersey state bar who had been proposed for a judgeship by that states Republican Governor Thomas Kean and actually nominated by Mr Reagan At Judiciary Committee hearings on Mr Rodriguez this week the three Senators backed off Congressional sources suggested that one reason was criticism evoked by their witchhunt questionnaire Thats a welcome suggestion that the public may be taking alarm at the idea of an ideologically purified Federal judiciary exerting immense power over American life long after the Reagan Administration becomes a dim memory

CLINIC BOMB TRIAL TOLD OF DISORDERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/us/clinic-bomb-trial-told-of-disorders.html,Three of four young defendents on trial here in the bombings of three abortion clinics suffer severe mental disorders a defense psychiatrist testified today Nancy C Mullen a psychiatrist from California testified in Federal district court that James T Simmons 21 years old his wife Kathren 18 and Matthew J Goldsby 21 were borderline personalities capable of slipping into psychotic behavior A fourth defendent Kaye Wiggins 18 who is Mr Goldsbys fiancee suffered periodic depression but was less troubled than the others the psychiatrist said The four defendants in the sixth day of their trial are charged in the Dec 25 bombings of three Pensacola medical offices where abortions were available Judge Bars Testimony Earlier in the session the defense suffered a setback when Judge Roger Vinson barred the testimony of a social psychiatrist who had said he was prepared to testify on how conflicting social attitudes on abortion could have impaired the judgment of the four defendants Defense attorneys said the testimony of Prof William Brennan of St Louis University was critical to their case The judge ruled that Professor Brennan was not qualified to give opinions on severe mental defects the only condition permitting a defense of insanity under Federal laws that were revised last year It was the latest setback for a defense team that throughout the week was largely unable to make the abortion issue the focus of the trial Attempts to introduce as evidence two comic books Dune and Rex Morgan MD Talks About Your Unborn Child were turned aside by Judge Vinson on the objections of Government prosecutors So too were books by Dr Seuss that defense lawyers two of whom are law professors at Notre Dame University said represented some of the conflicting views on abortion that contributed to their acts The defense made no effort to deny that Mr Goldsby and Mr Simmons plotted and carried out the bombings for the stated purpose of ending what was depicted as the murders of unborn children Nor did they deny that Mrs Simmons and Miss Wiggins had been enlisted to buy explosive powder for the bombs at local gun shops God Called CoConspirator After their arrest in early January both men said that divine inspiration led them to detonate pipe bombs in the three clinics Charges that the defendants blew up another clinic in June were dismissed earlier this week At one point in the crossexamination of a member of the team of United States Treasury Department agents who cracked the case Patrick Monaghan one of the defense attorneys described God as an unindicted coconspirator in the case Mr Monaghan was the chief tactician in the defense effort to portray the defendants as deeply religious and unworldly individuals torn by a conflicting view in American society of the human fetus as a living human being on the one hand and as tissue in a minor medical procedure on the other You will not be asked to condone what happened Mr Monaghan told the jury You will be asked to understand what happened He introduced as evidence a 1982 letter written by President Reagan to a California physician who was active in the antiabortion campaign in which the President expressed horror and sadness over 15 million unborn children quietly destroyed in this nation each year Defendants Look to Reagan Mr Reagans assertion in his letter that something must be done to remove this evil from our society was Mr Monaghan said  a call to action heeded by the young defendants He said the President was a father figure to Mr Goldsby whose parents were divorced when he was a child and Mr Simmons whose father a police officer died of a heart attack in 1982 The defendants sat together during the testimony directly facing the jury of six men and six women smiling and holding hands Character witnesses described them in glowing allAmerican terms but the prosecution drew a picture of four young people plunged into an elaborate secret plot codenamed by the two men the Gideon Project apparently in reference to the Old Testament figure called upon by God to act under the cover of darkness to destroy altars where babies were sacrificed The Government carefully built its case over three days presenting testimony from agents of the Treasury Departments Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau who said they were quickly led to Mr Goldsby by tracing purchases of pipe he made to the construction company where he worked The defense contended that Mrs Simmons and Miss Wiggins were unaware of the plan until a few days before it was carried out Miss Wiggins testified late Friday that she believed the Gideon Project was a river rafting trip planned by the two men Attorneys introduced a letter written to Mr Goldsby on Nov 20 five weeks before the bombing in which Miss Wiggins said Pray for the Gideon Project Pray for the time and the date In her court

NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/nyregion/new-jersey-journal-173503.html,The number of annual abortions in New Jersey is leveling off according to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute a nonprofit organization based in New York City that conducts yearly surveys on abortions nationwide In its latest survey the institute found there was an increase of 1600 abortions in New Jersey in 1982 the last year for which figures are available Officials of the institute said this was a decline from previous years and indicated a new trend Barbara Parks  a spokesman for the institute said that in 1973 the year the United States Supreme Court legalized the procedure there were 10234 abortions reported in the state This increased to 22700 in 1974 and to 61080 in 1982 But the 1600 increase was the smallest since the Supreme Court decision she said Jane Murray  director of communications for the institute said this indicated that the number of women having abortions is not going down  its stable That is a change from the pattern we saw in the early and mid70s when it increased every year State Health Department records show that the typical woman who had an abortion in New Jersey in 1982 was white single and 20 to 24 years old A department spokesman John Polito said 53 percent had had previous abortions
POPE AND JEWISH LEADERS MARK IMPROVED TIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/world/pope-and-jewish-leaders-mark-improved-ties.html,A group of Roman Catholic and Jewish religious leaders this week celebrated the 20th anniversary of a declaration by the Second Vatican Council that revolutionized the relationship between Catholics and Jews Pope John Paul II told the group that the Holocaust which so cruelly decimated the Jewish people was the result of an absence of faith in God and said Catholics and Jews should join together to help restore religious faith The Vatican Council declaration Nostra Aetate or In Our Time in 1965 rejected the once widely held Christian view that the Jewish people were responsible for the death of Christ At the conference the document was repeatedly hailed by both Catholic and Jewish leaders But one prominent Italian Jewish leader strongly criticized the Pope for his recent meeting with leaders of Europes far right In his statement to a conference delegation on Friday the Pope praised the conference for having a specifically theological focus and urged Jews and Christians to help restore a sense of God to a secular world Referring to the catastrophe which so cruelly decimated the Jewish people the Pope said It is precisely an absence of faith in God and as a consequence of love and respect for our fellow men and women which can easily bring about such disasters Let us pray together that it will never happen again he continued urging his listeners to help make people still more aware of the abyss which mankind can fall into when we do not acknowledge other people as brothers and sisters Rabbi Ronald B Sobel senior rabbi at Temple EmanuEl in New York expressed the particular gratification of the Jewish people that the Pope had referred in his annual Easter message to the unparalled inhumanity of Nazi brutality against the Jewish people Together Rabbi Sobel said we share the conviction that bigotry and prejudice born of hatred and nurtured in the failure to respect each others commitments can no longer be tolerated not now not anywhere not at any time The conference was organized by a wide array of groups including the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith in cooperation with the Vaticans Commission for Religious Relations with Judaism Most speakers sought to avoid controversial topics We meet to talk and to build said Nathan Perlmutter national director of the AntiDefamation League But Tulia Zevi the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Community sharply criticized Pope John Paul in a session on Thursday for meeting with a delegation of farright members of the European Parliament on April 10 The delegation included JeanMarie Le Pen the leader of the National Front in France whom Mrs Zevi called that notorious French xenophobe and antiSemite Mrs Zevi said Europe was facing a growing wave of revanchism and racism and attempts to negate the Holocaust She said she wondered whether Pope John XXIII would have have chosen such a time to meet 16 European Parliamentarians of the extreme right The Popes meeting with the far right leaders took many Italian political leaders by surprise and drew reproaches from centrist Italian politicians like Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini The Vaticans spokesman denied a statement by Mr Le Pen that the Pope had offered the group encouragement in their fight against abortion and against moral decadence in Europe Vatican officials also sought to minimize the importance of the meeting by saying it was only one encounter in the course of a general audience that involved many groups One Vatican official said privately that the Pope had not intended to express any support for Mr Le Pens movement or the other farright groups and several Vatican officials said the Pope was not fully aware of the meeting before it took place Mr Le Pen has been criticized by Frances Roman Catholic Bishops
LONG ISLAND OPINION;   SHE'S NOBODY'S STEREOTYPE NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/nyregion/long-island-opinion-she-s-nobody-s-stereotype-now.html,THERES an unpleasant little story that makes the cocktail party circuit from time to time It concerns the suburban matron who boasts that she chauffeurs her child everywhere But cant he walk queries a city friend Yes the mother replies but thank God he doesnt have to Although our first reaction to this anecdote is to conjure up a picture of a blobby youngster too lazy to move and too spoiled to want to the true butt of the joke is the mother We can deduce that shes overprotective but also that shes readily available because she has no life of her own She is of course the typical suburban woman And weve heard more about this cartoon creature She scurries about all day searching for a purpose to her meaningless life having separated herself from civilization when she crossed the county line and spends idle hours in mindless shopping Should I say that since the early 1950s when my husband and I packed up our babies and our furniture and made the move I have never encountered this woman Shall I tell my three grown daughters that the ladies who lunch only exist in New Yorker cartoons Not so Im sure this aimless wanderer lives in our milieu To say however that she is typical of the millions of females who live in the suburbs is comparable to saying that all city women are bag ladies or dwell in penthouses on Sutton Place Unfortunately the stereotype that is the suburban woman has been culled out of what others have chosen to find amusing and exploitable Comedians target her as an ongoing source off material Since we moved to the boonies my wifes joined everything from the Girl Scouts to the Ku Klux Klan Sociologists take her apart and examine the pieces as though she were a malfunctioning clothes dryer Even the sleaze houses on 42d Street have adopted her Motel Afternoons in Steamy Suburbia Although the sin of provincialism is often attributed to women in the outback it seems to me that this very trait is most obvious in those who point the finger How exactly do they think we run our little oneclass society out here in the hinterlands If all of the females in the burbs move no farther each day than the bridge table who teaches in our schools operates our factories and staffs our businesses For years Ive watched the very structure that is so subject to satire pull women together in small towns in a way that couldnt happen in a metropolis Theres no greater leveler than a cause When the 100yearold oak tree on Main Street is threatened with removal or there are rumors of radioactive material in a dump near the school the concerns touch all women I think the little bits and pieces that go together to make all of our lives into some kind of livable mosaic are closer to women in the suburbs Things arent so readily available to us and often we achieve them by the effort of working together In the city I can simply walk up to Lincoln Center and purchase a concert ticket for any night Out here we plan and cajole for months to bring a worldclass artist to our town but in the process I may meet a female carpenter and our assemblywoman both of whom are also music lovers The woman around the corner may not agree with me about abortion but at least when we two go to a town meeting were in a position to confront each other head on I understand something about the suburban stereotype because I knew long ago that it wouldnt work for me The Welcome Wagon lady grimaced when I told here I expected to maintain my life pretty much as it had been before I became a homeowner I did however cast a curious eye at my small daughters and wondered about their future What would become of them  suburban children with a mother who didnt conform Eventually the eldest was dispatched to kindergarten and there among the crayons and balloons I met mothers who were the real women of suburbia They came in all sizes and styles  executives and homemakers doctors and artists a melting pot of ethnic groups and yes ladies who played bridge and felt good about that too Most of them Id never encountered because they too were too busy with their own occupations to be communityvisible I think the women who moved to the suburbs in the 50s were the victims of poor timing Their exodus coincided with the arrival of womens liberation and the two movements werent compatible at the time When word of this new female crusade seeped past the geraniums and into my house I joined up Certainly there were important universal issues that these people would deal with To my surprise however this wasnt always so The sessions became a melange of personal problems and the villain of it all was yes our friend the stereotypical suburban woman How dare she be so stupidly happy in her House and Garden kitchen when some of their lives were falling apart I know now that what I saw in those days was a backlash Like the kindergarten and the local committees the groups did contain all types of women In the beginning however those who were bogged down with problems often spoke the loudest The suburbanite with the supposedly idyllic life became a target as welcome as a beauty in a family of ugly ducklings Since that time the movement has provided places for troubled women to bring their individual concerns and the groups now get on with the business of dealing with issues that affect all women In the years that have passed my own suburbanbred daughters have grown up traveled the world from the Amazon to the Arctic and created city lives for themselves I dont know if eventually theyll opt for lives out here but if they do I suspect theyll be typical of millions of other suburban women And that means not typical in any way
SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY;   LEST MANKIND BE FORGOT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/books/science-technology-lest-mankind-be-forgot.html,TOWARD A MORE NATURAL SCIENCE Biology and Human AffairsBy Leon R Kass Illustrated 370 pp New York The Free PressMacmillan 2350 TOWARD A MORE NATURAL SCIENCE is a collection of 13 essays written over a period of 12 years loosely held together by the authors ethical concerns for the future of biomedical science Dr Leon R Kass who teaches in the Committee on Social Thought and in the College at the University of Chicago believes that modern science is incomplete because it does not encompass an overview of nature in general and man in particular His thesis is that modern biology has become enormously powerful yet at the same time more and more reductionist in both methodology and perspective so that mans soul is forgotten in the scientists concern for molecular events at the cellular level Since the time of Bacon the utilitarian aspects of science have become increasingly valued and science is judged by its ability to create new technologies rather than by its contribution to an understanding of mans place in the universe  knowing equals making in Dr Kasss words While there is nothing new in the tension between the standards society sets for itself and a science that is completely neutral on matters of morals and ethics it is Dr Kasss view that the erosion of the image of man as a noble creature is accelerating as both the body and the mind of man become subject to manipulation It is his thesis that mans ability to engineer himself using the techniques of molecular genetics may be the final blow to our concept of man as something more than a transient albeit complex biochemical system He acknowledges that it is quite possible to dissociate an understanding of a science that accepts only what can be proved from an ethical and moral value system that defies proof by our present scientific method but this does not satisfy him Not only is such a dissociation intel lectually unsatisfactory it may also be insufficient to control the potential excesses of a science misused by wicked or amoral men Therefore he sets for himself the formidable task of trying to conceive a more inclusive science that would encompass the human condition as something more than a series of biochemical reactions  but something less than divine How well does he fare in accomplishing his mission In my view not very well But I hasten to add that I do not know of anyone who could accomplish the synthesis Dr Kass aspires to I do not mean to suggest that his essays are uninteresting all are provocative and several provide important insights into the nature of man The book is divided into three parts with four or five essays in each part They are uneven in quality some are repetitious and all could have been shortened Dr Kass espouses most of the higher virtues but unfortunately for the reader brevity is not among them Part One entitled Eroding the Limits includes five essays dealing with the technologies now in use as well as with potential new ones that derive from our ability to perform in vitro fertilization genetic engineering and behavior modification with drugs or by invasive approaches to the central nervous system He refers frequently to Huxleys Brave New World and Orwells Nineteen EightyFour but there is little new he has to say except about the technologies that are now available to do what was only speculative when Huxley wrote Brave New World But he does make some important points His remarks about cloning humans selling human eggs and conceiving babies in laboratories have a science fiction quality that detracts from the more serious discussion of the moral and ethical issues involved I like his discussion of abortion as a moral issue that is larger than simply a choice to be made by the mother I would argue however that the moral and ethical decision should be based not only on the rights of the fetus but on the quality of life that the unborn child can anticipate once born There appears to be far greater concern today for the rights of the fetus than for the rights of the child I also think he makes an excellent case for evaluating not only the risks associated with in vitro fertilization inadequately studied in experimental animals before human experimentation but also for systematically evaluating the social economic and political implications of any
NEW MEXICO NOW HAS A LAW TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/23/us/new-mexico-now-has-a-law-to-protect-pregnant-women.html,New Mexico has enacted what one legal authority described as the first law in the nation designed for the protection of pregnant women California Georgia and Mississippi have statutes calling for the protection of fetuses against some criminal acts but the New Mexico law differs in that it is designed to protect the pregnant woman The legislation signed into law by Gov Toney Anaya on April 5 makes it a felony punishable by up to four years in prison to injure a pregnant woman in a way that causes her to lose her unborn child The new law stipulates that the injury must have occurred in the commission of another crime such as rape assault or driving while drunk and that it does not affect legal voluntary abortion An Intensely Emotional Area This is the first legislation like this I have seen said Janet Gallagher a leading authority on laws and court decisions affecting American women who is the director of the civil liberties and public policy program at Hampshire College in Amherst Mass Miss Gallagher said she considered the statute to be a very sane and workable approach in an intensely emotional area and said the bill provided pregnant women with special protection in much the same way that many states have special legal protections for police officers prison guards or witnesses for the state in courtroom proceedings Laws in other states that were designed to protect fetuses have sometimes been used against mothers Miss Gallagher said She cited one case in which a woman was sued by the father of her child because she took a drug while she was pregnant that caused discoloration of her babys teeth Compromise on Abortion Issue The bill was introduced in the New Mexico Legislature on the heels of three traffic accidents in the state involving intoxicated drivers in which three pregnant women two of whom were killed lost their unborn children According to State Senator Al Otero a Democrat who sponsored the bill the final legislation was a result of long sessions with antiabortion and abortion rights groups An effort to pass a similar bill in 1983 was derailed by arguments over whether the legislation could be used in an attempt to prevent abortions We wanted to remove it from the abortion context altogether Mr Otero said We therefore took the position that the focus should be the woman and that the child should be considered her valuable property A spokesman for an antiabortion organization said the group had supported the bill even though it believed the protections should have been given to the fetus We support legislation promoting the notion that the fetus is a separate legal entity and that its death in circumstances like these should be equated with murder said Dauneen Dolce administrative assistant for Right to Life New Mexico We didnt get that with this bill but we felt that if we lobbied to change the bills focus to the fetus there was a possibility the bill might be defeated just because of our involvement Passed by a Wide Margin Mr Otero said that once the two groups agreed on language for the bill it passed in the House 58 to 2 and in the Senate 22 to 12 Senator John Budagher a Republican who voted against the proposal said wryly that it was hard to take a stand that could be viewed as opposing protection for pregnant women Im not against the issue he said but I was and I am against the law He said he felt that the bill did not address the question of intent What if a woman is in a car accident in which her husband the driver who has had a few is at fault Mr Budagher asked I feel it would be destructive to the family unit if in a case like this the poor man who has already suffered the loss of the child then also faces criminal charges Janice Paster a lobbyist for abortion rights advocates in New Mexico said The bill reflects societys view that a woman has a right to complete a pregnancy if she so wishes

ACTIVISM AT SCHOOLS SEEMS TO BE STIRRING AS PROTESTS CONTINUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/25/us/activism-at-schools-seems-to-be-stirring-as-protests-continue.html,On college campuses around the country yesterday thousands of student protesters took over administrative buildings boycotted classes and held teachins rallies and marches demanding that the schools end investments in companies doing business in South Africa At the University of California at Los Angeles 200 protesters occupied a campus building yesterday after a demonstration Tuesday by more than 2000 students many bearing placards with slogans like Apartheid Kills and Divest Now In Albany two dozen chanting students staged a sitin at the business office of the State University of New Yorks central administration building And at the University of Madison at Wisconsin about 200 demonstrators occupied a conference room at the State Capitol Latest Sign of Resurgence The National AntiApartheid Protest Day organized by a coalition of student groups was the latest of numerous indications of a tentative and somewhat limited resurgence of student activism at American colleges and universities this spring For the first time in many years campuses are stirring to calls to take a stand on the political and social issues of the day The coalition estimates that protests were organized on more than 70 campuses Thus far most of the attention has been focused on Columbia University where on April 4 student protesters barricaded a campus building demanding that the university get rid of 325 million in investments in companies doing business in South Africa The Columbia protest is scheduled to end today without the students having achieved their stated goal But on other campuses including Harvard University the University of Louisville in Kentucky Oberlin College in Ohio and San Jose State University in California rallies marches and sitins on issues ranging from South African divestment to Central America and nuclear disarmament have broken out and are still in progress Those activities contrast sharply with the popular image developed in the mid1970s of university campuses as passive bastions of conservatism and of students as selfabsorbed and exclusively careeroriented Talks with students at universities scattered across the country indicate that they find that image far too simplistic and somewhat out of date In my eight years the climate on campus has certainly changed enormously said Tom Keenan a 25yearold graduate student at Yale University You can feel the difference between something like a forum to discuss things and the kind of movement that decides enough is enough and takes an active turn That seems to be what is happening this year Image of Passive Students The image of the passive campus was definitely correct for most of my college years added Mr Keenan who has participated this year in demonstrations against recruitment by the Central Intelligence Agency and in support of striking Yale staff workers But its definitely changing A recent study sponsored by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Council on Education indicates students support a wide variety of liberal positions The study published in January in the Chronicle of Higher Education is based on interviews last year of 182370 incoming college freshmen at 345 schools who were asked their opinions on a variety of political social and economic issues The survey conducted every year since 1966 found that support for increased military spending among this years incoming freshmen declined to 33 percent from 39 percent in 1982 A majority of the freshmen also supported a national health care plan and school busing for desegregation by the largest margin since the survey began and they also favored legalized abortion and higher taxes for the wealthy But support for the legalization of marijuana and abolition of the death penalty declined to record lows There was very strong endorsement for a number of liberal positions on what are viewed as litmus test issues said Dr Kenneth Green who helped conduct the survey There was no support at all for the idea of a universal monolithic trend toward conservatism among college students The current generation of college students differs from that of the late 1960s and early 1970s Dr Green said in that now there is less willingness of large numbers of students to act on their beliefs Minority of Students Student activists at several universities acknowledge that they are still a minority among their peers But they believe that the political climate on campus offers more possibilities for the emergence of a widely supported student movement than at any time since the end of the war in Vietnam a decade ago Until now concerned people on campus have felt they couldnt make a difference said Kevin Harris of the University of Colorado at Boulder who in March helped organize a student protest against Central Intelligence Agency activities in Central America In the march 478 people were arrested Indeed some of the new student activists believe that the current round of campus demonstrations will inevitably create a snowball effect that will draw new recruits to political and social causes The passivity you saw on campuses in the past came from a feeling of powerlessness said Jennifer Skurnik a 23yearold Yale senior One thing that breaks through that is the example of other people fighting A lot of people dont want to express their concern because they are in an environment that says its not cool to be concerned said John Muse a Cornell physics major But activism could become cool again Student activists were unanimous in agreeing that among their strongest recruiting points are the Reagan Administration policies and even the personality of the President himself According to a New York Times CBS News Poll fulltime students who voted in 1984 chose Mr Reagan at a rate 7 percentage points below that of the entire electorate with 52 percent of the students voting for Mr Reagan and 47 percent for Walter F Mondale I think a lot of whats going on is in reaction to President Reagan said Mark Lilly a junior at the University of California at Berkeley who has participated in recent demonstrations against South Africas policy of racial separation People are frustrated and aggravated with whats going on in El Salvador and Nicaragua People with a lot of pentup energy finally see a chance to do things constructively But perhaps just as important the students said is the emergence of a sense among students that their actions can produce measurable results  Also important the students said is a growing awareness on campus that political issues are not remote but can have direct consequences for students Military intervention in Central America and the reinstitution of the draft said Mr Lilly have the explosive potential to produce the instant coalescence of students into a mass movement Dr Green agreed If students are affected personally by an issue he said they show more willingness to get involved
ARIZONA COURT SAYS VIABLE FETUS IS A PERSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/26/us/arizona-court-says-viable-fetus-is-a-person.html,The Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that a viable fetus is a person allowing parents to bring action under the states wrongful death law The court said a fetus is viable once it is capable of independent extrauterine life but did not say when that occurs Joseph Richter of Phoenix a lawyer representing the couple whose suit prompted the ruling said today that the court would have to determine viabilty on a casebycase basis The ruling issued Wednesday came in the case of Jack and Charlene Summerfield of Mesa whose daughter was stillborn in 1981 The decision overturned a 1974 State Court of Appeals ruling that a fetus could not be defined as a person under the wrongful death law The new decision is similar to rulings in 32 other states Suit Had Been Dismissed The Summerfields sued Dr James Colleen and Dr Richard Lott for malpractice after their daughter was stillborn Their suit included a claim for wrongful death The case was dismissed by Judge Marilyn Riddel of the Maricopa County Superior Court on grounds that a fetus was not a person for purposes of the wrongful death suit The ruling was upheld by the Arizona Court of Appeals But the State Supreme Court in an opinion written by Justice Stanley G Feldman said that medical technology had advanced to the point that a viable fetus must be recognized as a person under the wrongful death statute There is no logic in the premise that if a viable infant dies immediately before birth it is not a person  Justice Feldman wrote Diabetes and Toxemia According to testimony in the suit Mrs Summerfield consulted with physicians after becoming pregnant in October 1980 because she was diabetic Hospital records said the cause of the stillbirth was diabetes and toxemia a condition associated with high blood pressure and inadequate kidney function Carol Jennings a Planned Parenthood spokesman said the decision was consistent with the 1973 United States Supreme Court ruling on the right to abortion She said that decision said the state has an interest in protecting the health of a fetus in the late stages of pregnancy Representative Jim Skelly an opponent of abortion who has introduced legislation that would define a fetus as a person at conception said the ruling recognized scientific fact But Mr Skelly a Scottsdale Republican called the issue of viability a stupid concept because of rapid advances in medicine

lawyer and former head of Tammany Hall compiled an annual roster of New Yorks 10 top power brokers  the most significant individuals making the most important things happen He gave up the list more than a decade ago If I wanted to do something today and was promised 10 people to make it happen who would I pick Mr Costidyan asked rhetorically Id be hard pressed Because when you say What is power one question is Is there power  There is power in New York City but its nature has changed dramatically in the two decades since Mr Costikyans days as a Democratic leader  days when public officials like Robert Mosses bulldozed entire neighborhoods to make way for highways when labor leaders like Harry Van Arsdale of Mide Quill or John DeLury settled strikes with a wink when Gov Nelson Rockefeller harnessesd his family fortune to public office and imposed his personal agenda unpon the city Who are the power brokers a young Mayor John Lindsay asked sarcastically in 1966 They know who they are They knew all right and so did everyone else These days its different Power has become more diffuse as more and more individuals gain influence Driven by the civil rights movement by reaction to the war in Vietnam by Watergate and by a growth in participatory democracy in general successive waves of reform loosened the hold of public officials on the machinery of government The citys 1975 fiscal crisis spend this trend by redefining roles Elected officials had less money to distribute Unions lost first claim on the city budget to private bankers who held the mortgage on the citys future An expanding public constituency  the newly empowered poor  placed overdue demands on city services while commanding a greater share of government funds through mandated welfare assistance Political power has shifted from the central city to the suburbs from City Hall to the courthouses The heads of virtually every hierarchal structure from good government groups to organized crime no longer command absolute loyalty Today more hands grip the decisionmaking process some never leave fingerprints As a consequence the people who are making the deals and shaping the future of the city are more than ever private individuals They never have to face the voters most New Yorkers dont even know their names Although they often band together to advance a specific project they seldom evolve into an enduring force The strength of the old power brokers was largely derived from the institutions they headed Personality self promotion visibility intelligence and an ability to conceive new ideas and promote them counted too of course but they werent mandatory Since rank no longer guarantees power these other attributes have taken on a new significance Some of the deal makers who exemplify the new power elite are behind New Yorks most ambitious blueprint for urban renewal in a generation the Times Square Redevelopment project For decades people talked about rebuilding the citys commercial and symbolic crossroads One plan after another was put forward then dropped Finally after four years of discussions the city and state agreed last year to a 2 billion package to be developed under the auspices of the state Urban Development Corporation subsidiary Why these negotiations succeeded illustrates how power is manipulated nowadays and by whom Although the state and city had worked together on the scheme for the 13acre complex of office buildings theaters hotel and merchandise mart their planners could not agree on which developers would get the lucrative contracts In 1983 a compromise was reached Although the principal actors were the mayor and the Governor the gobetween who arranged for them to meet was a respected private political consultant David Garth The developers included Trammell Crow a Texas billionaire making his New York debut who would operate the merchandise mart a Brooklyn condy company heir George Klein who would build the office towers and Jerry Speyer the managing partner of Tishman Speyer Properties recruited at the last moment to oversee construction of the merchandise mart Advancing the interests of Mr Klein and Mr Speyer among others was the ubiquitous public relations consultant Howard Rubenstein Competition among the developers and their lawyers and publicists for key roles in building and operating the merchandise mart the centerpiece of the project was fierce The man who was able to assemble the final cast was Ben Holloway of Equitable Real Estate Group a subsidiary of the lifeinsurance giant which owns New York office buildings and hotels valued at 19 billion Described by one city official as the glue Mr Holloway managed to unite developers who had never worked together as a group before and most likely never will again Minor characters in the Times Square scenario included activists on a local community board who gained promises of 25 million in neighborhood improvements in exchange for their blessing of the project But some players who traditionally might have been included were left waiting in the wings James McManus the Democratic district leader and scion of a political dynasty that has called the shots on the West Side since the turn of the century was never consulted Nor were the leaders of the building trades unions Not so long ago they would have been called upon to do more than pack the galleries for the project of this magnitude  they would have been invited to share the glory of announcing construction jobs in return of their guarantee of labor peace A generation ago their absence would have been unthinkable In fact with the exception of the Mayor and the Governor the principal actors in the Times Square story would have been totally different Groups of concerned citizens would have been relegated to the balcony but they would have been able to name all the players without a Playbill That cast had appeared together many times before sort of an urbandevelopment repertory company the Rockefeller family Robert Moses labors Van Arsdale Tammanys Carmine DeSapio and Francis Cardinal Spellman if a Catholic school or hospital happened to stand in the way or if anyone had the temerity to plan a new store that would open on Sundays Theodore H White gave men like these their name power brokers The name stuck the power did not supplementing  even supplanting  these power brokers today are the process brokers publicrelations specialists like Mr Rubenstein and media strategists like Mr Garth lawyers and lobbyists who can fight City Hall without ever having to go there These people understand precisely which everchanging combination of players and rules can unlock the doors to the community boards and the courtrooms They know how to bring together various and sometimes competing groups to make a deal and to get things done Mr White has a name for these groups too He calls them constellations of satrapies More than ever before the citys skyline and the everyday life of New Yorkers are being shaped by these inconstant constellations that form on single issues and then fall apart only to come together again in some new configuration when another cause becomes compelling No politician can chart their course for long no single leader of labor or business controls their movements Since they operate in a society run more by shifting coalitions than by a spirit of common purpose the deal makers are likely to be lured less by civic pride than by profit New York has always been a city of lets make a deal Now the game has become more complex There are so many rules Real estate is to New York what oil is to Dallas And as a 38yearold wildcatter Donald Trump is one of this citys most successful deal makers Defining power in this age is certainly different than it was 25 years ago says Mr Trump Things were done less delicately You used to be able to bull something through but power today is much tougher to achieve Certainly nobody now possesses the power of a Robert Moses A quartercentury ago Mr Moses held all at once the positions of chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and the State Power Authority parks commissioner and city construction coordinator If he was not above the law it was because he would have new laws drafted to justify his ends and his means Without popular consent he managed to uproot tens of thousands of people to build some of New Yorks greatest public projects However noble his goals by his arrogant exercise of power Mr Moses virtually guaranteed that nobody would command such power again It was the same with other powerful officials of his era Voters rebelled the processes of government were amended to make them less susceptible to secret manipulation Public officials more accountable and less independent could no longer steamroll their pet projects But Donald Trump with bucks to back his brashness has managed to get things done big things that many other builders have not In fact if Mr Moses were to be born again hed probably return as Mr Trump Ill say that I dont think of myself as having power Mr Trump says and yet if I want to do something I seem to be able to get it done He built the glittering Grand Hyatt Hotel on 42d Street and the glamorous Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue both with the benefit of propertytax abatements He bought the New Jersey Generals football team and signed up its star player Doug Flutie he has offered to build a new 85000seat stadium in Queens  if the city and state pay for and prepare the site Late in 1984 when he purchased a majority interest in the railroad yards west of Lincoln Center he became by some estimates the largest individual property owner in New York By no account is Mr Trump the citys wealthiest man But in Manhattan where in 1983 31 people each reported making more than 10 million what distinguishes the very rich from one another is what they do with their money Mr Trump is willing to spend his and persuade his partners like Mr Holloway whose Equitable Group is an equal partner in Trump Tower  to spend theirs Despite his disclaimers Mr Trump understands that power like muscle must be exercised to be maintained Private power is always wealth or leverage over wealth says Governor Cuomo If Donald Trump comes to me and says he can build a 270 million stadium without my money thats power Yankee Stadium  the house that Ruth built and Mayor Lindsay rebuilt more than a decade ago  was the last major public works project to be completed by the city on its own Since then virtually every change in the cityscape has been made by private investors acting alone or in partnership with some public authority The expansion of Equitables Manhattan headquarters one block west to a new office tower on 51st Street later this year for example will mark a 200 million commitment by business to transform Seventh Avenue from a gaudy strip of stores and Xratedmovie houses into what has been hailed as a spiritual extension of Rockefeller Center When James D Robinson 3d board chairman of American Express decided to remain in lower Manhattan and to situate his new corporate headquarters at the World Financial Center he too was making a commitment to the citys future And whenever takeover lawyers like Joseph Flom and Martin Lipton devise the legal means to save or swallow a corporation with offices or factories in New York they are determining where indeed whether people work Those decisions  whether to invest in New York or in the office boom in New Jersey and beyond  are vital to a city in which the employment outlook is precariously dependent on industries liberated from geographic constraints by technology These socalled switchboard industries are run not owned by a generation of managers of multinational corporations who lack any sentimental or for that matter economic stake in the citys survival The proliferation of red tape that hamstrings wouldbe power brokers gives new importance to the process brokers These people often comprehend the intricacies of arcane zoning and tax laws because they or their partners wrote those laws They include such lawyers as John Zuccotti the former deputy mayor William Shea whose power is commemorated by the Queens stadium that bears his name and Samuel Lindenbaum who has represented Mr Trump and whose father was a member of the City Planning Commission under Mayor Robert F Wagner The premier publicist among the process brokers is Mr Rubenstein whose client list reads like an interlocking directorate of who runs New York from the Real Estate Board to the New York Commodities Exchange to the Association for a Better New York For Mr Rubenstein focusing public attention on an issue is only one step in congregating the coalitions required to accomplish his clients goals He also has acquired an uncanny knack for sizing up grounds for compromise In 1983 for example when some developers balked at their minimal roles in the Times Square redevelopment Mr Rubenstein cautioned You have a long life to live in this city  dont be a warrior They backed off and eventually each was offered a slice of the pie In the old days a person with a problem would call a county leader Mr Rubenstein recalls Now they seek to form alliances Where there were five people who could do anything they pleased 15 years ago without going to jail and some of them eventually did go to jail now you have 50 or 100 people many of whom we cant even identify The turnout at the lavish 30th anniversary celebration of Howard J Rubenstein Associates last fall was itself a testimonial to Mr Rubensteins access and influence I came here for very selfish reasons Mayor Koch said I wanted to be where the power is Mr Rubenstein returned the compliment two months later He went to Mr Kochs 60th birthday party which raised nearly 18 million for the Mayors reelection war chest The guest list was studded with city VIPs Marvin Traub of Bloomingdales George Steinbrenner of the Yankees Jack and Lewis Rudin whose family is one of the citys largest owners of residential real estate Lewis chairs the cheerleading Association for a Better New York Preston Robert Tisch president of Loews Corporation and chairman of the Convention and Visitors Bureau Robert Wagner the wily former mayor lawyer and sometime process broker and Mr Trump The Mayor is the most visible symbol of power in New York which is one reason Mr Kochs birthday party was a sellout It also explains why he is booed at baseball games and why people court him In his memoirs Mr Koch recalls a breakfast meeting after his election in 1977 with businessmen and labor leaders it was hosted by David Rockefeller and Harry Van Arsdale Rockefeller said Can I get you some coffee and he went up and got me a cup of coffee Van Arsdale ran to get me a Danish It was extraordinary treatment And the reason it was so extraordinary is that neither one of these guys likes me and I suspect that none of the other 28 people in that room ever voted for me and they have had several opportunities So it is the office Now how do I know Because half an hour later Senator Javits walked into that room And over the course of one of the longest careers in the history of the United States Senate Senator Javits has worked for these very people    And when he came in only six people stood up and they sent a waiter to get him a roll The capacity of any mayor to deliver may have diminished over the last two decades reduced to the power to say no to competing demands for money But Mr Koch has made the most of what hes got Like Governor Cuomo Mr Koch has capitalized on his image as a political outsider Still both the Mayor and the Governor function at the sufferance of the legislative leadership in Albany and of the Federal Government In fact Mr Cuomo has singled out the Secretary of the Treasury as the most powerful figure affecting New York  From Mayor by Edward I Koch c 1984 published by Simon  Schuster fearing that if the Secretary presses a proposal to disallow income tax deductions for local levies it would drive business from hightax states like New York Since his party is in power Alfonse DAmato the aggressive Republican Senator from New York has become particularly influential Locally other officials have influence in specific areas Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau and United States Attorney Rudolph Giuliani for instance dominate the criminal justice system On another level it can be argued that the street mugger exerts a greater influence on peoples lives than does the police commissioner it is fear that often governs what people wear whether they ride the subway even whether they venture outside What power Mr Koch has gained has come largely at the expense of two groups organized labor and the Democratic political organization New York is still a union town and Albert Shanker of the United Federation of Teachers Barry Feinstein of the Teamsters and Victor Gotbaum of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees are among those whom candidates count on to deliver contributions volunteers and perhaps votes But the labor movement is not what it once was During the fiscal crisis New Yorks municipal employees agreed to givebacks and deferred wage hikes By investing heavily in Municipal Assistance Corporation MAC securities to bail out the city many union leaders were transformed from adversaries of City Hall to junior partners Indeed Harry Van Arsdale who has chaired the New York City Central Labor Council since 1957 now complains that success has had an adverse effect in many ways on the labor movement Once a mere telephone call from Mr Van Arsdale could settle a strike or produce votes for some jobgenerating public works project But the balance of power has tipped from bluecollar to publicservice unions In 1981 it took Mr Van Arsdale two months just to get a permit from the Police Department for the Labor Day parade Meanwhile the party chieftains who were the labor leaders traditional allies no longer enjoy even the illusion of power They are political retailers reduced to denying a judge renomination or exulting over the appointment of some deputy commissioner Roy Cohn a lawyer who is registered as a Democrat and whose law partner is Bronx Democratic leader Stanley Friedman claims better connections to the Reagan White House and the Conservative Party than any local Republican Party leader The Liberal Party has not recovered from the death in 1976 of its master of mirrors Alex Rose whose control of a line on the ballot gave him a strong voice  even a veto  in the selection of candidates and in public policy decisions Many elements undermined party organization campaignfinancing curbs primary elections which replaced clubhouse endorsements and the evolution of television into a campaign tool available to anybody with money In turn the use of televison gave rise to the media strategist David Garth who is credited with engineering John Lindsays reelection upset in 1969 annointed Ed Koch as a credible mayoral candidate in 1977 just by joining his campaign No autocracy has escaped the effects of the changing social and political climate For more than two decades Cardinal Spellman held the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and to a lesser degree the secular city in an iron grip because politicians presumed that he was capable of delivering the votes of the citys large Catholic population When the Cardinal and his emissaries spoke City Hall listened to their opinions on how to run the hospitals the school system the Family Court and other government institutions of concern to the church Under Terence Cardinal Cooke the Powerhouse as the archdioceses headquarters was once known generated less control and politicians and parishoners became less responsive Nonetheless during his short tenure Archbishop John J OConnor through force of personality and his shrewd use of the media has quickly managed to project himself and his philosophy into the public eye  a Catholic Koch some say The Archbishop has challenged elected officials who fail to express political opposition to abortion One measure of how times have changed is the public rebuttal delivered by Governor Cuomo a Catholic himself Philanthropy has also changed since the 1960s when the Ford Foundation dreamed of bridging educational gaps by decentralizing school districts The creation of three socalled demonstration districts had no conclusive beneficial impact on education but did manage to spark a strike by teachers and leave a legacy of racial tension Today the foundations programs and goals are often less ambitious Brooke Astor an unofficial arbiter of social status in the city is still powerful because she carefully calculates how to achieve the greatest possible benefits with the money the Astor Foundation gives away  136 million during the last quartercentury Mrs Astors brand of philanthropy is fast fading however few individuals preside over such vast personal fortunes Today recruiting Jacqueline Onassis to a cause such as the preservation of Grand Central Terminal guarantees publicity But Mrs Onassis and others contribute more by lending their names than by donating actual dollars Some such as Martin Segal the chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Vartan Gregorian the president of the New York Public Library are powerful because of their flair for fund raising and for building bridges between private philanthropy and public purposes Performers imbued with public spirit are more likely to get together for a specific benefit or to cut one record on behalf of the hungry in Bangladesh or Ethiopia than to endow enduring foundations that can underwrite programs with longterm goals Even David Rockefeller a power broker on everybodys list when he was chairman of Chase Manhattan and when his brother Nelson was the Governor is now regarded as more of an elder statesman While he has galvanized a broad representation of the citys business community to speak with a single voice through his New York Partnership the group has been more successful at calling attention to problems than at implementing solutions Mr Rockefellers support of the Westway highway and development project along the Hudson was not enough to nudge it through the bureaucracy and a 10year tangle of litigation Ive always found difficulty knowing what one means by power Mr Rockefeller says Certainly theres no way I can compel people to do what they dont want to do What I do have is the ability to pick up the phone and that facilitates things Theyre simply willing to listen and if it makes sense theyll do it I suppose you can say thats power The greatest instruments of power says Governor Cuomo are ideas that will win the loud consensus from the people and the devices that will communicate those ideas to the people The media deliver the message and mold public opinion and those who select and articulate the news are the most powerful he adds The Governor ought to know he was instantly catapulted to national prominence by his televised keynote speech at last summers Democratic convention Others who have achieved power by publicizing their philosophy include Donna Shalala the president of Hunter College of the City University and Felix Rohatyn a senior partner at Lazard Freres Mr Rohatyns official power is derived from his chairmanship of MAC the grid of bankers and businessmen that was imposed upon the city a decade ago to monitor its finances and borrow on its behalf But he is best known as a cerebral celebrity My power Mr Rohatyn says derives from my relationship with the Governor my independent position as senior partner of a successful investment banking house and my ability to communicate with large numbers of people through the press and through television The only real power I think I have is whatever power my ideas have to ultimately create change Among New Yorks newspapers The Daily News boasts the largest circulation but The New York Post has attracted attention because of its sensational treatment of stories Since it reaches so many opinion makers The New York Times is generally perceived as playing a special role in setting the agenda of public debate by its coverage of the news and its editorials Private individuals have used the courts to advance their ideas  and to have them enforced New York expects to spend 200 million this year to provide shelter for every homeless person who needs it thanks primarily to the efforts of Robert Hayes who as a young Wall Street lawyer filed a suit in 1979 on behalf of homeless men Similarly Marcy Benstock a community activist and Albert Butzel an environmental lawyer have succeeded in stalling the Westway project for a decade through their relentless campaign of lobbying public relations and lawsuits Fewer and fewer judges hail from the political clubhouse which might explain their willingness to make decisions without regard to fiscal consequences for the city  decisions that elected officials must weigh against the competing desires of voters For example in response to suits by the Legal Aid Society in 1983 Federal District Court Judge Morris E Lasker ordered hundreds of inmates released from an overcrowded city jail It is unlikely that any elected official would have dared to make such a decision Once again newcomers are starting to ask in various accents for their share of power New Yorks most recent immigrants  arriving from Asia the Caribbean South America India Pakistan and the Soviet Union  are boosting the citys percentage of foreignborn toward the peak 40 percent reached in the early part of this century They are also replenishing the citys middle class although they are placing immediate demands on city services Clearly the political structure is unbalanced racially says Mr Rohatyn noting that no black or Hispanic now holds elective citywide or boroughwide office These things dont remain that way In poverty pockets from BedfordStuyvesant to Harlem embryonic political coalitions are mobilizing both the poor and an emerging black and Hispanic middle class to speak with a louder voice Early this spring black and Hispanic candidates were mounting campaigns for mayor city council president and three borough presidencies Given the complexity of government whoever manages to gain office is likely to discover that it was easier to build the city than it will be to rebuild it If the leaders are to accomplish anything they will have to work with fluctuating coalitions  larger and more fragile alliances than ever before And they will discover that it will take months or years to realize goals that a handful of visionary power brokers could have achieved over breakfast only a generation ago If television made the medium the message then participatory democracy and the accompanying constraints on public officials exercise of authority have elevated the process into the power So many people now have access to the processes of government that none individually or as members of an elite group can reign with the impunity enjoyed by the power brokers of the past If this is a phase its going to last for a long time predicts Louis Winnick a deputy vice president of the Ford Foundation It takes a powerful threat thats felt by commonalities of people to cause them to plead for a king again
IDEAS & TRENDS;   The Pope Appoints His Princes,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-the-pope-appoints-his-princes.html,Pope John Paul II has sought to internationalize the Sacred College of Cardinals the Roman Catholic Churchs highest governing body reducing the influence of Europeans in general and Italians in particular and increasing representation from the third world He has also used his appointments to buttress his theological politics Both objectives were apparent in the selection last week of 28 new Princes of the Church The list included two Americans John Joseph OConnor of New York and Bernard F Law of Boston Both are from archdioceses traditionally headed by cardinals and both are firm supporters of the Pope who have become embroiled in the abortion debate Introduced at a luncheon as John Cardinal OConnor the Philadelphiaborn cleric allowed In deepest humility I must confess it does have a nice ring to it The Pope also elevated Miguel Obando y Bravo the Archbishop of Managua an outspoken opponent of Nicaraguas Sandinista Government He apparently edged out the slightly less conservative Archbishop of San Salvador Arturo Rivera Damas although another of the Pontiffs choices Juan Francisco Fresno Larrain of Santiago is a critic of Chiles rightwing military regime The appointment of the first Cardinal from Ethiopia Paulos Tzadua of Addis Ababa was viewed as a sign of the Holy Sees concern over both the famine and the Marxist regime that grip that nation Two of those named last week were from the Popes homeland increasing the number of Polish Cardinals to five a record five were from Italy two each from France West Germany and Canada and one each from the Netherlands Austria Spain Belgium Czechoslovakia Nigeria India Venezuela and the Philippines Another new Cardinal Myroslave Ivan Lubachivsky is the Major Archbishop of Ukrainian Catholics They are to be installed on May 25 and will bring the number of Cardinals to 152 of whom 120 are under the age of 80 and thus eligible to vote in the election of a Pope
PUBLIC ADVOCATE AWAITS JUDGESHIP,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/nyregion/public-advocate-awaits-judgeship.html,THE Senate is expected to confirm this week the nomination of Joseph H Rodriguez New Jerseys Public Advocate to the Federal District bench For seven months the confirmation has been delayed by Senate conservatives tests of Mr Rodriguezs liberal philosophies President Reagan submitted the nomination last September However at the adjournment of the 98th Congress in November the nomination still had not reached the Senate Judiciary Committee a delay that Democrats and Republicans alike attributed to electionyear maneuvering The President will nominate 114 Federal judges this year Traditionally the party in power wants these positions filled by those with a similar political allegiance In March the 54yearold Mr Rodriguez was given a questionnaire on such issues as the proposed equal rights amendment abortion and school prayer Conservatives on the Judiciary Committee said the questionnaire was designed to help them understand Mr Rodriguezs positions on some issues he might face as a judge But liberal Democrats said he was singled out for a political litmus test Three conservative Republican Senators  Jeremiah Denton of Alabama John P East of North Carolina and Orrin G Hatch of Utah  had requested the drafting of the questionnaire I say to you that whatever your position is on the ERA has nothing to do with your qualifications to be an able jurist Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio said at a committee hearing on April 17 As did Senator Metzenbaum the Judicial Selection Project a national association of publicinterest groups that is monitoring the selection processes of the Federal judges nominated this year also found the questionnaire inappropriate Susan Liss director of the project said that the questions presented to Mr Rodriguez were drawn up in such a way that they encouraged answers that might be interpreted as contrary to current law Moreover she said none of the questions pertained particularly to New Jersey Mr Rodriguez answered the 23 questions in a 16page response in which he wrote repeatedly that he would follow the laws guidelines and mandates of the United States Supreme Court Under questioning by the committee he reiterated his responses saying either he would follow the law or was unable to comment on pending cases During the twohour committee meeting the Senators argued often among themselves over Mr Rodriguezs merits but in the end the conservatives said they would support his nomination I have now received and reviewed your answers to these questions and can say that in my mind those concerns as to your qualifications have been resolved Senator Hatch told Mr Rodriguez Senator Denton said that his concerns over Mr Rodriguezs qualifications were resolved and wished him well in his new career A committee aide said that he had not heard of anyone who would block the nomination The vote is expected to be unanimous Two New Jersey State Senators  John H Dorsey Republican of the 25th District part of Morris County and Gerald Cardinale Republican of the 39th District part of Bergen County  wrote letters last year asking the Judiciary Committees chairman Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina to block the nomination Both state senators were at the April 17 hearing Many other state politicians from both parties have hailed the nomination Governor Kean wrote to the committee protesting the selection process The main qualification for judges is a strong belief in the Constitution he said Trying to narrow concerns beyond the Constitution is dangerous Where are you going to stop Mr Rodriguez a resident of Cherry Hill was born in Camden to a Cuban father and Puerto Rican mother He graduated from LaSalle College and received his law degree in 1958 from the Rutgers University School of Law In 1982 Mr Rodriguez was nominated by Governor Kean for the Public Advocates post From 1972 to 1974 he was chairman of the states Board of Higher Education and from 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the State Commission of Investigation Mr Rodriguez would be the first Hispanic Federal judge in New Jersey The position carries an annual salary of 76000 and is a lifetime appointment
IDEAS & TRENDS;   Protecting Pregnant Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-protecting-pregnant-women.html,What may be the first law in the nation designed to protect pregnant women has gone into effect in New Mexico California Georgia and Mississippi have statutes to protect fetuses against some criminal acts but the new measure signed into law this month makes it a felony to injure a pregnant woman in a way that causes her to lose her unborn child The bill was introduced in the New Mexico legislature last year after two pregnant women and their children were killed in automobile accidents involving drunken drivers In a third such case a woman survived but lost her child An effort to pass a similar bill was blocked in 1983 by arguments over whether it might be used to prevent abortions The new law stipulates that the injury must have occurred in the commission of another crime such as rape assault or driving while drunk and that it does not cover legal voluntary abortions
ACTING: IT'S A HARD-KNOCK LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/magazine/acting-it-s-a-hard-knock-life.html,This is a story of the actresss life It takes place in New York the theater capital of the nation the city to which thousands of actresses come each year chasing the same dream The actresss life is one of triumph and humiliation of curtain calls and cattle calls It is a life of two extremes  being on stage or being off stage And it is a life of one constant which is struggle Week in week out an actress takes classes does situps calls agents rehearses scenes sings scales reads the trade papers listens for the phone and when she can get cutrate tickets sees plays All of that is preparation for the theatrical proving ground called the audition An audition lasts 3 5 perhaps 20 minutes Those minutes can mean success but they usually mean rejection and the actresses who cannot endure the rejection leave the theater This is a story about two actresses in particular Leslie Meeker is 27 years old Marilyn Rockafellow is 46 Leslie Meeker is an aspiring actress looking for an agent and looking for a part Marilyn Rockafellow is a veteran actress trying to get bigger and better roles trying to sustain a career through middle age when roles for women grow scarce Neither of the women harbors many illusions about her chances of getting a job much less making a living in the theater Actors Equity Association the union of stage managers and performers has an annual unemployment rate of 85 percent Of the more than 33000 Equity members in 1983 only 5961 earned from theater work as much as 5180  the poverty level for one person set by the United States Census Bureau Out of work is part of the job Meeker says Its as big a part of acting as acting is And if you can handle that youre a pretty good actor When I first got to New York says Rockafellow an actor named Mordecai Lawner took me to lunch He said  Ill never forget his words  Do you know what job you signed up for Its looking for work If you dont like looking for work find another job Thats the best advice I ever got Marilyn Rockafellow stands at the end of a long line listening to a Walkman Sinatra she says My unemployment ritual In Rockafellows profession unemployment itself is a ritual By most standards Rockafellow is one of the lucky actresses one of the success stories In the last year she appeared twice on Broadway in Shirley Lauros Open Admissions and in Joanna Glasss Play Memory Both times she won enthusiastic notices and both times the plays did not Open Admissions ran for 17 performances Play Memory for 5 Rockafellow also starred in A R Gurney Jrs The Dining Room at the Actors Theater of Louisville Ky one of the leading regional theaters in the country The job paid 385 a week top dollar for the Actors Theater By the time Rockafellow had paid tax rent expenses and her agent she had nothing left from the sevenweek run Now she is applying for unemployment for the fourth time in a year It is 850 A M The line at the unemployment office at 20th Street and Avenue of the Americas has doubled back on itself several times This is a pretty good day not too crowded Rockafellow says When I first came to New York I hated this I got to understand why people on unemployment are so depressed It hits at the core of this society  that if you dont work youre no good The guilt knocked me for a loop For four years I wouldnt go for unemployment even when I was eligible But after 25 years as an actress Rockafellow has learned to grimace and take the check This one is for 180 Most of Broadway is sleeping off Saturday night when Leslie Meeker 25 floors above the Great White Way goes to work She unlocks the offices of Visionaire Communications an independent film company and lugs in a sevenyearold industrial vacuum cleaner that is missing two wheels Between acting jobs it is her meal ticket And for a young actress like Meeker there is a lot of between Meeker starts in the bosss office dusting his desk straightening his pictures and sinking to her knees vacuuming the ashes from the fireplace It has been five months since she finished her last paying theatrical job as one of the principals in My Three Angels a comedy at the Totem Pole Playhouse in Pennsylvania There have been dozens of auditions since then but no work She has scheduled two auditions for the week to come On Monday she will try for a telephone commercial The part calls for a Midwestern girl who has come to New York to make it as a dancer The other audition is a general call at the Theater Communications Group an alliance of 242 nonprofit theaters across the country that casts scores of plays for its member theaters Meeker wonders what monologues to use for the general audition She has Madge from Picnic  ingenues are her strong point  but she prefers to do pieces she has written One of them is about a young woman named Christina who cleans offices for a living Understand that I am not about these floors that I scrub Christina says That I have goals and hopes and dreams and aspirations That these floors that I scrub down here are getting me somewhere I want to be Up there I went to a rural high school Rockafellow recalls Middletown New Jersey There were few arts classes and few kids went on to college When I was a senior I was engaged My boyfriend was going to be a fireman and I was going to be a secretary One day in the spring of my senior year my father said Marilyn Id like you to do me a favor Go to college One semester If you dont like it leave and Ill support you So I went to Douglass In my first semester there I saw a poster for freshmen to audition for plays directed by seniors I was cast as an 80yearold woman After the play the chairman of the theater arts department came backstage took me by the shoulder and said the most important words anyone ever said to me My dear you have an enormous talent Have you ever thought about majoring in theater arts I went home that night and couldnt sleep Rockafellow majored in theater arts  and also entered and won the Miss New Jersey pageant in 1958 She graduated from Douglass College Rutgers University in 1960 and after working in both theater and television in New England took a masters degree in theater arts from Rutgers in 1976 On Aug 1 1976 she moved to New York  I never felt rebellious as a kid but I did feel different recalls Meeker who grew up in Goshen Ohio I had a wild imagination My biggest game was staring into the mirror for hours and playing phonograph records and singing along Eddie Arnold Somebody Like Me I played that album to death I always thought that I wanted to be a nurse When I got a little older  16 17  I had this teacher who always talked about drama As a kid I was always being cute and funny and liked and in high school I was the good girl  homecoming queen captain of the cheerleaders National Honor Society And then to be in The Crucible playing this witch and feeling like I knew her as well as I knew myself That excited me I had a boyfriend Roger Dale Herrin Had sideburns Always cut first period I thought he was Gods gift to everything I loved him very much He asked me to marry him many many times But whenever he proposed I said no Roger was going to buy a gas station and make that his living I just couldnt see myself in Ohio married to a guy with a gas station I guess I always knew Id end up here Meeker majored in drama at Edgecliff College in Cincinnati After graduating in 1979 she worked in regional and summer stock theaters for two years then moved to New York on Sept 2 1981 When she is back home visiting her parents she says she sometimes buys gas at Roger Herrins station  After registering for unemployment Rockafellow begins making the rounds Unlike a young actress like Meeker Rockafellow already has contacts in the business She can get in doors But people she knows can forget The actors copout is Now I have a job and I dont have time to look Im too tired Im an artist I shouldnt have to deal with this  Rockafellow says Well everybody in this field is looking for work Thats the nature of it You cant just think its your dilemma The more established you get the more you need to make the rounds When Rockafellow first got to New York an older actor gave her a tip Every day make sure you spend eight hours working  acting studying making contacts whatever Every night Rockafellow still adds up her eight hours When she was starring on Broadway in Open Admissions she was already lining up her supporting role in Play Memory When Play Memory was in previews she auditioned for The Dining Room at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park While doing the play there she invited the casting director from the Actors Theater of Louisville to see it The director cast her in the Actors Theater production of the same play and while doing the play Rockafellow auditioned for yet another Louisville show Now between shows she is touching bases in New York It is an afternoon of kisses and compliments an actresss version of the campaign trail Rockafellows first stop is the office of Robert Cole one of the producers of Ma Raineys Black Bottom She has known him since his days as managing director of the Michael Chekhov Studio where she had studied Rockafellow is wearing amber slacks a cream sweater and dark boots  an outfit for an actresss budget designed to look expensive when it really isnt In the elevator she applies a fresh coat of lipstick She and Cole hug at the portal of his office Rockafellow talks about how Ma Rainey had touched her She mentions her interest in a new play by a young writer Could Cole see her in a reading of the play at the Ensemble Studio Theater next week He says he will check the date and try Im going to call you about that she replies Do that He pauses Youre wonderful Marilyn He pauses again Because youre out in the open They hug again as she leaves Rockafellow runs down Ninth Avenue to her next appointment with Fred Kolo a writer and producer In the hallway outside his office she brushes her hair She and Kolo hug at the portal of his office Did you see the poster for Zelda Kolo asks referring to a play he had produced Off Broadway People have been saying how good it was Rockafellow responds And I told them No one can produce like Fred Kolo  Kolo shows Rockafellow the script of a play he has written entitled Flirtations and asks her to consider a part in it She says she will She asks him to produce a showcase of A Streetcar Named Desire with her as Blanche He says he will think about itThey hug again as she leaves Next stop on a different floor in the same building is David Tochterman a casting director He had cast Rockafellow a few years ago in Arthur Millers The Price for the Pittsburgh Public Theater They hug at the portal of his office How do you feel about soaps Tochterman asks I have some soaps next month Yes yes Rockafellow responds God do I need the money I just had the two best artistic years of my life and Im poorer than ever  Leslie Meeker picks up the telephone and calls a casting director Shes in a meeting answers the secretary May I ask what its regarding I wanted to set up an interview about working for her Theres no way Shes booked into next month She gets a hundred photos a day Have you sent a photo Yes OK then Meeker pauses All right Another pause Bye Meeker is making her version of the rounds In the last three years she has sent out hundreds of copies of her photograph and resume to managers agents casting directors theaters producers directors anyone Several weeks after each photo and resume she sends a followup postcard with her picture on the front Several weeks after that she makes followup telephone calls I hate those calls with a passion she says because the people hate getting them You know they dont want to hear from you Meeker used to make the rounds in person but quite literally she could not get in the door In New York theater getting a good agent is as important and as competitive as getting a part A powerful agent like Sam Cohn can place his clients in the choicest of roles but his clients are the Kate Nelligans and Glenn Closes not the Leslie Meekers or even the Marilyn Rockafellows Meeker does not have an agent yet although she works on occasion through Nancy Curtis of the Bret Adams agency who has steered her toward some auditions most recently one for Room Service at the Pittsburgh Public Theater But unlike a signed client of the agency she does not get regular referrals to auditions Without such an entree she must find her auditions through the trade newspapers as do hundreds of other actresses On many mornings Meeker has gotten on line at 7 oclock to wait hours for a fiveminute audition This business is so tricky Im always facing closed doors she says My reaction to rejection is What am I doing wrong What do I have to do   I cant do this in my dungarees Rockafellow declares Its a different world Ive got to put a skirt on She goes to the bedroom of her tworoom apartment leaving Carol Rosenfeld her acting coach in the living room Rockafellow is working on a monologue from The Winters Tale in which Hermione addresses the court that has accused her of being unfaithful to her husband the King She wants to have the speech ready if she ever auditions for a Shakespearean role Rockafellow returns wearing a skirt Rosenfeld has her read Hermiones speech without any inflection That done she begins to guide Rockafellow into the character You are on trial she says No one is going to help you How many people are in the court Rockafellow asks I have to find out She pauses Maybe I cant do this in the living room The living room Rosenfeld assures her is fine for now Again she pushes Rockafellow toward the emotional center of the speech Think of someone in your life who betrayed you she says Betrayed you emotionally personally Inflicted unreasonable insane pain on you Forget all that other stuff Rockafellow delivers the speech in a hard direct voice She does it a second time the speech grows stronger and she is obviously relieved The whole thing is gushing out she says The two women hug affectionately and dance a little rumba  Leslie Meeker walks down the steps next to a liquor store on Hudson Street She opens the door to the Polaris Repertory Company a basement theater rented collectively by about 30 actors It is Wednesday night and time for acting class taught this month by Pat McCorkle a casting agent Tonights class McCorkle says will center on sightreading scenes from a screenplay She then spends an hour of the threehour class telling stories about Sissy Spacek and Kevin Kline and the other stars she has cast The students laugh and fidget Ninety minutes into class Meeker gets her chance She and Bob Horen an actor friend from Cincinnati read a scene between two professors It takes perhaps two minutes Then two other students read the scene Everybody read the scene well but you got the humor McCorkle says indicating the second couple But thats not taking anything away from the way Leslie and Bob did it Meeker looks downcast She bites her lip OK McCorkle says as Meeker returns to her folding chair Who do we have for our next scene  This is what it cost last year to be an actress  to be pretty and charming at all times for business not pleasure  as recorded in Marilyn Rockafellows financial journal hair care 700 cosmetics 400 health club 500 telephone 1000 travel 1000 coaching 600 photographs and resumes 300 theater tickets 700 commission to agent 3000 outoftown rent 1000 trade publications 200 scripts 50 meals with producers directors and casting agents 1000  Francis Parkman Meekers husband enters the West 49th Street apartment carrying the morning newspaper and a copy of Back Stage one of the weekly trade papers On Thursday mornings when Back Stage appears Parkman and Meeker check the lists of auditions All in all Parkman says there aint much For three years Parkman and Meeker have celebrated and cursed the acting life together They live in a 473amonth railroad flat with no bell Visitors announce themselves through the front window They have furnished the apartment inexpensively yet lovingly with knickknacks from garage sales and with furniture scrounged from gutters and refinished at home Month by month they take turns paying the bills from separate checking accounts They often laugh about their early misadventures in New York  the time Parkman went to an audition for an independent film that turned out to be pornography the time Meeker took a waitressing job and was invited by her boss to become a call girl But when their careers fall out of equilibrium when one is acting and the other not marriage can become tense Last year Francis did a showcase of Desire Under the Elms  Meeker recalls and some director loved it and decided to take it to Florida And this was Francis who usually does soaps and commercials So he was ecstatic And at the time I was cleaning like eight apartments a week I cant tell you how depressed I was I knew no agents I had no auditions And he blows into the apartment and says Im going to Florida with the show As much as I loved him I did not care I was nothing but jealous It only makes me feel good when Leslies working Parkman says But money is another thing Last month I felt guilty because all the money coming in was from Leslie while I was doing all these freebies  showcases Off Off Broadway But I think we wiped out the whole pride thing a long time ago Hells Kitchen and a small savings account are fine for now but both Parkman and Meeker have thought about having children Its hard Meeker says I know Francis wants children But at this point we cant offer security  financially  to a child We could be up one year and down the next and thats something we cant control Its a frightening thing to think about having a family The telephone rings It is a friend an aspiring playwright asking if Parkman wants some construction work  Fredric Sirasky Rockafellows husband enters the West 45th Street apartment carrying a can of coffee two grapefruits and a copy of Back Stage For 15 years  since meeting when they ran a theater together in Rhode Island  he and Rockafellow have lived the life of frugality and mutual support that is relatively new to Meeker and Parkman When Rockafellow and Sirasky a playwright decided to come to New York in 1976 they sold the home that was their only major possession The money from the sale became their cushion in the city After six years it was all gone Now they live in a tworoom 358amonth apartment For four years Rockafellow says we looked at other apartments  bigger better I felt claustrophobic here It was Fred who really got me to stick it out People think artistic freedom comes from having money Its the opposite Artistic freedom comes from not having money When we moved to New York we made a decision never to have an overhead so high that we had to make decisions just to finance our life style That does not mean that even a modest life is easily supported by work in the theater Even as he writes Sirasky continues to give voice lessons and to work evenings as a proofreader for a law firm Rockafellow sometimes coaches and she tries to balance the theater roles she adores with lucrative commercials and soap operas One day in a soap opera can pay her 600 or about two weeks wages at a leading regional theater One Gravy Train commercial in 1981 brought in 9000  more money than she has made on stage in most years As Rockafellow has achieved greater success on stage she has made less and less money because she has had less and less time to do the money jobs In 1981 literally and figuratively her Gravy Train year she earned only 3000 on stage but 31800 overall In 1984 a year in which she was on Broadway twice she made 12000 on stage but only 21000 in total Sometimes Rockafellows father asks her if she and Fred will have enough money for their old age Friends tell them they live like kids and that it is time for a less precarious existence None of this has changed her mind I hear people especially actors constantly blaming something outside of themselves for their predicament she says I never did that I always believed I could do what I wanted to do Now I wont lie to you I wouldnt mind if someone gave me a major film role I wish Open Admissions had had a long run I think about hitting the top But my goal isnt money It comes from my family I guess My father was a builder He made money but what he cared about most was making a beautiful house Using good materials Joining the wood just right He built the house I grew up in My father was a businessman but he didnot talk about business He talked about the quality of his work  Meeker goes to the audition for the telephone commercial There are already four or five other actresses in the office all younger than she all more Midwestern  At 1120 AM Rockafellow walks into the Minskoff Rehearsal Studios on Broadway and 44th Street and sits down on a folding chair in the hallway She opens a script and silently reads her two scenes At 1150 she has an appointment inside Studio No 4 to audition for P J Barrys The Octette Bridge Club The play is a godsend for a middleaged actress  all eight roles call for women older than 35 As Rockafellow waits Roberta Maxwell is already auditioning The women are rivals of a sort both having played the lead role in different productions of Open Admissions The Maxwell audition goes on past noon By now four other actresses are waiting to audition Youd think Laurette Taylor is in there one of them says She wouldnt have to read another responds Rockafellow rolls her eyes She has geared her entire morning toward reading at 1150 and now at 1228 she is worried about losing her concentration She kneels in the hall puts her hands on the floor her head on her knees and closes her eyes Yet another actress arrives The sound of a dance rehearsal in another studio drifts into the hall Finally at 1230 Maxwell exits and Rockafellow enters The producer director and author of the play as well as three people from a casting agency are seated at folding tables at one end of the long empty room Rockafellow reads her scene at the other end and one of the casting agents takes notes The scene ends Good good says Tom Moore the director He asks for the second scene A casting agent looks at Rockafellows resume as she reads When the scene ends Moore says Very good and Rockafellow leaves Normally Rockafellow says auditions do not intimidate her Over the years she has learned the decision is out of her hands But today has been different all that waiting has somehow thrown her On the street she realizes that she has left her umbrella behind At lunch still jittery she has two glasses of wine  Shortly before 2 PM Meeker enters the Lexington Avenue offices of the Theater Communications Group She is one of 40 people Nick Wilkinson the casting director will see that day and one of perhaps a thousand that he will audition in the year When Meeker enters the room Wilkinson already has a pile of photographs and resumes next to the coffee cup on his table Meeker turns her back to Wilkinson tries to clear her head turns again to face him and goes into her first monologue It is Salina Simple a Cockney girl recalling her abortion  a piece Meeker wrote Wilkinson makes notes with his right hand and rests his chin in his left hand The monologue ends and without prompting Meeker again turns her back to Wilkinson concentrates and turning to face him goes into her second scene It is another piece Meeker wrote about a loopy opera teacher Ken Costigan Meekers acting coach had encouraged her to use the two pieces in combination to show her range But as Meeker portrays the teacher today she realizes that Wilkinson is getting bored When Meeker finishes Wilkinson asks her if she can do something from a contemporary American play Meeker tenses She hasnt prepared anything like that But she cant say no to Wilkinson Hows Madge from Picnic Fine She delivers the minutelong speech without a slip Wilkinson seems pleased He asks Meeker to sit and talk for a few moments She rests uneasily on the chair her hands gripping the edge as if she were clinging to the ledge of a tall building Wilkinson tells Meeker not to resist doing ingenues like Madge Is she open to working out of town for a month or two at a time Yes Can she sing Chorus yes lead no Meeker relaxes a bit sitting back into the chair And then 10 minutes after it began the audition ends On Lexington Avenue Meeker exhales Oh God she says Im glad thats done You stumble on one word and its all over  Rockafellow gets a call from the casting agency telling her she was not selected for a role in The Octette Bridge Club But later in the week she learns that she was cast as one of the leads in J F OKeefes Ride the Dark Horse the part for which she had auditioned while doing The Dining Room at the Actors Theater of Louisville  Meeker never hears from the agency casting the telephone commercial Wilkinson of the Theater Communications Group says he could imagine casting her in the right part but does not have one now But Meekers audition for the Pittsburgh Public Theaters Room Service pays off She is cast as Christine the ingenue  When I was in Louisville doing Dining Room  Rockafellow says I had a dream It was that I wrote my own review of the show And I dreamed it said Marilyn Rockafellows work added depth to the whole experience of theater Thats what you have to do in this business You have to be able to write your own reviews  Leslie Meeker stands on a street corner listening to a Walkman The soundtrack from Fame  she says Isnt that perfect
IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/books/in-short-nonfiction.html,ABORTION Moral and Legal Perspectives Edited by Jay L Garfield and Patricia Hennessey University of Massachusetts Cloth 30 Paper 1395 The intensely emotional debate about abortion is not conducive to polite intellectual debate about metaphysics moral philosophy or constitutional theory And if this leaves a gap in our capacity to understand and resolve the abortion question Abortion fills it Jay L Garfield who teaches philosophy at Hampshire College in Amherst Mass and Patricia Hennessey a practicing attorney in New York have compiled 12 essays on abortion by experts in jurisprudence philosophy and bioethics Beginning with a lucid exposition of the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision that made abortions legal this ambitious anthology evolves into an arcane discussion of some very murky questions What is the nature of personhood and what is its relevance to the abortion debate What is the moral relationship between mother and fetus and what are the mothers rights to privacy and personal autonomy Should we empower the state to define and enforce a moral obligation to bear a child once conceived The contributors differ in their answers and in their approaches to resolving the basic question about a fetal right to life One essay suggests that deciding when human life begins is a simple matter of legislative discretion let Congress decide the way it decides what constitutes a violation of voting rights under the 14th Amendment Others suggest that perhaps we should not attempt collectively to resolve the question at all It is doubtful that anyone will be persuaded by these essays But some with the patience to decipher them may be enlightened
THE TALK OF PENSACOLA;   PORT CITY WOOS BATTLESHIP SQUADRON,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/30/us/the-talk-of-pensacola-port-city-woos-battleship-squadron.html,Four centuries after the Spanish discovered there was no El Dorado hidden in the piney hills above Pensacola there are hopes once again that this old Gulf port is going to hit pay dirt This time hopes are pinned on the Navys plan to assign a new battleship squadron to the Gulf of Mexico as the military bolsters its ability to meet future tasks in this hemisphere Pensacola with its deepwater bay and its naval air station is considered a leader in the competition for designation this spring as the home port If Pensacola is chosen all or most of the squadrons nine large ships of war including the refitted battleship USS Wisconsin would be based here adding an estimated 50 million a year to the local economy and bringing in 9000 sailors and their dependents The naval air station which dates to 1914 already has some 16000 officers and enlisted men Worry About Development But there is concern about how the squadron would affect an area already under pressure from development A lot of people are afraid that Pensacola will turn into just another Navy town like Norfolk Peter McDavid a local lawyer said as he sipped a drink the other night in Trader Jons which for 35 years has been a home away from home for Navy fliers That many more sailors will change the tone of this city Mr McDavid said So what shot back his drinking companion a lawyer and former Navy pilot who said his name was Tom Im all for it I live and die by the Navy The Navy paid for my education and taught me to fly Its not every day you get a 50 million shot in the arm The prospect of a changing future comes as Pensacola tries to preserve its historic past four centuries marked by turns of high hopes and deflation The Spanish who arrived here in 1559 six years before St Augustine was founded despaired of making the area a profitable settlement There were also hurricanes that blew suddenly out of the gulf and plagues of yellow fever Even so the natural port attracted other empirebuilders by the end of the Civil War Pensacola had changed hands 13 times in three centuries Since then Pensacola has slumbered in uneventful obscurity though there was a surge of tourists at Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island across the bay when Geronimo and 20 of his Apache warriors were imprisoned there in 1886 Pensacolas economy was sustained by lumber and turpentine interests until the yellow pine forests were exhausted and later by the air station which brought Pensacola pride as the cradle of naval aviation Now said Norman Simons curator of Pensacola Historical Museum growth has been so incredible in the past four or five years that we stand to lose our national historic designation if any more new buildings are put up in the old section on the waterfront The museum is inside the 150yearold Christ Church in the Seville district of the city Once a roaring redlight district that drifted into disuse and neglect the Seville district has undergone extensive changes in recent years to attract tourists and restore a taste of nightlife to the waterfront Old wood homes now house antiques and boutiques and converted brick warehouses offer trendy bars restaurants and jazz bands The topless dancers have gone but little else seems changed since Martin Weissman a New Yorker opened Trader Jons in a former brick warehouse in 1950 He still works the bar wearing unmatched socks patched shorts and hats and Tshirts sent by Navy men around the world The juke box bangs out hits pool balls click sharply and men sit at the bar on leathercovered barber chairs You never know wholl show up here said Tom the lawyer and former Navy pilot An admiral or an astronaut might walk in he said or a onetime flier showing his grandchildren his picture as a young cadet among the thousands of smiling faces all over the walls Overhead old flags and insignia are spread like tapestries Model combat planes hang on wires and various reminders of cadet days at Pensacola stud the walls The hit movie An Officer and a Gentleman was not filmed here because Pensacola officials thought the script portrayed aviation cadets in a bad that is to say oversexed way But the offduty hangout in the film T Js got good reviews here for its packs of husbandhunters and a raunchiness redolent of the real Trader Jons When four young local people were being tried a few blocks away in the bombing of abortion clinics the proceedings got only derisory mention at Trader Jons Its crazy Tom said Hey I used to bomb people in Vietnam but this is America Of Fliers and Sailors Most of the talk dwells on a 70yearold topic the qualitative difference between ships and planes and the people who run them Mr McDavid the other lawyer worries that a battleship base here would mean conflict between the brown shoe Navy the fliers and the black shoe Navy the sailors Howre they going to get along in one small town like Pensacola huh another bar patron asked To a mention of stiff competition from Corpus Christi Tex Tom harrumphed Pointing to one of the pictures on the wall he said That theres John Lehman Secretary of the Navy Hes a Naval aviator class of 1965 and thats why the battleships coming to Pensacola right Right the others sang out and the smiling face seemed to look down with a special benevolence

CHURCH HOMES OFFER ALTERNATIVE TO ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/04/us/church-homes-offer-alternative-to-abortion.html,When Paulas father discovered she was pregnant he said that if she did not have an abortion he hoped her baby would die I had to get away from that thinking said Paula who is 17 years old I had to figure out for myself how I was going to deal with all this At an aunts suggestion Paula joined 34 other young women at Family Life Services a maternity home in this town of peaceful treelined streets The residence founded in 1982 by the Rev Jerry Falwell is typical of a new kind of maternity home that has sprung up from Orlando to San Diego and from Kansas City Mo to Hillsboro NH in an effort to reduce the incidence of abortion More than 300 such residences virtually all of them sponsored by churches or conservative Christian organizations have opened since 1980 according to Dr Gary Bergel director of Intercessors for America a Christian prayer group that conducted a survey of maternity homes The goal according to those who run the residences is to reduce the number of abortions by offering unwed pregnant women an opportunity to sort out their thoughts and plan for the future with help from professionals and without pressure from families or lovers When Paula checked into Family Life Services in midFebruary she was assigned a sunny bedroom a counselor and a list of household chores She was enrolled in the high school courses she was missing and in programs to teach her about infant care budgeting and natural childbirth They made me think about every little thing you could imagine said Paula an 11th grader who has decided to return to her mothers home in South Carolina to raise the child she expects about May 27 Food doctor bills disposable or cloth diapers  now I know I can handle it she said Plus Ive been saved since I got here Family planning groups are wary of the new maternity homes They avoid mentioning that abortion is an option said David Andrews executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America The danger is that a woman who might consider one is denied that right The Rev James Savely director of Family Life Services disagreed The difference is that Planned Parenthood talks about alternatives to pregancy and we talk about alternatives to abortion he said Our goal is to preserve life The rate of abortions around the country stabilized in 1981 and decreased 17 percent in 1982 according to the most recent data from the Alan Guttmacher Institute an independent research organization that used to be part of Planned Parenthood While the institute attributes the decline to a change in demographics Christian groups contend it results largely from the growth in maternity programs Several members of Christian groups said most of the homes were not being established in urban centers because of the cost involved and because in a place like New York for instance there was less of a stigma for an unmarried woman to carry a baby than there would be in a small town The Roman Catholic Church has also been involved in providing care for unwed mothers Archbishop John J OConnor of New York and Archbishop Bernard F Law of Boston have said that the resources of the church would be provided without cost to women who decided to bring unplanned pregnancies to full term The Archdiocese of New York plans to open a home for 19 women in lower Manhattan in May and one for 22 women in the Bronx by early June A number of experts in maternity care say the Catholic Church has not matched other religious groups in providing such services but the Rev Francis X Irwin secretary of social services for the Archdiocese of Boston said the church acted in response to peoples needs The homes in the area are not filled to capacity he said If and when they are we will work to open more Third Wave of Homes The new Christian homes which typically house 3 to 35 women 12 to 21 years old mark the third wave of maternity homes in the United States according to William Pierce director of the National Committee for Adoption The first wave appeared before the Civil War he said and was made up of institutions resembling hospitals for unwed pregnant women rejected by their families The second phase at the beginning of the 20th century produced large institutions like the Edna Gladney Home in Fort Worth which with a capacity of 174 remains the largest home in the country At such homes the goal has usually been to provide children for adoption But scores of maternity homes began to shut down in the mid1960s as contraceptives and illegal abortions became more readily available The decline steepened when the right to abortion was recognized in 1973 Today the homes are less retreats for ashamed women than places where the young mothers acquire budgeting and career skills that help them prepare for futures with or without their babies At Family Life Services two trailers in the yard serve as a school where young women keep up with their academic work There are two fulltime instructors on the staff and eight local teachers volunteer as tutors Traditional institutions such as the Edna Gladney Home have also changed to include schooling and career counseling said its director Eleanor Tuck We try to make sure that the girls who have already completed high school learn wordprocessing or another office skill she said Watching the Budget A large part of the program at most maternity homes is devoted to budgetary planning At Family Life Services volunteers show residents how to compare prices while shopping At the homes being set up around the country by James and Anne Pierson a couple who started a corporation called Loving and Caring Inc residents use workbooks that include such chapters as What Does a Child Cost Nursery Needs and Medical Needs I couldnt believe that bibs are 189 each said Beth Mansell a 20yearold resident of a Pierson home in Hillsboro NH And they say you need four of them I decided Ill buy terry cloth and make them myself Maybe I will make some to sell Secular maternity homes are also experiencing increased demand with the Edna Gladney Home for example at capacity after years of dramatically decreasing demand An Emphasis on Religion But the strongest force behind the movement experts in pregnancy care say is a religious revival in the country and the new homes reflect that interest At Family Life Services as at virtually all the homes residents must study the Bible and go to church I think the Lord sent me here to remind me to be a good Christian said Paulas roommate who added that she planned to continue going to church after she left the maternity home The experts also say that the movement has gained credibility in part because President Reagan is a vocal opponent of abortion Mrs Pierson says she has appointments lined up until the end of the year with communities that want her advice on how to begin maternity homes Mr Savley director of Family Life Services said that he had had 7000 such requests and that Save a Baby Inc the maternity homes parent organization hoped to establish 1000 maternity homes by 1989 Dr Bergel of Intercessors for America said the homes were a positive alternative to abortion clinics American cities now have life centers visibly competing with Planned Parenthoods death chambers he said

O'NEILL DECISION SPURS STAMPEDE FOR HIS SEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/05/us/o-neill-decision-spurs-stampede-for-his-seat.html,Over almost half a century only three men have represented the Eighth Congressional District in Massachusetts First there was James Michael Curley nearing his last hurrah then a young politician named John F Kennedy and since 1953 when Dwight D Eisenhower replaced Harry S Truman in the White House Thomas P ONeill Jr In other words there is a certain pedigree in the Eighth which embraces Cambridge parts of Boston and the workingclass suburbs of Somerville and Watertown But now Mr ONeill Speaker of the House of Representatives has announced he will not seek reelection next year and his withdrawal has touched off a stampede among local Democratic politicians of which there is no scarcity Active Campaigns Already So far with the election 18 months away a State Senator three State Representatives and an antinuclear activist have begun active campaigns for Mr ONeills duchy At least seven other people say they are seriously considering running including two Mayors a black State Representative who received an honorary degree from Harvard University after leading protests against the schools expansion into her poor neighborhood and Melvin H King the black community leader who ran a strong race for Mayor of Boston two years ago It seems like everyone with 10 friends is giving it some thought said George Bachrach a maverick liberal State Senator who is one of the early frontrunners But the most intriguing speculation centers on two other possible candidates Edward M Kennedy Jr the 23yearold son of Senator Edward M Kennedy and James Roosevelt Jr a Boston lawyer and state Democratic Party activist whose grandfather was Franklin D Roosevelt and whose father was a sixterm Congressman from California Could there be a KennedyversusRoosevelt race The younger Mr Kennedy who lost his right leg to cancer when he was 12 years old recently moved from Virginia to an apartment in Somerville He is also in the process of opening an office in Boston where he plans to run a foundation for what he terms the physically challenged according to friends Charting His Prospects For the moment his friends and family members insist he has not made up his mind whether to run But hes moving around as they say one close relative said charting his prospects With his name the Kennedy familys popularity in Massachusetts and his access to wealthy fundraisers Mr Kennedy would be a formidable candidate his possible opponents concede Furthermore he is likable and admired they say and few of his rivals begrudge his possible candidacy Mr ONeill has not been seriously opposed in years so the Democratic primary in the fall of 1986 may produce the most pyrotechnics since Mr Curleys time At a rally in the 1942 Democratic primary Mr Curley recounted in his autobiography Id Do It Again he told his audience he wanted to introduce his opponent But before his rival J Ralph Granara could mount the rostrum Mr Curley grabbed a black air raid warden and introduced him as Mr Granara The crowd went wild and so did Granara who made an effort to haul me into court Mr Curley wrote In the general election when his Republican opponent was Tom Eliot son of a Unitarian minister Mr Curley told an audience that the Unitarians are a curious sect who seem to believe that Our Lord Jesus was a young man with whiskers who went around in His underwear Reagan Got 36 of Votes Today the Eighth District is one of the most liberal seats in the country About 62 percent of its 522000 registered voters are Democrats with only 9 percent Republicans Last fall the district gave President Reagan only 36 percent of its vote one of the lowest figures he received outside some predominantly black areas in Chicago and Philadelphia This district is so liberal most Americans wouldnt recognize it said one contender Thomas J Vallely a State Representative from Bostons affluent Back Bay Almost twothirds of the districts residents are tenants and 15 percent are college students one of the highest rates in America Harvard the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Boston College Boston University and Brandeis all lie within its boundaries The voters all know who the contras in Nicaragua are and you had better be able to talk about South Africa and the Philippines said Mr Vallely a 35yearold of Irish descent who won a Silver Star as a Marine infantryman in Vietnam and later earned a masters degree from Harvards Kennedy School of Government They all drive 1968 Volvos and wear old suits but its not a greedy Yuppie district he added They put their value in things they care about not money A LeftHanded Group One result is that almost all the possible Democratic candidates are drawn from the partys liberal wing This is a lefthanded group of people Mr Vallely observed Mr Vallely contends he is the least left of the group although he sponsored a homosexual rights bill is a Roman Catholic who favors abortion and received a 95 percent rating from the Americans for Democratic Action last year Farthest to the left is Thomas M Gallagher a 36yearold South Bronx native who graduated from Boston College and was an antiwar and tenants rights activist before becoming a State Representative The Boston Phoenix a weekly newspaper refers to him as an income redistributor some State House colleagues as Tommy the Commie Mr Gallagher scoffs at these labels preferring to focus on issues like more worker ownership of American industry This week he was the lone dissenter when the State House voted for a tax refund He argued that the money would be better spent helping the needy A Debate on the Party Mr Roosevelt who considers himself in the middle of the group thinks the campaign may provide a chance to debate in microcosm the future of the Democratic Party What we have to emphasize he said is that our policies like Social Security and student loans are not just for special interests but to help Americans as a whole Who will win John Marttila a political consultant says the political differences among the candidates may be too subtle for voters to grasp He thinks the better question so far before the vote is which of these people will provide the more compelling personal story Mr ONeill has become something of a forgotten man He is not backing any candidate and so far only Mr Roosevelt has openly praised the Speaker saying I disagree with the notion that Tip is whats wrong with the Democrats But then Mr Roosevelt has known Mr ONeill a long time His fathers House office was next to Mr ONeills

DIVIDED DUTCH CHURCH AWAITS POPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/11/world/divided-dutch-church-awaits-pope.html,Pope John Paul II is to arrive in the Netherlands on Saturday for the start of a pastoral visit and Roman Catholic leaders say he will find a deeply divided church that includes large elements actively hostile to the Vaticans positions on key issues The Popes fourday stay which is to be followed by visits to Luxembourg and Belgium will bring him into the midst of one of the most liberal Catholic populations in the world one whose views according to publicopinion surveys are widely different from those of the Vatican Of this countrys 14 million people about 6 million are Catholics The papal visit has generated intense conflict inside the church and elsewhere here over who will be permitted to see the Pope and what vision of the Dutch church will be presented to him These conflicts already existed Bishop Ronald Bar of Rotterdam said in an interview referring to the divisions between liberal and conservative Catholic groups They come more than usually into the open because of the situation Upholding the Churchs Unity The present Holy Father is almost charismatic Bishop Bar went on His way of being with people  and Ive experienced this myself  is to enable them to realize that in spite of the differences of opinion we are called upon to be one church We should not quarrel to such an extent that the unity of the church is endangered The church is divided said Richard Auwerda a spokesman for the Marienburg Group a leading organization in what is often called the critical church here The visit of the Pope could have made for a great deal of reconciliation but it will not The reason is that the bishops wanted to show the Pope one face of the church in Holland while keeping the other face out of sight A specific grievance cited by Mr Auwerda and others critical of the church hierarchy is that in their view access to the Pope during his visit is being restricted to groups and individuals who share orthodox views on such contentious matters as the celibacy of the clergy the role of homosexuals and women in the church birth control and abortion Dutch newspapers for example gave extensive frontpage coverage last week to the case of a theologian Catherina J M Halkes who was nominated by five womens organizations to represent them at a scheduled audience with the Pope Nomination Is Vetoed The nomination of Dr Halkes  who is a leading advocate of equality for women inside the church including their ordination as priests  was vetoed by the Archbishop of the Netherlands Adrianus J Simonis who contended that her appointment would produce polarization among Catholics His decision produced a storm of protest two of the womens groups with nearly 20000 members announced they would boycott the Popes visit Even as some Catholics here have been angered by the visit a separate controversy arose in the small Dutch Jewish population which following the tradition of papal visits was invited to meet with the Pope The Jews decided against the proposed meeting when the Vatican refused to meet conditions set by Orthodox Jews here which included a specific disavowal by John Paul of Pius XII the wartime Pope for failing in the Jewish view to take a strong stand against Nazi persecutions Among Catholics much of the furor surrounding the Popes visit seems to show the degree to which they have adopted extremely liberal positions that are theologically unacceptable to the hierarchy In a survey published by Elseviers Magazine the largest newsweekly in the Netherlands 69 percent of the Dutch Catholics who responded opposed the views of the Pope on priestly celibacy 62 percent opposed him on abortion 72 percent on birth control and 71 percent on divorce The Pope Not Welcome The survey which was published under the headline The Pope Not Welcome indicated that only 30 percent of the Catholic population supported the Popes visit and that a large majority either were indifferent to it or against it As the visit has neared however subsequent polls by the Catholic broadcasting organization have shown 53 percent of Catholics welcoming it Its a fashion in Holland to be against the institutions of the church Archbishop Simonis told the magazine And Frans Haarsma a leading liberal theologian from the University of Nijmegen said There is no country in the world where the gap between the hierarchy and the local community is as wide as it is in Holland The open hostility shown to official church positions here marks a major shift in a country that for centuries was known for its fidelity to the Vatican According to experts on the church here a close identification with the Vatican was a key element in the identity of Dutch Catholics for much of their postReformation history during which they have constituted some 40 percent of the population A Second Reformation It is widely believed that the work of the Second Vatican Council in 1965 particularly the encouragement given to building ecumenical relations with nonCatholic churches constituted a watershed in the history of the Dutch church unleashing a host of liberal impulses that quickly went beyond the changes envisioned by the Vatican itself Vatican II was called a second Reformation by some Dutch theologians Under the sponsorship of the countrys seven bishops a forum was established with the Catholic laity that formulated views on such matters as priestly celibacy that risked being declared heretical by the Vatican In 1970 when the bishops proposed continuing the forum by creating a national pastoral council the idea was rejected by Pope Paul VI That same year Pope Paul naming a new Bishop of Rotterdam broke with the tradition of choosing from a list of names submitted by local Catholic leaders instead appointing Bishop Simonis who was known as a conservative Subsequent appointments of generally conservative bishops in all but two of the Netherlands seven dioceses also bypassed local nominations stirring protests by an increasingly critical local clergy and laity Controversy erupted anew this March when John Paul appointed another conservative Johann Ter Schure as the new Bishop of s Hertogenbosch The appointment was followed by a highly publicized criticism by the church deacons in that diocese Newspapers reported that thousands of people appeared at town halls to withdraw their formal registrations as Catholics in protest against the appointment Issue Not Theological The issue is not a theological one Mr Auwerda of the Marienberg Group said referring to the divisions within the church It is the social aspect of things the atmosphere the way of living and meeting together in the church The appointment of a very conservative man as the Bishop was seen here as a provocation he said If the Pope had wanted a sign of reconciliation he would have appointed a moderate Many of the strains of discontent among Catholics were visible Wednesday when more than 100 groups gathered in The Hague for a demonstration intended its organizers said to show the other face of the church The demonstration attracted 10000 people who listened to speeches from dissident theologians including Dr Halkes and milled about dozens of booths set up by the events sponsors Among the positions advocated were the rights of homosexuals to be given the sacraments and to become priests permission for priests to marry and equal roles for women in the church We are gathered here not only to show the other face of our church but to celebrate it said Edward Schillebeeckx a wellknown dissident theologian In spite of the bad climate we oppose the pessimism which is growing in our midst

former Democrats may run as Republicans in next years election for the top three offices in Massachusetts Former Gov Edward J King a conservative Democrat who campaigned for President Reagan last year is very seriously considering switching parties to run for Governor in 1986 according to Paul May his former campaign manager and close friend Deadline Is June 4 Mr King has not yet made up his mind Mr May said But he must do so by June 4 the state deadline for party affiliation for candidates The two other possible candidates who both changed party registration last year are L Joyce Hampers the State Revenue Commissioner under Governor King and Edward Harrington a former United States Attorney Mrs Hampers is considering running as a Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor and Mr Harrington is actively soliciting support in a drive for Attorney General If all three of us run as Republicans said Mr Harrington it would represent a real realignment of the parties in Massachusetts A Significant Effect What is happening in Massachusetts he asserted is part of a nationwide trend made possible by Mr Reagan himself a former Democrat William F Weld a Republican who is the United States Attorney here and who is another possible contender in the Republican gubenatorial primary said he would welcome Mr Kings conversion Mr King has strong appeal among conservative bluecollar ethnic voters who have usually voted Democratic Mr Weld noted and his defection therefore could have a significant effect It could get these people to start thinking whether they are really Democrats or Republicans Mr Weld said Since our party is so small here anything that stirs up the pot helps King Advocated Tax Cuts As Governor Mr King was a strong advocate of tax cuts to help business he favored the death penalty and opposed abortion Democratic leaders in Massachusetts agree that Mr King would make a formidable candidate as John Sasso the chief secretary to Gov Michael S Dukakis a Democrat put it I would never take Ed King lightly said Mr Sasso who managed Mr Dukakiss 1982 campaign Mr Dukakis served as Governor from 1974 to 1978 before being upset by Mr King in the Democratic primary but came back to defeat Mr King in a bitterly fought race in 1982 Mr Sasso however believes that Mr King Mrs Hampers and Mr Harrington all have personal as well as ideological motives for switching to the Republican Party and that their changeover does not presage a fundamental reodering of the two parties in the state Democrats make up 49 percent of the states three million registered voters as against 13 percent for the Republicans Both Senators Edward M Kennedy and John F Kerry and all but one Congressman are Democrats In addition both houses of the state legislature are dominated by Democrats Wasnt Socially Acceptable Historically the Republican Party in Massachusetts was only for the rich the Yankees and the Protestants said Mr Harrington So it wasnt socially acceptable for Irish and Italians and workingclass voters to be Republican Mr Harrington whose grandfather was a Democratic minority leader in the State House of Representatives joined the Justice Department in Washington under Robert F Kennedy and was sent to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 to monitor the civil rights efforts there But Mr Harrington contends the Democratic Party in Massachusetts has become too trendy liberal controlled by men like Governor Dukakis Theres no room anymore for what we used to call the regular big city Democrats  Mr Harrington lists several areas of philosophic disagreement with the Democrats today The old party of Al Smith Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy was for a strong America he said We were brought up to support our President not help Communists in Central America Echoing Mr Reagan Mr Harrington also criticized The Democrats policies of tax and spend which started with Lyndon Johnson and liberals support for the right to abortion and homosexual rights Other Democrats contend that Mr Harringtons switch was primarily caused by a quarrel with the State Attorney General Francis X Bellotti a Democrat whom Mr Harrington openly blames for blocking his nomination as a state court judge But Mr Harrington insists his change in affiliation is not just sour grapes Mrs Hampers also had a heated quarrel with Mr Bellotti charging that he and Mr Dukakis were behind an abortive investigtion of her revenue department as a way to embarrass thenGovernor King But Mrs Hampers contends her motives were ideological It was the Democratic Party that turned not me she said She is now the Massachusetts head of Citizens for America a conservative political action committee that backs Mr Reagan Mrs Hampers said she is ambivalent about running for Lieutenant Governor Im going to the dance sit on the side and see if anyone asks me to dance she said In the case of Mr King even his friend Mr May admits that the former Governor would have a hard time running for Governor again as a Democrat against Mr Dukakis Mr Dukakis has taken over the state Democratic organization he has increased his popularity by being more conciliatory than in his first term and Massachusetts has the lowest unemployment rate of any industrialized state An Easier Way Running as a Republican would be an easier way said Mr May Not all Republicans would welcome his candidacy In his term as Governor several of his appointees were embroiled in corruption scandals and questions were raised about his competence There is resistance to King among some people I talk to said Cile Hicks a moderate Republican State Representative from a Boston suburb Republicans are a pretty puritanical group when it comes to integrity
DETERMINED TO LEAD,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/magazine/determined-to-lead.html,POPE JOHN PAUL II IS FOND OF THE WORD contradictions It is a useful word to describe not only the Church he leads but who he is how he thinks and what he does One cannot understand the Pope apart from his native Poland Yet nothing rankles the Pope or his supporters more than the tendency to reduce him to his Polishness Although he rejects the dialectical materialism of Marxism John Paul himself might be called a dialectical spiritualist He is relentless in his attacks on Marxism seeing in it not only a rebellion against God but a violence against the dignity of the individual which comes directly from God But he also makes fiery speeches against imperialistic monopoly uncontrolled capitalism and the luxurious egoism of the rich John Paul is an intellectual But he is dedicated to the intellectually unfashionable symbols of popular Christianity relics and statues devotions to the saints and above all the Blessed Virgin Mary He consistently subordinates the political to the spiritual but he has vastly increased the political influence of the Church He always and everywhere calls himself a Pope of the Second Vatican Council Yet his adversaries contend that he wants to roll back the reforms of Vatican II He is the most universal of popes sensitive to cultural diversity inside the Church Yet he has done more to centralize authority in the Vatican than any pope since the council The Popes supporters argue that the contradictions are more apparent than real In fact they say if he has any single goal for his papacy it is to overcome what he once called the signs of contradiction that have grown up in the Catholic Church He referred to these in a sermon in 1976 when he was Cardinal Karol Wojtyla The sermon presaged the papacy of a man not afraid of battles not worried about taking on enemies It is the task of the Church of the Holy See of all pastors to fight on the side of man he declared often against men themselves The present visit of John Paul II to the Netherlands is doubtless being made in that spirit The Netherlands  with its famously liberal Church  is one of the few places in the world where his popularity is genuinely in question In March a poll by a respected magazine found that only 3 percent of Dutch Catholics welcomed the Popes visit The story that will undoubtedly unfold this week in the Netherlands is in many ways the story of John Pauls papacy Where he found dissidence he has enforced orthodoxy Where there was uncertainty he has sought clarity Where the political power of the Church had declined he has sought new avenues of influence And in the Vatican where the very power of the pontiff seemed in question when he was elected Pope in 1978 he has clearly established a new and vigorous leadership Archbishop John P Foley the head of the Vaticans Commission on Social Communications summarizes the Popes objectives neatly in two simple words clarification and evangelization It is essentially a matter of being clear on what your message is and then preaching it selling it if you will to the faithful and those you hope will become the faithful says the Archbishop The Pope has been unusually successful in evangelization He is also universalizing the Church in a way that perhaps only a nonItalian Pope could do What Pope on the day of his coronation declared Im going to learn Spanish because Spanish is the language of the largest single group in the Church asks the Rev John Navone a Jesuit theologian at Romes Gregorian University This Pope was revolutionary because he didnt say You have to learn my language He said Ill learn your language  Of the 26 trips abroad John Paul has made thus far during his papacy about a dozen have been to developing countries Not surprisingly the Church is prospering in these areas notably in Asia and Africa Last month John Paul further internationalized the Sacred College of Cardinals the Churchs highest governing body by selecting onefourth of the 28 new cardinals from the third world Pope John Paul II intends to make the Roman Catholic Church and its 800 million faithful the most powerful moral force in the world John Paul says Paul Johnson the British writer is the Pope of the Catholic Restoration Yet what sort of Catholicism is the Pope restoring Is his strategy working And to what extent do the tasks of restoration and reform collide Evaluations of John Pauls papacy depend a good deal on politics for the Catholic Church especially under this Pope is constantly called upon to play a political role Not all Catholics agree that John Pauls style of leadership or his ideas are what the Roman Catholic Church needs as it approaches the year 2000 There is unrest among Catholics in Latin America the United States and large parts of Western Europe Many Church figures including some sympathetic to the Pope worry that John Pauls approach could divide the Church drive believers away and impede free inquiry by theologians In the West in the United States in particular large numbers of Catholic women are opposed to the Popes stance against birth control and his insistence on an allmale priesthood Yet even among John Pauls critics there is an acknowledgment that here is a Pope who knows exactly where he wants to take his flock who thinks not in the short term but of the third millennium John Paul is many things to many people but to all he is a leader determined to lead OHN PAULS PAPACY MUST BE UNDERSTOOD in two parts The more complex part has to do with the Popes vision of the Catholic Church and its relation to the outside world The simpler but in many ways more important part involves the effect within the Church of John Pauls restoration of authority to the papacy When this man came into office there was a kind of collective sigh of relief says Father Navone the Jesuit theologian With great respect for Pope Paul he was frail at the end of his life and people saw him as a bookish sort who often seemed uncomfortable with others John Paul I who succeeded Pope Paul died after only 33 days in office Then came this robust healthy young athletic selfassured John Wayne type continues Father Navone He had true grit In contrast to previous popes John Paul II is relatively young he will be 65 next Saturday handsome forceful effective with crowds Simply to cite who the Pope is and has been is to suggest a rich and complex human being a factory worker a poet a playwright a philosopher a gregarious outgoing man a sportsman who loves skiing canoeing and swimming He is a jovial man who loves to sing a stern man who can meet resistance with an icy stare and who is said to have a fierce temper a gentle man who is visibly and remarkably transformed at the sight of children a former actor  like the American President  who has always retained the knack of playing to an audience A farfromconventional religious leader John Paul II is having a profound effect on the papacy By mastering at least seven languages and learning the rudiments of many others including pidgin and Japanese and making frequent voyages to the far reaches of his Church John Paul is turning his papacy into one that is less and less anchored in Rome He himself has said that the Vatican could easily be in Manila what makes the Church Roman are clear lines of authority not the city where the authority lies And much like Ronald Reagan who has used his mastery of television and other communications techniques to help effect a social revolution John Pauls superb use of mass media is part of his Catholic Restoration One of the Popes preoccupations is with the growing distance between Christianity and modern culture For him one central objective is to make Christianity an integral part of the modern age without succumbing to the secular understandings of modernity A recent symbol of this was the Popes agreement to say mass for the crew of NBCs Today show and to allow portions of it to be televised In the Popes view modern television exists as part of modern culture it is inherently neither good nor evil the task of the Church is to integrate Christianity into this cultural form The Popes success with the mass media is especially important because one of the main problems the Catholic Church has confronted over the last few decades is the loss of control over its own means of communications Once the Church communicated to the faithful almost exclusively through its own channels its churches schools universities publications and the like Over the years however such means have declined in importance But the Pope by making himself and the papacy newsworthy events for the print and electronic news media and by getting the Vatican into such fields as video cassettes and satellite transmission has once again established contact with the masses The news media have also helped the Pope in his fights with his opponents Despite the fact that secular reports on the Church emphasize conflict  over liberation theology the ordination of women birth control  they almost always portray the Pope and his Vatican as facing scattered adversaries around the world It was once common for opponents of a given pope to lament him as a prisoner of the Curia the Vaticans administrative body John Paul has in many ways enhanced the power of the Vatican and has delegated much responsibility for administration Yet he is almost always criticized in his own name He is largely seen as the man in charge  and this is no small achievement WHEN JOHN PAUL II ASSUMED THE PAPAL OFFICE ON OCT 16 1978 HE found a Church and a papacy wracked by attacks from both the left and the right  a legacy of the turbulent 1960s and the revolutionary reforms of the Second Vatican Council Called by Pope John XXIII and held between 1962 and 1965 the council showed a new openness to the modern world It replaced the traditional Latin mass with a vernacular one it stressed church government by collegiality with the bishops it indicated a tolerance of other faiths Above all it raised expectations of a brave new age for the Church Throughout the 1960s and 70s the Catholic Church was challenged on three fronts First there was a growing openness on the part of some Catholics to Marxist thought The Rev Johannes B Metz of West Germany developed an explicitly political theology designed to testify to what he called the  marriage between salvation and world history His work inspired leftwing Christians around the world and was picked up most notably by the Rev Gustavo Gutierrez the Peruvian who coined the term theology of liberation and linked Father Metzs ideas with the notion of Latin American popular religion A result of the theory put into practice are the Christian base communities that have sprung up throughout Latin America The eras sexual revolution posed problems of a different order In its first wave the revolution flouted the Churchs teaching against premarital sex dismissed the notion that sexuality within marriage was to be linked with procreation and came close to sanctifying sexual satisfaction as a fundamental human right The second wave brought demands from women for an end to unjust discrimination in all spheres of life For a church that had always depended on a subordinate sisterhood this was a grave problem Finally at a time when practically all entrenched institutions and hierarchies were suspect the moral authority of the Church especially that of the pope was thrown into question The intellectual assault on the idea of papal infallibility  by the Rev Hans Kung and other dissident theologians  was symptomatic of a growing movement against the Churchs hierarchical structure Challenges to Catholic Church orthodoxy came from all sides For liberals Pope Paul VI gravely erred and alienated millions of Catholics with his 1968 encyclical proscribing artificial birth control Humanae Vitae Pope Paul further antagonized Church progressives by attempting to bring dissident theologians into line The traditionalists on the other hand saw Pope Pauls tenure as a dangerous period of drift and uncertainty and were alarmed that leftist economic ideas had become the Vatican norm In Latin America evangelical Protestantism was making serious inroads In the United States where Catholics had once been among the most ardent of Romes loyalists there were many signs of revolt and a sharp drop in church attendance D URING HIS SIX AND a half years as Pontiff John Paul II has accomplished what many in 1978 would not have thought possible the restoration of authority to the papacy and a clear sense of what the Church stands for The power to appoint is the power to rule and the Pope has used this power extensively and usually effectively The Vatican Curia has long been seen as a mysterious impenetrable bureaucracy that has run the Catholic Church regardless of who is pope I am only the Pope here John XXIII once told a group of friends But one of the rules of a bureaucracy is that those who preside over agencies can sometimes bend them to their will Pope John Paul has been operating on that premise In many ways he did not need to overcome the Curia at all he was elected in part because conservative Curialists saw him as the right man to enforce a vision of the Church they had long held This is so even if some Italians in the Curia do not share the Popes passion for Poland or are uncomfortable with his style John Pauls most important single appointment may be Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith the agency that supervises doctrinal issues The 58yearold West German has lamented the era since the Second Vatican Council as decidedly unfavorable for the Catholic Church a time when everything which is new or presumed new was preferred over what existed In a document released last fall Cardinal Ratzinger condemned the Marxist influence in liberation theology The document warned in words evocative of the Popes own experience in Poland against social movements that claim to speak in the name of the liberation of the people but produce regimes that keep whole nations in conditions of servitude that are unworthy of mankind Another important appointment is that of Jean Jerome Hamer a 68yearold Belgian who oversees the Congregation on Religious and Secular Institutes which regulates the religious orders He is a man ready to enforce the Popes clear views on the need for priests and nuns to maintain discipline and a distinct religious identity One of his most controversial acts involves an advertisement that appeared during the 1984 American Presidential campaign Put together by a group of liberal Catholics it declared that there was a diversity of opinion in the Catholic Church on abortion Archbishop Hamer has demanded a retraction from the 24 signers who belonged to religious orders So far only four  all men have retracted and the case is still pending The Pope is also changing the face of the Church hierarchy around the world In the United States for instance he appointed John J OConnor as Archbishop in New York and Bernard F Law as Archbishop in Boston Dubbed in Rome as Archbishops Law and Order they are seen as papal emissaries charged with leading the increasingly liberal American Church back to orthodoxy In Latin America the Popes allies are mostly conservatives like Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo of Colombia Cardinal Lopez Trujillo was appointed to the College of Cardinals in 1983 and he has been a tough local fighter against advocates of liberation theology In the Netherlands the Pope has reinforced the more conservative forces in the Church hierarchy to the consternation of the large number of Dutch liberals YET THE POPES OBJECtives cannot be neatly typecast He sought to shake the increasingly rebellious Jesuit order but he eventually backed off and allowed an election that produced a new superior general PeterHans Kolvenbach who has yet to establish a clear direction for the order Furthermore the second most important post in the Vatican is held by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli the Secretary of State who as architect of the Vaticans policy of detente toward the Soviet bloc holds views vastly different from those of Eastern European prelates including the Pope Vatican officials however argue that the Pope is aware that a strictly hardline policy toward Communist governments could endanger the limited maneuvering room the Church has in Eastern Europe Cardinal Casaroli therefore plays an essential complementary role Although he is a religious leader the Pope has been ready to intervene directly in what are finally political disputes He keeps in close touch with the Church leadership in his native Poland and suffers a steady barrage of attacks from Eastern European propagandists The Soviet Unions fear of the Pope is such that many believe the attempt on his life in 1981 was masterminded by the KGB His recent elevation of Nicaraguas antiSandinista Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo to the College of Cardinals sent a clear message to the Sandinistas So did the suspensions from priestly duties of the four Nicaraguan priests who hold Cabinet positions in the Sandinista Government The Pope appears to be enjoying a close relationship with American diplomats Reagan Administration officials have been granted frequent audiences with the Pope and an American Embassy to the Holy See was opened early last year The Pope in turn has often spoken warmly of Americas role in the world He was careful however to distance himself from President Reagans recent claim that the Pope had sent a message of support for the Reagan Administrations Central American policies Undermining all arguments that this is simply a conservative Polish Pope is the remarkable range of his radical statements about social injustice Earlier this year he began his visit to Peru with a warning against passing ideologies yet he ended it with a stop in the Lima slum of Villa el Salvador the scene of active organizing by Christian base communities There he praised the work of these communities and declared Never cease denouncing injustice The Pope often speaks of both capitalism and Marxism as forms of materialism He frequently asserts the priority of labor over capital warns against workers becoming slaves of the machine argues that private ownership carries the moral obligations of a social mortgage and condemns those who live in luxurious egoism while other sectors remain in poverty on the fringes and illiterate Not all of the Popes forays into politics are successful however In March a speech to Italian Church leaders was widely interpreted as an endorsement of the longdominant Christian Democratic Party To some Italian Catholics this was a divisive move in a Church seeking to heal internal wounds especially over politics The Popes decision to meet even briefly with farright members of the European Parliament including Frances racist and antiSemitic politician JeanMarie Le Pen drew much criticism Ultimately the Popes politics are antipolitical since he insists on personal redemption above all else This can be seen perhaps most clearly in his analysis of sin Leftwing Christians have introduced the idea of sinful structure that is economic and social institutions which by their nature perpetrate evil John Paul accepts the idea of sinful structures But he has turned the emphasis around worrying as he wrote last December that the structural argument leads more or less unconsciously to the watering down and almost abolition of personal sin It becomes too easy the Pope said to blame evil on some vague entity or anonymous collectivity such as the situation the system society structures or institutions Sin the Pope insisted is always a personal act The basis for many of these ideas is the Popes belief that Christs appearance on earth as God in human form allowed man to acquire full awareness of his dignity of the heights to which he is raised of the surpassing worth of his own humanity From this follows the Popes strong stand on human rights If the dignity of human beings comes directl from God then no mere human can violate it At bottom the Pope has said often he is calling not for revolution but individual conversion Change hearts he said in his message to young people earlier this year and you will change the world A T A NEWS CONFERence in February Archbishop Jozef Tomko a Slovak who is one of the most important figures in the Vatican began a sentence by speaking of men He suddenly stopped himself and smiled No thats not men  he said I meant men and women I dont want to see men in any stories Make sure its men and women  And he laughed The Archbishops caution reflects the fact that in some ways the protests of women are being heard in the Vatican The Pope himself has started using the men and women locution more often and has even included discrimination against women as one of the many evils the Church is committed to fighting The issues of sexuality and equality between the genders including the ordination of women as priests are issues that will severely test the Popes ability to lead American Catholics show no signs of following the Pope on birth control On abortion many Catholics agree with the moral position the Church upholds yet they cannot bring themselves to favor outright prohibition The sexual issues are part of broader questions about the extent to which it is possible for the Pope to impose hierarchical order on the increasingly independent national churches The Rev Philip Murnion heads the National Pastoral Life Center an organization that assists Catholic parishes and dioceses around the United States in conducting an effective Catholic ministry Father Murnion sees the potential for a clash between the hierarchical style of the Pope and the more eclectic and democratic style of the American Church On the sexual issues the American Church has tried to keep open the dialogue says Father Murnion On other matters such as war and economics the American bishops are consulting widely with Catholics of various points of view They see this process of consultation as a way of shoring up the Churchs teaching authority Its a different solution to the same problem Such issues will be thrashed out at an extraordinary synod of bishops in November called by the Pope to examine the results of the Second Vatican Council For more liberal Catholics a fear is that the synod will roll back the reforms of Vatican II More traditionalist Catholics however see the Pope as reaffirming the council itself while putting a stop to what they see as a destructive tendency to invoke the spirit of the council in support of every kind of experiment The argument in fact may turn on the questions of how fundamental the councils actions were and how much they were needed For liberals like Peter Steinfels editor of the American lay Catholic biweekly Commonweal the councils opening to the world was well worth the cost of the turbulence that followed In the 1930s Mr Steinfels says the Church may have been wellordered but that didnt keep it from compromising with Fascism in many nations Church people are now in the forefront of the struggle for human dignity from Eastern Europe to Latin America Some traditionalists as well including the Pope insist on the councils crucial role You can argue it many ways says the Rev Thomas Herron an official of the Vaticans Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith But can you imagine where the Church would have been in the 60s without the council I have to think that the damage would have been far worse Were the Churchs troubles following Vatican II selfinflicted wounds or simply the inevitable results of the conflicts of the 1960s and 70s Were they signs of vitality or decline Clearly one of the results of that period was an erosion of the Vaticans teaching authority and reclaiming it is one of John Pauls central objectives The theory much contested inside the Church is expressed as an aphorism by Joaquin NavarroValls the Vatican spokesman Authority is a guarantee of unity he says Authority is also a guarantee of truth Proponents of the view that a clear and unequivocal Church orthodoxy can only strengthen Roman Catholicism cite the signs of increased vocations to the priesthood The number of candidates worldwide has risen from 63000 in 1978 to 73000 in 1982 Moreover the Church is doing very well in the third world The Popes defenders say that a church that wants to expand had better be clear on what it believes They note that the Pontiffs mystical spirituality and his devotion to popular religion put him far more in touch with the religious aspirations of the worlds impoverished than are most intellectual Westerners For conservatives this period of clarification is essential The feeling of alienation that Vatican II produced has been lifted says James P McFadden chairman of the doctrinally conservative National Committee of Catholic Laymen and editor of New Yorks Catholic Eye a monthly newsletter Under John Paul II the feeling is that if you do something then by God something might happen    People understand that if you want to get ahead you should be like Law and OConnor The fact that the debate over papal authority continues suggests the limits of even the strongest leadership The Pope appears to understand such limits His very emphasis on his world travels suggests a tactical choice that it is easier and better to win new followers than to change the minds of those who oppose him And whatever else is true there can be no doubt that the Popes voice has become one of the strongest and loudest in the world W HAT DOES JOHN Paul II plan to do with this newfound influence In the first place he sees his very presence in Rome as a symbol of the integration of Eastern Europe with Europe as a whole He has long argued that the division of Europe along proWestern and proSoviet lines is artificial and has tended to cut off the Eastern bloc countries especially the Slavs  from the cultural patrimony they share with Western Europe This goal of a unified Europe explains his new emphasis on the ecumenical movement John Paul II is less concerned with ecumenical approaches to Protestant churches and sees his first task as bringing the Eastern Orthodox churches back into the some form of communion with Rome Those who know him say he believes that as the first Slavic Pope he has a special mission to achieve this But he is driven by other calculations as well One is demographics says Mr NavarroValls the Vatican spokesman given the enormous sweep of Orthodoxy throughout the Soviet Union Greece and the Middle East Politics is another factor since closer ties with Orthodoxy will create opportunities for Catholicism in the Soviet Union On theological grounds Orthodoxy is closer to Catholicism than Protestantism If anything the gap between Catholicism and the more liberal Protestant churches is growing Is this religious agenda matched by a specifically political one Clearly the Pope is seeking to expand the freedom of Catholics to operate inside the Soviet bloc he speaks often about the lack of religious freedom there and elsewhere And clearly the Church has given important support to the Solidarity movement in Poland In Latin America the Pope has moved to stem the influence of Marxism within Catholic movements for social change This has had at least some effect if only because events in the region most notably in Nicaragua are moving in directions the Pope might have predicted The Jesuit order dismissed the Rev Fernando Cardenal according to Jesuit priests in Rome partly because they feared the Sandinista Government was using and manipulating wellmeaning Catholics At a rhetorical level leaders of the Catholic left have begun to play down their explicit ties to Marxist thought But it is not yet clear how hard the Vatican will push the Latin American Catholic left or the extent to which this Pope wants a confrontation In the meantime the Pope has given his blessing to Latin Americas new democracies hoping that they will find a way around the polarization that has affected the Church as it has so many other institutions in Latin America With regard to the West those seeming contradictions crop up again A Pope who looks to the West to contain Communist power does not embrace the Wests dominant secular values He is manifestly worried about libertarian attitudes on sexual morality and turning back two decades of change will not be easy But taking the longer view the Pope seems to believe that societies have passed through periods of decadence before and that the Churchs task is to keep alive and spread the traditional values in preparation for a time when society will embrace them again This idea in many ways epitomizes John Pauls entire approach to the papacy For all the contradictions that the world might see in his message it is a remarkably clear and coherent world view It is a view that annoys even angers a large number of Catholics who believe the Church is in the process of abandoning a promising course laid down by John XXIII and Vatican II But for other Catholics this Pope is correcting abuses clarifying the Churchs course and preparing it for the third millennium He is a Pope who clearly takes seriously the warning in St Pauls first letter to the Corinthians For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle
NEW JERSEY OPINION;   NUMBERS GAME ON A HIGH LEVEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-numbers-game-on-a-high-level.html,ON THIS page on March 24 Sanford Weinreb assailed those state legislators who are supporting a Federal Constitutional Convention for the purpose of proposing an amendment that would mandate a balanced budget He called us irresponsible our position frightening and our attitude cavalier Mr Weinreb is executive director of the American Jewish Congresss New Jersey region which is based in East Orange As the prime sponsor of a resolution in the State Assembly to have New Jersey join the call for such a convention I am eager to answer Mr Weinrebs objections First some background The United States Constitution requires that Congress call a Constitutional Convention at the request of twothirds or 34 of the state legislatures Thirtytwo already have taken this action and several more have adopted resolutions in one house or the other This is a lot of activity and the reason for it is clear It reflects accurately the overwhelming public support for a Constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget The underlying facts are that the American people are dismayed at Washingtons continuing fiscal cowardice and are justifiably afraid of a coming catastrophe The responsibility for our national budget lies with Congress and the President however in spite of popular opinion it has become clear over the last few years that they simply will not keep Federal expenditures and income in a sane balance Maybe they cant Maybe as a practical political matter they are unable to do what they agree they should do in principle Over the past generation our Federal Government and most other democracies have reached the point where the pressure applied by a myriad of powerful special interests for spending programs and tax breaks has overwhelmed the general public interest in frugality American fiscal policy used to reflect an internal ethic You had to pay for what you bought No longer Now its fly now and pay later  and later and later Enormous political benefits are derived by Congressmen who support spending programs nothing but grief comes to those who try to keep expenditures in line with our ability to pay The result is a condition that everyone agrees we cannot sustain over the long haul But neither under the present political climate of high pressure on a weak Congress can we bring it to an end through the normal legislative process If we need a demonstration of the failure of Congress to act responsibly we have only to look at the current flailing about in Washington in the effort to keep the deficit for this year below 200 billion This is not just a transitory economic dispute it is a fundamental institutional failure of sufficient magnitude to require a Constitutional solution However the same selfinterest that keeps Congress from balancing the budget on its own also keeps it from embracing a balancedbudget amendment to the Constitution If our Representatives will not act then there is only one other force that can save us from fiscal disaster ourselves The Constitution gives us the means and quite properly it is a method so lengthy and difficult that only an issue of overwhelming importance would compel us to follow it That method involves a Constitutional Convention but it can succeed without a convention ever taking place I believe that if 33 or 34 states called for a convention Congress itself would then recommend its own balancedbudget amendment It would be forced to act Congress has no desire to see its power snatched away by a convention This happened once before in a similar situation In 1912 the 17th Amendment providing for the popular election of United States Senators was submitted to the states only after nearly twothirds of the states called for a Constitutional Convention on the subject In that case as in this members of Congress were unwilling to approve a reform that was not in their political selfinterest nevertheless they relented when the only alternative was a Constitutional Convention But even assuming for the sake of argument that a convention actually would occur the fears of Mr Weinreb and others are exaggerated A runaway convention taking up abortion school prayer and other issues poses virtually no danger Most state resolutions including mine strictly limit to a balancedbudget amendment the subject matter that may be considered at such a convention Most legal authorities agree that Congress itself could make the rules and limit the scope of a convention In fact Congress would certainly tilt the convention in any direction it cared to The ultimate protection against a runaway convention is that any amendment whether proposed by a convention or by Congress itself would have to be ratified by threefourths of the states From the experience with the proposed equal rights amendment we all know how difficult that is It is much easier to block an amendment than to ratify it If Congress wont live up to its responsibilities if its members cannot summon the internal discipline to keep our country from the edge of disaster then they need an external discipline a constitutional discipline like that imposed on the vast majority of state governments including New Jerseys Is this a dangerous game were playing Perhaps it is a kind of game But the reason were being forced to play it is that by refusing to put the nations fiscal house in order Congress is playing a far more dangerous game

Shaken and muted they find themselves asking How much longer and how much further can this rightist surge this latterday Thermidor go Probably not far Like liberals in their heyday the mid1960s Washingtons overconfident conservative cadres of the mid80s are beginning to overstate the perceptions and mindset in the rest of the country that helped fuel their rise No one should misunderstand Ronald Reagans basic firstterm commitments to curbing publicsector expansion rebuilding Americas weakened defenses and restoring a more traditional culture and morality were unmistakably ratified last November by 59 percent of the electorate just as the Democratic landslide of 1964 ratified the great liberal consolidation of the John F Kennedy years But 1984 may be a mirror image of 1964 in other ways as well Lyndon B Johnson an even bigger election victor than Ronald W Reagan interpreted his election as a mandate for a further major escalation of Governments social and economic role  the boldly labeled Great Society To large elements of the electorate however it was a status quo election rightly or wrongly Republican Barry M Goldwater appeared to reject both basic civil rights for blacks and the Social Security program The public wanted no such rollback but neither did it want the excesses in Government intervention that came with the Great Society Soon the electoral tides were reversed President Reagan may be embarking upon a comparable misinterpretation Two examples of overambition are particularly in evidence Most immediately apparent is the ideological combativeness and political ineptitude pervading the newly reorganized White House under chief of staff Donald T Regan and his director of communications Patrick J Buchanan Mandate hubris has helped nurture excesses from likening the Nicaraguan contras to Americas Founding Fathers to persisting in controversial plans to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg These would have been impossible to imagine in the more politic and diplomatic firstterm Reagan White House run by thenchief of staff now Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d Nor by any reasonable calculation can 1984 returns be read to endorse either a purist freemarket view of the economy or a dismantling of middleclass support programs  the total devotion to a handsoff Government policy in the domestic economy and international trade and the cutbacks in Social Security costofliving adjustments that the White House is now advocating That was evident in a February New York TimesCBS News Poll which showed a public fearful of the domestic rollbacks in the Presidents budget and overwhelmingly opposed to his insistence on reducing farm subsidies There is a growing sense among citizens out there beyond Washington of problems that require an affirmative Federal role  to compete with Japan for example or to strengthen our faltering educational system And there is a disquietude with some other elements of the second Reagan Administration including the continuing emphasis on fundamentalist religious goals and military spending Notwithstanding the election results of last fall these recent developments raise doubts about the future of the conservative ascendancy in America And history too suggests we may be at a political turning point Electoral tides and ideological tides do not necessarily run parallel A President and his party can win reelection even as the nations needs are about to shift drastically Arthur M Schlesinger Jr the historian has plausibly argued that even within the generational party supremacies of United States history there have been shorter alternating philosophic cycles Periods of conservatism and consolidation have been followed by bursts of activism and expansive government Another such change may be on the horizon B ACK IN THE LATE 1970S the notion of excessive Government intervention in the economy had become a cliche symbolized by cartoons of cowboys riding the range with their horses staggering under federally mandated safety equipment Governments inability to finetune the economy went hand in hand with Governments inability to finetune human nature Busing couldnt soothe hostile cultures and neighborhoods Nor could welfarism expunge a basic social and economic reality that any viable philosophy of governance simply has to maintain an income and ego gap between the gainfully employed lowermiddleclass and the nonworking poor These mistaken directions stand reversed after four years of Ronald Reagan and clear electoral accolades were delivered last November However an Administration whose insistence on the marketplace and diminished Government was valid five years ago now suffers from ideological hardening of the arteries At its extremes leaving national affairs to the marketplace is arguably as out of kilter with the realities of interest groups nationalism and human behavior as liberal regulatory utopianism was in its own selfindulgent heyday Yet in the months since his triumphant second inaugural the President has been escalating not modifying old themes The states are once again the sovereign states Government is an albatross a burden on progress  and our allies should begin to restore their own economies by stripping away layers of government as we are doing Through November talk like this could to some degree be discounted as campaign rhetoric Partly because of our revolutionary beginnings and frontier experiences Americans accept Government less willingly than most other peoples and populist reaction against governing national elites has been a mainstay of political realignments from Thomas Jeffersons era to our own Even Franklin D Roosevelt later to preside over American historys greatest expansion of Federal authority assailed hapless incumbent Herbert C Hoover for being committed to the idea that we ought to center control of everything in Washington as rapidly as possible Roosevelt changed course soon enough The burden of ruling creates a different reality the obligation either to develop or come to terms with a new positive role for Government Even Thomas Jeffersons reluctant early 19thcentury Democrats eventually came to accept most of the activist tenets of Alexander Hamiltons Federalists Ronald Reagan is all but unique in maintaining his antiGovernment commitment into the fifth year of his Presidency The Presidents wish list for diminishing Governments economic role is a long one Movement toward a flat tax to strip away political and social objectives built into the Internal Revenue Code Reduction of Federal assistance programs and the use of cash vouchers for schools and housing Substitution of enterprise zones for Federal economic development programs Acceptance of free trade as a mechanism for reallocating who does what in the global economy Interest in a gold standard to eliminate Governments role in managing the currency And for the most part free fluctuation of the dollar in the world market with minimal official intervention no matter what the pain to American manufacturers and farmers trying to sell their goods abroad The problem alas is that there can be too much of a good thing The Presidents program could have serious consequences for conservatism in America particularly given the new state of mind among many Democrats The results of November 1984 seem to have become the cultural chastening election that liberal Democrats refused to perceive in the defeats of 1968 1972 and 1980 At long last many of them seem to be facing up to the American electorates fundamental rejection of a leadership mode keyed to minority groups dissidents and proponents of cultural exotica Senator Edward M Kennedy for example has spoken of the need to change public perceptions of his party as being hostage to the demands of particular groups If Democratic and liberal politicians do indeed shift away from their old unproductive course they could minimize what has been a major ingredient of conservative and Republican success these last two decades More to the point in doing so they could also deal with a root cause of the post1965 public disenchantment with Government  its overambitious use for impractical or unacceptable causes Meanwhile circumstances that call for some form of Government intercession the old Democratic rallying cry are multiplying Americas jeopardized agriculture eroded manufacturing competitiveness rundown transportation infrastructure shaky financial institutions and troubled educational system may be about to force Washingtons hand Conservatives themselves are divided Many businessmen and Republican politicians are just as actionmotivated as Democratic officeholders and theorists Concern about the record United States trade deficit and Japanese mercantilism has led group after group adviser after adviser to plead with the President for more Government commitment and involvement Consider The Presidents Commission on Industrial Competitiveness headed by John Young of the HewlettPackard Company called this year for the establishment of new Federal departments of international trade and science and technology Late last year the Presidents Task Force on International Private Enterprise headed by Dwayne Andreas chief executive officer of the ArcherDanielsMidland Company recommended expanding the Federal ExportImport Bank and creating a White House Economic Security Council In the meantime such organizations as the BusinessHigher Education Forum and the Business Roundtable have called for new efforts and commitments to strengthen the American education system especially in science and mathematics Unhappily though there is a spreading fear in sophisticated corporate circles that freemarket abstractionists in the Reagan Administration are simply not listening Congressional and state Republican politicians do not share White House hostility to creative Government Senate and House Republican task forces have published and promoted agendas for industrial competitiveness Their goal not counterproductive Government intervention but the enlistment of Washington as industrys ally against foreign businessGovernment partnerships In New Jersey and Illinois Republican Governors have been the authors of bold new approaches to repairing Americas declining transportation infrastructure Governors Edward D DiPrete of Rhode Island and Dick L Thornburgh of Pennsylvania are advocates of state industrial strategies Governors John H Sununu of New Hampshire and George Deukmejian of California have begun major education initiatives C ONSERVATIVES WHO reluctantly accept such intercessions on the state level but reject them as directions for Federal expansion are probably kidding themselves These activities are bound to increase at the Federal level over the next decade The emerging question is Under what political and ideological aegis Modern conservatisms ability to manage a new round of Governmental innovation not the previous bureaucratic overintervention but new involvements and objectives focused by todays changed requirements  is anything but clear Pragmatism may be strong in the business community and among elected Republican officeholders but there is a strong counterforce Ideologically committed people who finally obtain real power after being spurned for decades have a tendency to excess  to believe that their particular insights and perceptions can explain and achieve virtually everything And that seems to hold for President Reagan himself In the Presidents case his commitment to the idea of restoring American greatness by stripping back the role of Government useful in 1980 is being carried to excess  and in a way that may jeopardize Republican consolidation as the nations governing party Reaganite thinkers like to insist that theirs is a new wave with little relation to previous Republican politics and ideology The case can be made however that what we are seeing now is the last great crest of a much older political wave a conservative or more appropriately nonliberal national era that began some 17 or 18 years ago and is now in late middle age The watershed year was not 1980 but 1968 Since then the Republicans have won four out of five Presidential elections three by obvious landslides Major realigning elections seem to occur every 28 to 36 years  in 1800 1828 1860 1896 and 1932 Another was due around 1968 and it came The five realignment periods all shared a common pattern in each case the party newly ascending to power invariably controlled the White House for at least 16 of the first 20 years following the watershed and such 16to20year party hegemonies have occurred only in these circumstances By January 1989 the Republicans will have controlled the Presidency for 16 of the previous 20 years One facet of all this that has confused many political scientists is that it has occurred only on the Presidential or nationalissue level In point of fact Democratic predominance in governorships and legislatures  and even in the House of Representatives  is little changed from the levels of the late 1950s and 60s Watergate I think was a decisive warpfactor Without the unfolding scandals autumn impact on the 1972 elections Richard M Nixon should have won 63 to 64 percent of the vote against George S McGovern instead of 61 percent and the Republicans should have gained 1 or 2 Senate seats and 25 House seats instead of losing 2 Senate seats and capturing only 12 House seats Thus invigorated a RepublicanSouthern Democratic coalition might well have negotiated control of Congress And so bolstered a second Nixon Administration might well have precipitated a fair part of the ideological reorientation of Washington that Watergate postponed until the Reaganite 1980s Certainly the Republican Partys 196872 Southern Strategy antedated Reagans by a decade and the regional Protestant fundamentalist ethnic and racial contours of Nixons 1972 victory all closely foreshadowed those of Reagans 1984 triumph But it was not to be the Nixon Administration could not provide a framework for an evolutionary conservative future The postWatergate climate of moral and political exorcism created a flukish opportunity for the election of a trust me Georgia Democratic Sundayschool teacher Jimmy Carter And when the Republicans returned to power after his failure it was a radicalized conservatism that took charge Watergate had transferred power rightward within the Republican Party while the governmental failures of the late 1970s had created a climate of national frustration A similar and significant development in Britain sheds some light on the American phenomenon The key arguably is that Britain and the United States are two Western nations with pioneering freemarket economies that once dominated the world  in short countries with an unmatched ripeness for the political economics of nostalgia A decade ago both nations watched middleclass centerright politicians Richard M Nixon and Edward Heath give way to oppositionparty tenures When those alternatives in turn proved unsuccessful conservatism in both countries reemerged in a much bolder posture On both sides of the Atlantic the new conservatism was a radicalized nostalgiaflavored variety conjoining a rugged individualism and freemarket commitment that verge on economic Darwinism with an intermittently populist attitude toward elites and a commitment to restoring traditional values and national greatness Not surprisingly the Reagan Administrations institutional expression of these diverse psychologies has been more than a little contradictory The Presidents ideology deemphasizes Governments economic role but reemphasizes Governments role in upholding military prowess and traditional religion There was a logic in this reversal in 1980  a better balance did have to be restored  but its persistence today is beginning to raise political questions With the Pentagons budget continuing to swell despite fiscal crisis Gallup polls now show the lowest public support for increasing defense spending since 1971 Similarly White House commitment to mobilizing the suasion of Government to advance prayer and to oppose abortion is indisputable  and controversial One can even find contexts in which the Administrations two dimensions of commitment merge Several months ago the President quoted the Gospel according to Luke 143132 to justify his defense budget and columnist Richard Reeves has reported how members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been urging audiences to enlist in Gods Army or blaming the 1983 suicide bombing of American soldiers in Lebanon on the forces of the Antichrist Such episodes if the President himself were not so easygoing would be more suggestive of a modernday Oliver Cromwellism than of traditional or Tory conservatism Indeed the new political prominence of television evangelists along with assorted economic panaceamongers actually underscores how what we now label conservatism actually draws heavily on yesteryears radical streams of the American electorate  the old populist precincts of the South and West tax insurgents religious fundamentalists and the like Elements of the supplyside wing of the Republican Party openly boast of their economic radicalism Revolutions against the status quo are routinely proclaimed For the immediate future to be sure the conservative tent is where the action is But the future is ambiguous by what dynamics can conservatism continue to encompass populists Tories libertarians ordinary middleclass Americans religious fundamentalists farmers and freemarket philosophers Im skeptical Maintaining the operational compatibility of radicalism Yuppieism and conservatism will be increasingly tricky  particularly while the old liberalism is becoming so weak a bogeyman To cite one central predicament the Administrations pursuit of Moral Majoritytype issues probably inevitable given both Ronald Reagans own convictions and the very real grassroots strength of the religious right is likely to offend youthful and socially permissive even libertarian constituencies One Reagan campaign official recently acknowledged that back in October when Democratic television advertising castigated the Republicans as the party of the Moral Majoritys leader Jerry Falwell Reagan support among 18 to 24yearold voters plummeted 20 points in 5 days A Florida politicalscience professor William S Maddox coauthor of a new book on political labels contends that what we are really seeing among the young is not a conservative renaissance but a liberal libertarian split And libertarianleaning Reagan youth he thinks are likely to flee at the sight of a revival tent on the White House lawn Nor is the White House likely to impress the electorate with the sort of tactical bungling and rhetorical extremism so apparent in the uproar over the Presidents recent comments on Nicaragua and the Bitburg cemetery affair It is sadly an old pattern After winning a second term by a landslide margin Presidents and their staffs become too convinced they can do no wrong Good judgment goes out the window Franklin Roosevelt lost momentum after trying to pack the Supreme Court less than a year after his 1936 landslide and Richard Nixons 49state sweep in 1972 nurtured a false illusion that he could cover up Watergate The recent hubris in the White House suggests something similar could be happening again Yet the Administrations most precarious overreaching may lie in its increasingly militant insistence on upholding freemarket economics and curbing middleclass support programs In the abstract fiscal conservatism commands an enormous acceptance In recent weeks however this acceptance has been offset by a counterreaction a growing sense that the Administration is not so much exercising careful judgment as indulging an ideological relentlessness Budget Director David A Stockmans expressions of disdain for farmers and military pensioners helped set the scene Commentators and analysts are beginning to conjure up a new era of Social Darwinism in which the Government shrinks its economic and social role in favor of a survival of the fittest If the critics are correct all this may be jeopardizing our system  and conservatisms future as well Deregulation of industry they charge has been a bonanza for upperincome consumers of financial services mainroute airline flights and longdistance telephone service but a disaster for the rural and urban lowerincome groups The overvaluation of the dollar has devastated American farms and factories Tax cuts and deregulation of financial services have shifted wealth toward the upper brackets Debt and speculation are threatening the security of Americas financial system Cutbacks in social services have hurt the poor and now threaten the middle class Sociologists are even beginning to theorize that radical individualism has run away with the national psyche America is what we watch on television the glittering dogeatdog world of Dallas Dynasty and Falcon Crest Of course periodic doses of laissezfaire and Darwinism demonstrably benefit a nation Even hostile economists admit that the rampant capitalism of the late 19th century Robber Baron years and of the Roaring Twenties did unleash a lot of economic creativity and energy So did the marketplace emphasis of the late 1970s and early 80s But these policies can only be productive up to a point and now they could be unsettling the economy in a way not entirely unlike the handsoff euphoria of the Coolidge years My own sense is that Americas mood is getting ready to shift toward an affirmative role for Government again and conservatism may not have much more time to come up with a positive program framework The Reagan Administrations current programs even if packaged with oomph under a conservative opportunity society label are really just different vehicles for a common attempt to reduce governments role Blueprinting a new affirmative role constitutes an altogether different challenge  and if global economic circumstances are as precarious as many observers fear that challenge may soon be upon us In fact alternation between individualism and communityoriented Government activism is an old rhythm of American politics Liberals may be too numbed by their recent electoral fate to weigh the cyclical lessons of history but conservatives cannot afford to be cocky Weak as the opposition may now appear the public is unlikely to dwell on its failed past beyond another year or two And if conservatives do not develop their own affirmative agenda for coping with the crises in agriculture basic industry finance international commerce education and urban decay then in all likelihood electoral support will begin shifting elsewhere
"POPE, ON DUTCH TRIP, FIRMLY CALLS FOR CHURCH UNITY",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/world/pope-on-dutch-trip-firmly-calls-for-church-unity.html,Pope John Paul II today began his pilgrimage to the Netherlands and its divided Roman Catholic Church with firm calls for unity and fidelity to Rome warning that freedom cannot be abused The Pope issued his warning as he embarked on the 26th foreign journey of his sixandahalfyearold pontificate and in the eyes of Vatican officials his most difficult Speaking on arrival at the Eindhoven Airport he called upon Dutch Catholics  among the most liberal Catholics in the world on such issues as married priests the ordination of women and independence from Rome  not to distance themselves from the center of the unity of the church Archbishop Adriaan Simonis the Dutch Catholic Primate said at the welcoming ceremony that the Dutch were going through the same spiritual crisis which is affecting the whole of the Western world He said he hoped that during the Popes visit Dutch Catholics would demonstrate their attachment to the Holy See Says Freedom Can Be Abused Later in a homily at St Johns Cathedral in Hertogenbosch near here the Pope praised the Dutch as a people who love their freedom But he warned that freedom could be abused When freedom does not have a purpose he said when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women when it does not listen to the voice of conscience it turns against humanity and society John Paul who is doctrinally conservative has rarely faced such intense opposition as exists here On Friday the Vatican Radio said the Popes visit would be delicate and anything but easy Extremist groups have put up posters in Amsterdam urging riots during the visit and offering a reward for the Popes assassination A demonstration by liberal Catholic groups this week drew thousands of people Public opinion polls have shown that relatively few Dutch Catholics welcome the visit Today the Federation of the Netherlands Trade Union Movement gave reporters an open letter to the Pope criticizing his stands on Nicaragua abortion and feminism 55 Million Dutch Catholics There are 55 million Dutch Catholics just under 40 percent of the population The church here has been deeply divided by the changes spurred by the 1960s and by the Second Vatican Council which ended in 1965 In the 1960s and early 1970s the Dutch church experimented with decentralized democratic administration and many of its leaders endorsed such concepts as allowing priests to marry ordaining women legitimizing homosexuality and changing the churchs opposition to artificial birth control The Vatican however has cracked down on this liberal spirit and John Paul has consistently appointed conservatives to replace more liberal church leaders These appointments have usually engendered intense local opposition as did his naming in February of Johannes ter Schure a staunch conservative as Bishop of Hertogenbosch Critics say the Pope has consistently ignored the advice of local church leaders John Paul spoke of this in his homily today In a rare public defense of papal decision making he said he attempts to understand the life of the local church in the appointment of every bishop A Sentence Is Dropped He gathers information and obtains advice in accordance with eccesiastical law and custom he continued You will understand that opinions are sometimes divided In the end the Pope has to take the decisions Vatican officials said the Pope had dropped some phrases from his original text In one such omission he said in reference to the Popes appointments of bishops Must he explain his choice Discretion does not permit him to do so John Paul was warmly greeted by the crowds that met him and in Hertogenbosch a procession wound its way through the citys eightcenturyold streets The crowds were smaller than organizers had expected There were few protesters visible along the papal route But a group of several hundred young people many in punk dress marched in Utrecht and later burned an effigy of the Pope Worries About Independence In his arrival remarks the Pope alluded to his concern that liberal Dutch Catholics will become so independent of the Vatican and its teachings as to become nearly a separate church The vitality of the local churches he declared increases or is revived to the extent that they do not become shut up in themselves and do not distance themselves from the unity of the church Defending the papacy he said Jesus had set St Peter himself at the head of the other apostles In response to Dutch Catholics who want lay people to assume more responsibilities now held by priests he said Christ desired a structure in which priests are charged with leading the people of God to the exalted goal for which they are striving The stop in the Netherlands was the first on a 10day trip that will also take the Pope to Belgium and Luxembourg Speaking to reporters on the flight from Rome John Paul referred to his Dutch journey as a normal trip and said he was not worried about the controversy he would face There have always been challengers he said They challenged St Paul and they challenged Jesus Himself
"IDEAS & TRENDS (CONTINUED);   IN CHINA THESE DAYS, AN ONLY CHILD IS THE ONLY WAY",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/weekinreview/ideas-trends-continued-in-china-these-days-an-only-child-is-the-only-way.html,When Han Xu Chinas newly appointed Ambassador to the United States was asked last month about the problems that divide the two countries import limits on Chinese textiles and American arms sales to Taiwan were high on his list Mr Han did not even mention another difference one on which an understanding with the Reagan Administration is perhaps the most remote of all The issue is population control and Chinas determined efforts to achieve it For five years with a severity that contrasts with his more relaxed approach on other matters the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has imposed a limit of one child to a family The measures he has authorized to enforce that policy have been denounced as coercive and even brutal by Administration officials indeed the United States has cut 10 million from its grant to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities the amount the fund expects to spend on birth control here this year Pekings direct response to this aid cutback was limited to a statement expressing deep regret from the family planning minister Wang Wei who blamed the United States action on distorted reports and rumors in the American press Standing Firm A more forceful if oblique reaction came from Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang who took the occasion of the United Nations Population Conference in Peking late last month to reaffirm the onechild policy Our work in family planning is getting better every year he told Rafael M Salas director of the United Nations fund Mr Salas tried unsuccessfully to convince the Reagan Administration which refuses to finance any familyplanning efforts that promote abortion that not one cent of United Nations money goes toward abortions in China Figures released by Peking at the conference furnished fresh ammunition for both sides Mr Wang the minister told delegates from 18 Asian nations that in 1984 the Chinese growth rate  the number of births minus the number of deaths  was 108 per thousand only slightly higher than the goal of 10 per thousand set when the onechild policy was imposed in 1979 Chinese officials contend that meeting the target and holding to it for the rest of the century will mean that the population will peak at 12 billion an increase of 192 million from 1984 If accurate the figures reflect a stringency that will do little to allay Washingtons concerns According to the statistics Chinas growth rate was 285 per thousand in 1965 when Mao Zedong was declaring that an everlarger population was a good thing A decade later after a twochild limit had been recommended the figure fell to 157 By 1981 well into the Deng policy it was down to 145 By continuing to push toward the 10 per thousand goal the Government succeeded in eliminating about 20 million births from 1981 through 1984 Even if half that number could be attributed to better family planning  doubtful say many Western experts because Peking has reported that only 30 million women use the birth control pill  China would still lead the world in abortions Peking officials say that family planning is strictly voluntary and that abortion is only provided at the request of the woman after contraceptive failure or for health reasons But most Western diplomats and experts consider the Chinese statements true only by an Orwellian definition of voluntarism Unfriendly Persuasion If a decision made in the face of relentless pressure and threats can be said to be voluntary they say the women of China have a choice It is only the bravest or most stubborn women or those who are successful in disguising their condition who can carry a second child to term in the areas where the onechild limit is most systematically enforced the cities and towns where about a fifth of the population lives Last year a British television crew filmed the process of persuasion endured by one woman First the elderly women of the granny police deputized as voluntary enforcers discovered that the woman was pregnant for a second time When their entreaties failed to persuade her to have an abortion the local authorities stepped in Only after her familys livelihood was threatened did the woman and her husband cave in The story ended with her tearful entry into a clinic where she had an abortion at seven months In theory the policy relies mainly on incentives Couples signing a onechild pledge get priority in housing and medical care among other benefits But increasingly Government pressure has involved punitive tactics Travelers in several provinces have encountered couples who lost their jobs or were fined for refusing to agree to abortions In Yunnan province in the southwest fines of up to 700  a familys annual income in many cases  have been reported Some women manage to have a second child by bribing officials or by going into hiding for the last months of pregnancy Among couples desperate for a son infanticide or abandonment of infant girls is a common enough problem for warnings of the penalties  prison terms but usually not death  to be posted The best that human rights observers can say about the onechild policy is that it is unevenly applied Second children are common in some rural counties With the ethnic minorities there has been a tendency to allow larger families at least to a second child Peking is sensitive to any suggestion that its policies suppress minority populations And Vietnamese refugees of Chinese origin have gotten away with having large families sometimes up to 10 children a privilege that has caused some resentment among the dominant Han Chinese In spite of his population policy Mr Deng has ridden the prosperity fostered by his economic reforms to a peak of popularity unequaled by a Chinese leader since Mao led the Communists to victory in 1949 In the cities many young Chinese say they accept the argument that the country can never modernize so long as half or more of the growth in the gross national product is eaten away by population increases as occurred in the 30 years before 1979 Yet even some of the sympathizers see a potential danger They worry that the hardliners who oppose Mr Dengs economic policies may some day accuse him of sacrificing future generations to his bourgeois goals an interpretation that could find a ready response among those denied the large families that are traditional in China
CUOMO TELLS GRADUATES TO BE POLITICALLY ACTIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/13/nyregion/cuomo-tells-graduates-to-be-politically-active.html,Governor Cuomo exhorted graduating students at the University of Rochester today to become involved in the countrys political system and pointed to the example of South Africas Nobel laureate Bishop Desmond M Tutu Unless people like you give us a new generation willing to take on the challenge of selfgovernment willing to accept its responsibilities to reform it to change it to make it fairer and more responsive  unless you do Mr Cuomo said in the schools 135th commencement address the very rich will get richer the poor will become fired in their desperation violence will increase and here as in so many places around the world the purpose of government will be reduced basically to a matter of maintaining order instead of improving conditions Before the Governor spoke Bishop Tutu addressed the 2201 degree candidates on behalf of all black South Africans thanking Americans and college students particularly for the spreading protests against apartheid on campuses across the country It isnt given to many of us to say that we know that were speaking on behalf of millions without being presumptuous said the 1984 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and a leader in the struggle of South African blacks against apartheid Expresses Gratitude However Bishop Tutu said he was speaking on behalf of many who had wished to be here on their own behalf to thank you  the people of this country students on several campuses  who have said by your demonstrations against apartheid by your education for action to be taken to exert pressure on the South African government to bring about change  you are saying you care You care that Gods children have their noses rubbed in the dust simply and solely because of a biological irrelevance the color of their skin On behalf of all those many many who are the victims of a policy that is one of the most vicious the world has seen since Naziism you say you care the Bishop said Bishop Tutu was invited to speak at the university by the Rev Hays Rockwell the rector of St James Episcopal Church at 865 Madison Avenue near East 72d Street in Manhattan who is a university trustee and a friend of the Bishop The Bishops address came only days before the Cuomo administration is expected to release a report analyzing whether New York should remove state funds from banks that do business in South Africa Much of the talent here Mr Cuomo said looking out over the sea of graduates in the Eastman Theater much of your enormous potential will go into the world of business of science of law or academics and in the process bring new strengths new improvements to our society But there will probably be no similar commitment to our political process  even if just at the level of voting or advocating And Im afraid well pay a price for this In fact I think that disinterest in politics is already affecting us negatively and pervasively Mr Cuomo has greatly increased the number of commencement addresses he will give according to Leslie Stern an aide from just two last year to 11 this year including speeches at some of the most prestigious universities in the country Once again Mr Cuomo has decided not to speak at any public colleges or universities despite invitations this year from three campuses of the State University of New York and the City University of New York The Governors speech writer Peter Quinn said that Mr Cuomo who is widely regarded as a future contender for the Democratic presidential nomination sees this series of commencement addresses as direct results of three speeches that are regarded as the most significant representations of his philosophy of governance and morality a speech at the University of Notre Dame reflecting on the question of abortion the keynote address to the Democratic National Convention last summer and a speech at Yale University earlier this year  These were the recipients of honorary degrees today GOVERNOR CUOMO Governor of New York State Doctor of Laws for statesmanship characterized by thoughtfulness and deep

DUTCH CATHOLICS CRITICIZE THE POPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/13/world/dutch-catholics-criticize-the-pope.html,Pope John Paul II ran into a storm of criticism when he met Dutch Catholics today while riot policemen clashed with demonstrators outside protesting his visit The Pope on the second day of his visit to the Netherlands was criticized by Dutch Catholics favoring more liberal church policies on womens rights and sexual issues In the streets while wellwishers substantially outnumbered demonstrators the violence was the worst in any of the Popes 26 foreign journeys In one incident protesters threw rocks and bottles at the Popes car At least 8 people were injured including 3 policemen and 14 were arrested Cheered at Mass The Pope seemed weary but unruffled and was greeted at an indoor mass this evening by a cheering crowd of about 20000 Both the demonstrations and the questions at the official ceremonies reflected the substantial opposition to John Paul from Dutch liberals and leftists both inside and outside the church Dutch Catholics are among the most liberal in the world and large segments of the church have distanced themselves from Rome and its teachings The Pope essentially ignored the demonstrations and criticism and continued to reiterate traditional Catholic teaching including the commitment of religious orders to poverty chastity and obedience The Pope faced his internal Catholic opposition during frank encounters at morning services and meetings Helwig Wasser an official of a Catholic missionary group departed from her prepared text to criticize the church asking if it could preach effectively if we lay down the law rather than extend a helping hand Teachings on Sexual Issues She also asked whether Catholicism could be credible if we exclude rather than make room for unmarried people living together divorced people homosexuals married priests and women Developments in the church in recent months have forced many of us because of our faith in and obedience to Christ to be critical and disobedient towards the Church said Mrs Wasser who is married and the mother of three children The street clashes followed a generally peaceful demonstration against the Pope by hundreds of young people some of them bearing the pink triangle symbol of homosexual rights groups and signs denouncing John Paul The crowd  estimated by the police at 1500 and by others at about 3000 included many in brightlydyed punk haircuts and a substantial homosexual contingent Women dressed as nuns danced and men in mock bishops robes bestowed blessings along the demonstrators winding route crisscrossing the citys main canal Rocks Eggs and Smoke Bombs I dont agree with the ideas the Pope has said Faurke van Halteran a 26yearold psychology graduate student Especially about what people should do and not do Especially about sex The demonstrators chanted fierce antiPope slogans some of them obscene and at one point sang Kill the Pope to the tune of a rock song The marchers were stopped by the police about a mile from where John Paul was speaking Some of the demonstrators began pelting the police with rocks eggs and smoke bombs Most of the demonstrators gradually dispersed but a fringe group continued the fighting and small groups of protesters regrouped to march this evening Chief Jan Wiarda of the Utrecht police said at a news conference tonight that the police had found two bags of gasoline bombs and that police officers had fired gunshots at least twice during the day He said it was not known if the shots  three in all  had hit anyone Crowds Break Windows Demonstrators most of whom were kept about a mile away from the Pope smashed windows damaged cars and threw rocks firecrackers and smokebombs at the police Chief Wiarda said protesters had also jammed the police radio with a satirical song about the Pope The two shooting incidents occurred in separate parts of town said Chief Wiarda The first he said occurred when a plainclothesofficer making arrests was attacked with a knife The policeman fired a shot and Chief Wiarda said the attacker escaped Nobody has communicated to us that he was shot by a policeman the police chief said The second incident came when a police car was attacked by a crowd he said The car was damaged and the driver was attacked he went on The policeman drew his gun and fired two shots in the air and the attackers fled Popes Vehicle Attacked Demonstrators threw bottles and rocks at the Popes enclosed car as he drove on a main thoroughfare later in the day Nothing struck the car as he rode past a generally friendly crowd of several thousand The Pope has drawn relatively small crowds here in part many Dutch Catholics have said because of the fear of street demonstrations Such fears also led organizers to schedule many events indoors Public opinion polls have found substantial numbers of Dutch Catholics either opposed or indifferent to John Pauls visit Mrs Wassers remarks at the Popes meeting with missionary organizations at the Royal Netherlands Trade Fair building here were greeted by a mixture of cheers and boos themselves a reflection of the divided Dutch Catholic Church Mrs Wasser who is active in several Catholic groups said she did not include her critical remarks in a prepared text because she feared that conservative Catholic officials would make her cut them out Church officials had barred some Catholics who have strongly opposed the Popes views from expressing their views at todays meetings Even Mrs Wassers prepared remarks included implicit criticisms of the Popes positions She praised base communities organizations often inspired by the theology of liberation as an appropriate way of making new disciples for Christ Pope Warns of Mission In his reply John Paul did not refer directly to her questions but warned that the evangelical mission of the Church must not be reduced to the provision of social and economic help alone nor should it become entangled with it At another session Marika Venhorst who was introduced as a feminist told the Pope that the church is not only the business of men The good ideas of women are not sufficiently taken into account she said adding that women should be able to participate be part of the thinking and also be able to take responsibility in the church The ordination of women as priests is one of the many issues where liberal Dutch Catholics have clashed with Rome In this case too John Paul declined to reply specifically You will understand that it is not possible to enter into a dialogue on the main subjects raised by the critics he said But in his addresses in the course of the day the Pope made clear that he was not altering his message to suit liberal Dutch audiences At a meeting of priests he reiterated his condemnation of abortion Presentday society calls for a particularly firm commitment from men of good will to defend life from its first flowering in the mothers womb to the last heartbeat he said
"CHURCH TEACHINGS ON SEX WON'T CHANGE, POPE TELLS DUTCH YOUTHS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/15/world/church-teachings-on-sex-won-t-change-pope-tells-dutch-youths.html,Pope John Paul II who has been trailed by young protesters in his four days in this country responded today to what he called blunt criticisms by rejecting calls for changes in Roman Catholic sexual rules The churchs teaching on sexual issues he said will remain the same for all time In a speech before one of the smallest crowds ever seen on a papal trip the Pope told several hundred young people at an outdoor meeting here that their criticisms sometimes give us old people problems Sometimes you hurt us said the 64yearold Pope who has faced fierce protests during his visit including stone and bottlethrowing But he said the church had no choice but to insist on strict rules and make unpalatable pronouncements The churchs teachings on marital love abortion sexual relations before or outside marriage or homosexual relations he said remain the standard for the church for all time Loyalty to High Ideals It would indeed be easier to mouth generalities John Paul declared But sometimes in accordance to what the Gospel teaches he said the church must be loyal to high ideals even if in so doing it opposes current attitudes Dutch Catholics are considered among the most liberal in the world and the Popes speech addressed the overwhelming rejection of the churchs sexual teachings by the young people of the Netherlands The small crowd of perhaps 750 to 1000 was a reflection of the problems the church faces here Ive never seen anything like it said a Vatican official who has been on 23 of the Popes 26 foreign trips Asked if he had ever seen a smaller crowd at such a papal event the official replied Frankly not The Rev Louis von Belkom a Dutch priest and schoolteacher who attended the rally said that while the size of the crowd reflected organizational difficulties it was also a sign of the churchs problems among the young Young people he said are not rejecting the church Its indifference he said and thats more dangerous Outdoor Mass in the South The Pope who is to leave Wednesday for Luxembourg traveled here after saying the only outdoor mass of his Dutch visit in an open field outside of Maastricht a southern city near the Belgian and West German borders The area is the nations Catholic heartland in contrast with the heavily Protestant and secularized northern part of the country The region of rolling hills and industrial towns is also more sympathetic to John Pauls traditionalist brand of Catholicism and organizers had hoped the mass would be a show of support for the Pope The crowd  estimated by officials at 25000 to 40000  was the largest that the Pope has drawn here But the attendance in blustery weather fell far short of the 100000 that organizers had hoped for In his sermon the Pope defended the churchs opposition to divorce and artificial birth control and urged Dutch politicians to recognize the family as the basis of society and not to make too many concessions to forces that would undermine family life Pope Responds to Questions The Popes unusual speech to young people came in response to a series of prearranged questions read by a spokesman In one of the questions the spokesman said that many young people feel that the church does not understand contemporary problems and proceeded to list virtually all the basic sexual teachings of the church including bans on extramarital and premarital sex and on homosexuality Young people the spokesman said ask themselves whether Jesus would not be considerably gentler with these people and their problems with the church The Pope replied flatly that the early Christians who were taught by those who had known Jesus personally were certainly not permissive John Paul asked if it would be realistic to imagine a Jesus who is indulgent on sexual issues Indulgence does not make people happy the Pope said The consumer society does not make people happy either If the church makes unpalatable pronouncements it is because it is obliged to do so the Pope declared It does so from honesty Being a Christian he said at another point has never been an easy choice and it never will be But the Pope insisted that he welcomed the criticisms of the young You more than anyone are children of our times he said And that is why you make criticisms of the church often blunt criticisms You must continue to tell us everything honestly he added But you must also listen to our criticisms
NO HAZARDS FOUND IN 2 CONTRACEPTIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/16/garden/no-hazards-found-in-2-contraceptives.html,MORE than 3500 physicians who specialize in womens health were told yesterday that two popular forms of birth control  spermicides and birth control pills containing progesterone  do not cause birth defects or spontaneous abortion The conclusions were based on findings in 20 studies conducted since 1972 according to a spokesman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Addressing the annual convention of the organization at the Convention Center in Washington yesterday Dr Joe Leigh Simpson professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago said that women who use spermicides and birth control pills after they become pregnant but before they realize it do not increase the chances that their children will be born with defective hearts or limbs or other chromosomal abnormalities Spermicides which are available in a variety of gels creams and foams and are used in conjunction with other forms of birth control or by themselves have become a cause of public concern his year In January a Federal judge in Georgia awarded 51 million to a woman who testified that she was using a contraceptive gel manufactured by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation when she became pregnant She contended that the gel caused the baby she bore three years ago to be missing one arm and several fingers Ortho said the case would be appealed Dr James L Mills senior investigator in epidemiology for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development presented a report at the convention showing that exposure to spermicides around the time of conception does not cause congenital malformation low birth weight or spontaneous abortion He said that research among 34660 pregnant women at the KaiserPermanente Medical Group of Northern California from 1974 to 1977 showed that the malformation rate in their babies was no greater for spermicide users than for users of other birth control methods While no one would recommend that a woman continue to use spermicides after conception such accidental exposure does not seem to be harmful or cause defects Dr Mills said Suspicions that spermicides might be linked to miscarriage malformations low birth weight Downs syndrome and a preponderance of female births began arising in the early 1980s with the publication of studies in several medical journals In December 1983 a committee of the Food and Drug Administration conducted a threeday hearing and concluded that the information presented was insufficient to warrant a special warning on vaginal contraceptive product labeling regarding the risk of fetal anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities with spermicide use during pregnancy Other studies have been released since then and the prevailing opinion appears to be that they are safe As Dr Carol M Proudfit senior scientist division of drugs and technology of the American Medical Association said in a telephone interview There is no question that babies have been born to mothers using spermicides and there is no question that some have had abnormalities but there is no proof of cause by spermicides No real syndrome has been identified The same condition has not shown up time and time again  rather there have been a variety of conditions said to be connected to spermicides If there is a teratogenic effect  one that causes a malformation of the fetus  it has not been proven in any way Dr Proudfit said Still some authorities harbor reservations None of the research scientists whose work has suggested an association between spermicides and birth defects would discuss their investigations or conclusions In one of the most frequently cited papers in which spermicides were linked in 1981 to four types of birth defects Dr Hershel Jick director of the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Progam wrote Despite the association found the current study leaves a number of important questions unanswered and the results should be considered tentative until confirmed by other data Concern about progesterone in birth control pills began in the 1960s when some thought that it might adversely affect the development of fetal organs early in pregnancy There was concern too  among physicians who had prescribed artificial progesterone to prevent miscarriage among women who had a history of spontaneous abortion  about the possible link between contraceptives and birth defects In the 1970s Dr Simpson said at the convention about 50 studies were done in the US Canada and England to explore this hypothesis and what they all showed was that the birth defects among women who had been exposed to progesterone were no higher than those in the unexposed group

Topics;   All in the Family Speaking of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/17/opinion/topics-all-in-the-family-speaking-of-abortion.html,Every year more than a million American women choose to end their pregnancies and do so safely and lawfully Countless others made the choice years ago before abortion was legal and many of them have terrible stories to tell They remember the desperate search for an abortionist and the frantic hope that he or she would have medical training They remember fear  of hemorrhage infection even death Americans who want to outlaw abortion again dont worry much about the feelings of such women The focus of the prolife lobby is the fetus not the person who refuses to incubate one against her will The entire question ought to be a private matter yet this month many women at the urging of the National Abortion Rights Action League are writing letters about it  to tell the White House and the nation why women should remain free to make their own decisions about their own bodies I am elderly one such letter to President Reagan reads and this letter is to enlighten you about what women have suffered in their long battle for reproductive freedom Speakouts during which women will talk about why they chose abortion and the terror and danger some of them faced are being held in 30 states One woman from each state will go to Washington next week to stage a vigil and deliver the letters Some will be breaking a long surely painful silence All who had abortions will be surrendering their privacy Their willingness to do so is commendable The need for it created by growing agitation harassment even violence against family planning clinics is deplorable
The 'Battle of the Last Colony',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/18/us/the-battle-of-the-last-colony.html,The 638000 residents of the District of Columbia have finally lost a sevenyear struggle for ratification of a Constitutional amendment that would have given the district full voting representation in Congress two United States Senators and a single Representative in the House But that does not mean that the battle of the last colony is over Now comes the next push a drive for admission of the 69squaremile district to the Union as the 51st state to be called New Columbia Like Puerto Rico and Guam Washington currently has a single nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives with Congress retaining veto power over local legislation The constitutional amendment had it been ratified by the required 38 states would have altered that and had the capital treated as though it were a state But in the seven years allowed by Congress for approval of the amendment the legislatures of only 16 states thought such a change acceptable So now because of the 1985 adjournment of a number of legislatures without action ratification by the Aug 22 deadline is a mathematical impossibility Strong Feelings of Politicians The constitutional status of the district stirs strong feelings among politicians particularly Republican politicians who know that any Senate and House members from the predominantly black predominantly Democratic district would probably not be Republicans Thus no Republican state legislature has ever voted to ratify the amendment Statehood is an endrun strategy around the ratification roadblock Admission to the Union as granted to 37 of the former American territories that became states requires only a simple majority vote by Congress not complicated approval by the legislatures of 38 states Still statehood is not likely to come easily for the district if at all For one thing the admission legislation is subject to a Presidential veto and President Reagan has said he is not for it Never sure that the failed constitutional amendment strategy was the way to go the districts Congressional delegate Walter E Fauntroy has bided his time in pressing the theoretically quicker and simpler statehood drive But now he is ready to move and the House Committee on the District of Columbia of which Mr Fauntroy is a senior member will hold a public hearing on the matter Tuesday The aim is to work up a proposal to put before Congress that will be as noncontroversial as possible A proposal already before the committee drafted in 1982 by a rank and file citizens convention calls for a New Columbia with a number of constitutional guarantees enforceable by citizen lawsuits Among them are the right to a job and the right of public employees including fire and police officers and prison guards to strike To some these provisions seem politically unrealistic For example Clint C Hockenberry a lawyer who has studied the proposal at length sees it as a manifesto for a progressive social experiment A study group assembled by Mr Fauntroy and representing diverse views has spent a year preparing recommended changes in the proposal The right to a job would be stricken and only nonessential public employees would have the right to strike subject to abridgement for a compelling government interest Not an Easy Alternative Although the nowdead constitutional amendment had strong bipartisan and even conservative backing when Congress voted in 1978 to send it to the states  Senators Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Barry Goldwater of Arizona both Republicans supported it  the statehood struggle is not expected to be an easy alternative on Capitol Hill Why The district has a liberal abortion law and a strict gun control law policies that its representatives in Congress would be expected to support Both issues are among the most disputed on Capitol Hill In fact Johnny Barnes a former Georgetown University law professor who is Mr Fauntroys top staff aide on the statehood issue said the reason that most states had not acted on ratification of the proposed constitutional amendment could often be traced to lobbying by groups that oppose abortion or gun control If the statehood backers can get a large majority in a House vote this year or next the strategy would be to move on to the Republicancontrolled Senate There the leadership role on statehood belongs to Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts Not insignificantly supporters of the constitutional amendment proposal seven years ago included Senator Bob Dole of Kansas now the majority leader The statehood backers also have in mind using the bicentennial celebration of the United States Constitution in 1987 to help publicize nationally what they call the districts taxation without representation

CONSERVATISM FINDS ITS TV VOICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/arts/conservatism-finds-its-tv-voice.html,The United States Government should overthrow the government in Nicaragua and we should try to do it openly The Reagan Administration should tell all the Americans to get out of Libya and then specifically get the American oil companies out The shooting of U S Army Major Arthur Nicholson by Soviet troops in East Berlin was murder that should prompt the Administration to demand some satisfaction or some penalty Such vivid viewpoints are not what the millions of viewers of evening newscasts have been accustomed to hearing from network commentators But that is the sort of opinion that viewers of ABCs World News Tonight have been listening to twice a week for the past eight months since the network appointed the conservative newspaper and magazine columnist George Will as commentator for the newscast Mr Wills arrival has been hailed by conservatives as the first opportunity for a bona fide thinker from among their ranks to have what William F Buckley calls a presence in the room after years of dominance by what they regard as liberal opinion But conservative viewpoints have been heard on ABC before Howard K Smith for eight years a commentator on that network was hawkish on matters of war and peace although liberal on some social issues Yet more than the cast of Mr Wills ideology it is the pungency of his views that appears to distinguish him from other practitioners of news analysis on the evening news John Chancellor for three years NBCs analyst seen at least twice a week and Bill Moyers CBSs designated  but lately infrequent  commentator since 1982 Mr Will appears twice weekly in The Washington Post and 449 other newspapers reaching a total circulation of 30 million His fortnightly column in Newsweek magazine is read by 20 million His weekly appearance as a panelist on ABCs Sundaymorning program This Week With David Brinkley reaches 46 million viewers All of this combined with his eveningnews appearances seen by 155 million viewers daily  make him the most widely read and heard commentator in America At the other networks Mr Chancellor is generally regarded as a centrist and Mr Moyers who served as press secretary to President Lyndon B Johnson is viewed as a liberal But Mr Moyers objects to that label The right wing would like to freeze me back in that time but they cant he says I dont consider myself an ideological anything Some of the letters to me say I am too liberal and others say I am too conservative At least one study indicates that network commentary overall has been more neutral than many people realize Michael J Robinson director of the Media Analysis Project at George Washington University surveyed network commentary during the first three months of 1983  before Mr Wills arrival and discovered that Mr Chancellors commentaries were overwhelmingly evenhanded and tended to be ambiguous politically rather than conservative or liberal Mr Moyers offered only two commentaries during the period one of which was decidedly liberal the other ambiguous Commentaries by David Brinkley on his Sundaymorning program were also largely ambiguous rather than conservative or liberal George enrages me but I will take him over most says Hodding Carter 3d a former State Department spokesman and frequent television adversary of Mr Will I can hear the sound of strongly felt ideas being ground on my sensibilities At the network level most commentary is mush says Mr Robinson George Will is a breakthrough in terms of the coloration he brings While managing to break the bland barrier in network news commentary the strength of Mr Wills unabashedly conservative opinions has prompted some calls for ABC to provide countervailing views With just one commentator its like an oped page with only one op says Stephen Hess a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution That is bound to cause problems no matter how good that one person is Sam Donaldson ABCs White House correspondent says Lets face it  George is becoming known as ABCs sole commentator and World News Tonight is being known as the one in which the commentator is taking a conservative proAdministration point of view Mr Will objects to the notion of his being paired with an opposing viewpoint  an idea he points out that was never raised in regard to Mr Moyers It is a primitive sense of fairness says Mr Will It is cosmetic fairness that tends to drive each side to positions more extreme than they feel The form drives the substance Others have suggested that the networks rotate commentary among several voices But ABC tried that approach in the 1960s and discontinued it because no one appeared often enough to be recognizable The networks believe that people will be doubly confused if they dont have the same face sitting in the chair all the time says Mr Robinson His commentary Mr Will insists covers a multitude of sins and mostly serves to explain rather than advocate My views are more mixed and moderate than people think he says Mr Will has often articulated his political philosophy in print both in his columns and in a book published in 1983 called Statecraft as Soulcraft He calls himself a Tory conservative to be distinguished from conservatives who advocate free markets and minimal governmental intervention His primary aim he says is to preserve the values and institutions of our society Sounding in some respects like an inheritor of Great Society liberalism he also advocates a strong government to ensure equal justice and equal opportunity Mr Will has been especially forceful on Federal aid to the handicapped a position based in part on his being the father of a mentally retarded 13yearold boy with Downs syndrome However his views on a number of issues  for a strong defense against abortion and affirmative action  put him squarely in the conservative column In 1980 Mr Will backed the candidacy of Ronald Reagan for President He also became an informal adviser to Mr Reagan and ran into charges of conflict of interest as a result After helping Mr Reagan prepare for a televised debate with Jimmy Carter Mr Will appeared on ABC and praised Mr Reagans performance I am a reformed sinner says Mr Will today At age 44 Mr Will makes an estimated 500000 a year from his writing television appearances and speeches Educated at Trinity College Oxford University and Princeton University where he received a PhD in political science he taught political science at Michigan State University and the University of Toronto before he joined the staff of Senator Gordon Allott Republican of Colorado in 1970 He moved from speechwriting to journalism when he began contributing to National Review and The Washington Post In 1974 he branched out into television as a panelist on the publictelevision discussion program Agronsky and Company and ABC hired him in 1980 to provide commentary during the Democratic and Republican conventions After several years on Mr Brinkleys show Mr Will was hired as eveningnews commentator says Roone Arledge president of ABC News because I like to watch his mind work Mr Will prepares his commentaries in a woodpaneled booklined office in a corner of his home in suburban Washington D C Among the memorabilia on the walls  framed book jackets childrens drawings are photos of two of his heroes Winston Churchill and Henry Scoop Jackson the late Senator from Washington His columns and televised comments are often sprinkled with quotations from statesmen and philosophers partly the result of his consuming more than 100 books a year half of them by listening to cassettes while he is jogging or driving his car after 500 miles of jogging he has heard Churchills memoirs through World War II While Mr Will spends an entire day writing one of his columns preparing for the evening news usually takes about an hour He is told by William Lord executive producer of the newscast which of the days news topics he should comment on and he generally delivers his commentaries live in response to a question from Peter Jennings the anchorman On one recent Friday the topic was the furor over President Reagans planned visit to Bitburg the West German cemetery where Waffen SS soldiers are buried Sitting behind a large Victorian oak desk Mr Will spent about a halfhour thinking through the commentary jotting on a lined yellow pad words gate and sentence fragments immovable object irresistible force to illustrate his thoughts He carried the pad to the ABC News headquarters in downtown Washington consulted with Mr Lord and from the anchor desk in the newsroom began an entreaty to Mr Reagan Dont go in the gate at Bitburg Without benefit of a Teleprompter Mr Will referred only briefly to his scribbles and delivered a seamless 80 seconds of opinion Mr Will prefers to speak as close to extemporaneously as he can I am a writer who does television he says If I wrote out a commentary I would do something intended for the eye and shove it in the ear Nor does he practice his commentaries aloud before he appears on camera I say it in my mind I can hear the phrases he explains Mr Will is generally credited with exerting influence among policymakers in Washington Although he says he hasnt spoken with Mr Reagan for nearly a year Mr Will is friendly with a number of Reagan Administration officials including Richard N Perle Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy and David A Stockman President Reagans Budget Director He raises the level of discussion and debate says Stephen Hess at the Brookings Institution The Administration says Hugh Sidey the Washington columnist for Time magazine in subtle but perceptible ways takes more heart when George advocates something or maybe gives pause when he doesnt But how much television is a part of that influence on policymakers is questionable mainly because television commentaries go by too quickly to change anyones views There is enough time to make a point but not to build a case I dont believe that commentators have any impact other than to reinforce the committed and infuriate the opposed says Michael Robinson of George Washington University Mr Will himself doubts he changes much opinion I am there to help people think about the news he says The idea that multitudes will be driven to their knees by the force of my words is silly Despite the questions about its form and its influence practioners of eveningnews commentary contend that it has a place NBC doesnt put me on because of my opinions but because I add a dimension that cant be done in news reporting says Mr Chancellor Mr Moyers contends that commentary should not be the final word It is not an exclamation point to a debate It is just a lifting of the curtain to see a little further into something than might have been seen without it The problem of balance in the view of Mr Chancellor is best addressed within the commentaries themselves When you are the only commentator you have an obligation to try and include different points of view he says And both Mr Chancellor and Mr Moyers believe that given the limitations of their form they cannot be too ideological There is a dancing line between opinion and analysis Mr Moyers says Sometimes you inadvertently cross over it but the next time you step back Mr Will however believes that sharp opinions have their place on television and that his sharp opinions are not going to harm anyone I am a moderate temperate person

new novel are the rules that are posted by the light switch in the cider house of Ocean View apple orchard on the coast of Maine where about half the action of Mr Irvings story is set Please dont operate the grinder or the press if youve been drinking one of them typically reads But these rules are more or less ignored An altogether different set is followed by the migrant workers who stay in the cider house A typical one holds that if you get in a knife fight you cut your opponent just enough to end the fight not enough to hospitalize him and attract the authorities Naturally there is a good deal of cutting in The Cider House Rules Similarly two sets of rules vie with one another at the locale where the rest of Mr Irvings novel is set The law of early 20thcentury America says that doctors mustnt commit abortions But at St Clouds orphanage which is inland from Ocean View and is a different sort of orchard Dr Wilbur Larch follows his own rules No one he believes should ever make a woman have a baby she didnt want to have Therefore he was an obstetrician but when he was asked  and when it was safe  he was an abortionist too The point  which is driven home with the sledgehammer effect that John Irving usually uses  is that there are always multiple sets of rules for a given society Heroism lies in discovering the right ones whether they are posted on the wall or carved with scalpels and committing yourself to follow them no matter what As Dr Larch writes to Homer Wells his surrogate son and unwilling heir apparent  How can you allow yourself a choice in the matter when there are so many women who havent the freedom to make the choice themselves And How can you feel free to choose not to help people who are not free to get other help Actually this is a sharper point than Mr Irving has made in any of his previous five novels the most recent and famous of which have been The World According to Garp 1978 and The Hotel New Hampshire 1981 His novels have tended to sprawl both in tone and focus but in The Cider House Rules he has positively streamlined his form There are other refinements as well There are no bears no bodybuilding obsessions no visits to Vienna and not a single successful rape at least not of any immediate member of the cast of characters Obviously some of the women who stream endlessly into St Clouds for abortions or deliveries must surely have been rape victims Even Mr Irvings excesses seem a little less excessive Its true that the novel is full of the mixture of comedy and violence that by now has become almost the authors trademark An excessively outdoorsy couple goes swimming in some rapids and gets swept away and killed by a log drive A lobsterman who loves to tinker blows himself and his lobster pound to pieces while building a homemade torpedo Parts of the lobsters land near an icecream stand hundreds of yards away prompting one wise guy to ask if the proprietor is working on a new flavor A large and angry woman named Melony goes around wrecking buildings and beating up any men who try to molest her The novel is also full of Mr Irvings special brand of cuteness The family of a man dying of Alzheimers Disease theyve always thought him a drunk cant remember the word Alzheimers and so refers to it as Als Hammer disease An interfering trustee of the St Clouds orphanage wants to accuse Dr Larch of being a nonpracticing homosexual All the years in the book are referred to with a dash replacing their final digit 190 192 195 and so forth even when they are invoked to date the bombing of Pearl Harbor or the year of the ArmyMcCarthy hearings And yet the familiar elements of the macabre the violent and the cute all seem more controlled and pointed more dedicated to the end of advancing Mr Irvings story toward a definite and coherent resolution The same can be said of the authors penchant for sentimentality for aphoristic statements and for lockerroom humor It is as if he had made up his mind to stop pretending to be anything but a realist writing a morality tale and to devote all his strengths and weaknesses to that particular end Oddly he seems troubled by this in a press release accompanying the novel Mr Irving states somewhat gratuitously I believe in characterization I believe in linear narrative I am not an experimental writer I am a writer who tells stories about victims Yet its to everyones advantage that Mr Irvings is accepting himself as a conventional realist For The Cider House Rules has greater force and integrity than either of its two immediate predecessors Its funny and absorbing and it makes clever use of the plots seeming predictability There are also a couple of small effects that seem to have Mr Irvings personal touch One thinks for a small but telling example of the empty rubber float that the victim of Alzheimers Disease used to loaf on before he died John Cheever  with whom Mr Irving shares an obsession with the owning classes their guilts and their possessions  would have had his narrator sense the sadness of the abandoned raft being blown about the swimming pool as winter comes on In the world of significant objects that The Cider House Rules creates this sadness of neglected things occasionally speaks to us directly

SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP;   JUSTICES WIDEN REVIEW OF STATE ABORTION CURBS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/21/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-widen-review-of-state-abortion-curbs.html,The Supreme Court today expanded its continuing review of state efforts to restrict access to legal abortions The Court announced it would hear a joint appeal by the state of Illinois and an antiabortion group Americans United for Life of a ruling that key elements of the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975 were unconstitutional Last month the Court agreed to review a Federal court ruling that Pennsylvanias Abortion Control Act was unconstitutional The two cases will be argued together next fall insuring that the abortion issue will be a highly visible part of the Courts next term The Courts decision to hear the Illinois case was surprising on two counts The first is that the state Legislature has already amended the law to modify portions that the Federal District Court in Chicago found most objectionable The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Courts decision that the prior law was unconstitutional but did not comment on the amended version The Supreme Court ordinarily refuses to rule on laws that are no longer on the books The other reason for surprise is that in striking down the statute the lower courts did not make new law but applied the Supreme Courts own precedents Two years ago in a 6to3 vote the Court strongly reaffirmed its 1973 decision in Roe v Wade that made abortion a constitutionally protected right Other recent decisions have emphasized that the state cannot interfere with the medical judgments of individual doctors on how best to treat their patients Unless the Court wants to reexamine these decisions there would be little reason to take the case How Illinois Law Worked The Illinois law made it a crime for a doctor to cause the death of a viable fetus by performing an abortion Another section made it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion when viability is a possibility The lower courts struck down both these sections on the grounds that they were too vague that they interfered with a doctors medical judgment and that in the case of the second section the state lacks a compelling interest in the welfare of a fetus that is not yet viable The state Legislature amended these sections to provide that the question of viability was a judgment for the doctor to make The law also requires doctors to inform patients that certain types of birth control are abortifacients  that they permit conception but prevent the fertilized egg from developing The statute did not specify these methods but the most common one is the intrauterine device The Court of Appeals declared this section unconstitutional because it incorporated the view that life begins at conception and forces the physician to act as the mouthpiece for the states theory of life In the appeal Diamond v Charles No 841379 the state says the law prevents not abortion but only hostile activity directed toward the fetus There were also these other developments today Honduran Land Suit Without a formal opinion the Court overturned a ruling by the Federal appeals court here that permitted the owner of a ranch in Honduras to sue the Pentagon for what he argued was the illegal appropriation of his land The suit had not gone to trial The land has been used under Defense Department auspices as a training camp for Salvadoran troops The owner Temistocles Ramirez de Arellano is an American citizen argued that he has never received the compensation to which the Constitution entitles him for the destruction of his property and business In a unanimous order the Court today sent the case back to the appeals court for further consideration in light of a law passed by Congress last October That law provides for a cutoff of further operations on the property unless the Honduran Government was willing to resolve the claim The Justice Department advised the Court last month that the case was now the subject of sensitive diplomatic discussions between the United States and Honduras and that further litigation could adversely affect the interests of the United States in this critical area of the world Weinberger v Ramirez No 841398 Labor Violations The Court agreed to rule on the constitutionality of a Wisconsin law barring repeated violators of Federal labor laws from doing business with the state A Federal appeals court ruled that the state had no power to act in this area which it said was comprehensively regulated by the Federal Government under the National Labor Relations Act Under the Wisconsin law a company found by a Federal court to have committed three labor law violations within the last five years may not do business with the state for three years Wisconsin v Gould No 841484 Desegregation Funds The Court refused to hear an appeal by the Chicago Board of Education from a ruling that the Federal Government was not obliged to provide extra funds to help Chicago carry out a desegregation plan for its public schools The desegregation plan is part of a consent decree worked out in 1980 between the city and the Federal Government that involves upgrading a number of schools The decree required the Government to make every good faith effort to provide money for implementation and the Government sent Chicago a onetime payment of 20 million A Federal District Court ruled last year that this was inadequate and that more than 100 million a year would be required but the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit overturned that ruling as a abuse of discretion Bd of Education v US No 841366

PANEL WOULD EASE RULES ON COLLEGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/22/us/panel-would-ease-rules-on-colleges.html,The House Education and Labor Committee voted today for legislation that would overturn rules prohibiting federally assisted colleges and universities from taking any punitive steps against employees or students who have had abortions After heavy lobbying by Roman Catholic groups the committee voted 18 to 14 for an amendment that opponents said would allow colleges and univesities to discriminate against students and employees who have had abortions The opponents said the rules now protect against dismissal of these employees and removing the students from honor societies college jobs or other school organizations The rules also bar institutions with health plans from denying insurance coverage for abortions James M Jeffords of Vermont the committees ranking Republican said the amendment would remove protections now contained in the regulations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 a Federal law that bars sex discrimination in any education program or activity that receives Federal aid Bill Aimed at Court Ruling The vote was on an amendment offered by Representative Tom Tauke Republican of Iowa to a bill that would overturn the Supreme Court interpretation of Title IX in its 1984 decision on Grove City College in Pennsylvania In that case the High Court narrowed the application of Title IX so that it covered only the departments of a college or university directly receiving Federal funds By 29 to 2 the committee voted to approve the bill which would apply Federal laws barring discrimination on age race sex and the handicapped to colleges state governments or companies that receive Federal aid Civil rights groups which have pushed for legislation to reverse the Grove City decision praised the bill but criticized the antiabortion amendment as well as a second approved by the committee The second would exempt from Title IX the activities at colleges and universities that result from religious beliefs Supporters of Mr Taukes amendment said it was needed to blunt even stronger attacks on the floor by antiabortion interests The vote on the amendment presented a tough decision for Mario Biaggi Democrat of the Bronx Mr Biaggi has supported the efforts to overturn the Grove City decision but he has also sided in the past with antiabortion forces in the House He was told by Augustus F Hawkins of California the committees chairman that addition of an abortion amendment could mean defeat of the civil rights package In a speech moments before the vote Mr Biaggi said he would vote for Mr Taukes amendment on the floor but would vote present in committee I think its important that we have a civil rights bill he said
ABORTION CHOICE DEFENDED IN CAPITAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/22/us/abortion-choice-defended-in-capital.html,A little more than a year ago Rabbi Shira Stern lay on a New York hospital bed waiting miserably for the beginning of the induced contractions that would abort her defective fivemonthold fetus Her husband turned on the television set for distraction and there was President Reagan addressing a convention of religious broadcasters attacking abortion and lamenting the 15 million children who will never laugh never sing never know the joy of human love Even in the pain we felt we were tremendously angry Rabbi Stern said So today she and her husband part of a force of women and men drawn from every state in the Union stood in a downtown plaza near the Capitol Under a banner that read We Are Your Mothers Your Daughters Your Sisters Your Friends they told of the rape the poverty the youth the inadequacy or the biological defect that had led them to choose abortion They were taking part in a new drive mounted by the National Abortion Rights Action League to defend the legal practice of abortion against its attackers and to show that as Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the league said People who have abortions in this country are not selfish irresponsible people who dont care about family 35000 Personal Testimonials From 7 oclock this morning on into the night single women divorced women married women mothers and grandmothers told of abortions and read letters from the flood of 35000 to 40000 personal testimonials the league says have poured in in the last two months At a hotel conference room across the street the National Right to Life organization began its own counterattack on this new offensive The founder of the group Women Exploited by Abortion characterized women who believe they made the right decision in having an abortion as emotionally ill And a Senate subcommittee heard medical experts testify on the subject of fetal pain in the aborton process In each case the events were recorded by cameras and reporters as part of an increasingly emotional battle for public support in the debate about abortion which was legalized by the Supreme Court 12 years ago To a large extent like so many political conflicts now the fight over abortion is one of focus and image I wanted to find a way to treat the issue so that when people think of abortion what they see in their mind is not a fetal picture but the face of someone they know someone who is not a murderer Miss Falkenberg said Veracity of Tape Is Debated The league decided on the strategy of asking women who had had abortions to come forward and tell their stories earlier this year after the Presidents speech about fetal pain and the release of a video track The Silent Scream began stirring strong emotions The tape purports to show a 12week fetus recoiling in openmouthed pain as an abortion begins Dr Bernard Nathanson the New York physician and former abortion practitioner who narrates the video track testified at the subcommittee hearing this morning Various prominent physicians have said that the tape is deceptive because the nervous system of a 12week fetus is insufficiently developed to allow it to feel pain At the subcommittee hearing some of the medical experts testifying agreed with Dr Nathanson and some did not At the National Right to Life conference afterward Dr Nathanson spoke about the videotapess propaganda value It was televised footage of the victims of the Vietnam War that turned the public against that war he said and now we have a videotape that shows abortion from the victims point of view As the former director of the largest abortion clinic in the Western Hemisphere Dr Nathanson said he supervised 75000 abortions before deciding that the practice was wrong He insisted that there is a reasonable probability that the child even at 12 weeks is experiencing a primitive pain Our Name Is Legion At the speakout across the street Ann Taylor Allen one of the women who had an abortion at Dr Nathansons New York clinic and an associate history professor at the University of Louisville read the letter she had written to Mr Reagan explaining why she and thousands of other women are now choosing to make the case for abortion We are nameless but our name is legion she read We are the millions of women who every year in every town state and nation seek abortion In 1970 as a married graduate student and mother of a sevenmonthold baby she found herself pregnant again despite having been fitted by the clinic with an intrauterine device Why may Bernard Nathanson speak freely and publicly about his experience of abortion while I his expatient am ashamed embarrased and afraid to speak she continued Why should a 12week fetus be given a voice even a scream while the woman in whose body it resides has no voice at all I am writing in order to give th at woman a voice and a name  my voice my name If women who support reproductive choice do not tell their stories she wrote the President then the debate will be dominated by those who in the name of political religious or moral principle ignore us and our needs and sometimes view us simply as containers for the next generation Letter Speaks of Anguish Rabbi Stern and her husband Rabbi Donald A Weber who are now expecing a child in August took turns reading their letter to Mr Reagan a letter that spoke of the anguish they felt over the abortion of a child they said they had dearly wanted but who would have died at birth if carried to term When they left the platform they held each other for long moments You dont have to show us pictures of fetuses in jars  we held our own shortly after the abortion the letter said If you do not approve we do not ask that you follow in our footsteps But dont tell us that we do not understand the issue or the tragedy We pray that no one in your family will ever need to understand as fully and personally as we do now The women will take their letters to lobby members of Congress on Wednesday At some point said Marcia Niemann the leagues project director copies of all of the letters will be sent to the White House
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/23/books/books-of-the-times-258905.html,IN THE NAME OF EUGENICS Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity By Daniel J Kevles 426 pages Knopf 2295 AT a superficial glance one might judge the subject of eugenics to be a dead one After all  as Daniel J Kevles points out in the preface to In the Name of Eugenics  though the word was coined in 1883 from the Greek root meaning good in birth or noble in heredity it came in time to have extremely ugly connotations Indeed the practice of eugenics would seem to have been discredited once and for all by the uses to which it was put in Nazi Germany which as Professor Kevless history reminds us were not just isolated aberrations but the culmination of elitist racist tendencies at work from the late 19th century onward Who in these enlightened times would want to reinvoke a theory of racial stereotypes or return to the practice of sterilizing people judged from a narrowly elitist point of view to be defective by virtue of their genetic endowment And yet as Professor Kevless seamless narrative proceeds to show we may now be back at the point where we started except that our language is a good deal fancier  instead of eugenics we have genetic engineering  and our methods are vastly more sophisticated  from simple sterilization we have come to amniocentesis and abortion with recombinant DNA techniques not too far down the road And if any readers think that the issues are clearer now let them argue with the French geneticist Jerome Lejeune who deplores the practice of aborting victims of Downs syndrome and says that he looks forward to the day when a Mongolian idiot treated biochemically becomes a successful geneticist How we got from there to here is a river of historical narrative that flows straight and smooth in Professor Kevless study of the past 100 years or so and is given particular continuity by his use of the past tense even when he is writing about events that seemed to have happened only yesterday Yet the landscape through which he takes us achieves extraordinary variety There are the many striking personalities who have been attracted to the study of heredity during its controversial development  people like Francis Galton the Victorian scientist who coined the word eugenics and founded the faith in its promise for the perfection of mankind or JBS Haldane the inexhaustible English polymath who led the reaction against the excesses of eugenics or Karl Pearson the Fabian biometrician raised by a Quaker father so pleasuredenying that on vacations he would force his son to follow along on flyfishing tramps but instruct him not to cast if fish were about Professor Kevles writes with gusto about these people particularly about their backgrounds It is almost as if he wanted to belie the notion that humans can be reduced to their biochemistry There are scientific concepts to be absorbed  Gregor Mendels law of segregation and independent assortment the statistics of biometry the process by which it was finally discovered that humans possess 46 not 48 chromosomes Professor Kevles draws them into the scenery as if they were nothing more complicated than rocks and meadows There are two banks to his river one English the other American Professor Kevles writes about them both because as he accurately sums it up the comparative approach has helped to explain certain important features of this history  for example why a eugenic legislative program succeeded at least partially in the United States but not at all in Britain  that would otherwise have remained puzzling He adds I have also attempted a critical assessment of AngloAmerican eugenicists as they diversely recognized themselves before the Nazis came to power and the assessment has led me to depart from prevailing interpretations to advance the view instead that eugenics involved not only scientific rationalizations of class and race prejudice but a good deal more including disputes over how men and especially women of the modern era were to accommodate to changing standards of sexual and reproductive behavior Professor Kevles who teaches history at the California Institute of Technology was led to write In the Name of Eugenics in part by what he learned from the subject of his previous book The Physicists The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America which won the National Historical Society Prize in 1979 Physicists were not prepared to face the issues of nuclear energy that suddenly confronted them in 1945 and geneticists are no better prepared for the coming revolution in their field even though it may be comparable in magnitude and more imminent than they now have reason to expect This assessment effectively dampens any sense of wonder we might feel at the prospects for the future outlined in this history The genetic design of a human perhaps within a hundred years Gene therapy for people by the end of the century The right to abort a victim of TaySachs disease tomorrow After reading In the Name of Eugenics we dont know whether to gasp in awe or gulp in terror Contrary to Francis Galtons grand visions of progress we end up feeling no better about the future of mankind than did our most optimistic ancestors And if they were to see the results of what they envisioned they would not feel optimistic at

ABORTION LIMITS REJECTED IN BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/23/us/abortion-limits-rejected-in-bill.html,The House Judiciary Committee today rejected efforts to limit abortion rights as part of a bill that supporters said would restore civil rights enforcement powers that the Supreme Court curbed last year The committee voted 21 to 12 for the Civil Rights Restoration Act The House Education and Labor Committee which shares jurisdiction on the issue approved a similar bill including the limit on abortion rights by 29 to 2 on Tuesday Both bills would overturn the Feb 28 1984 Supreme Court decision involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania In a 6to3 ruling the Court said the Education Act Amendments of 1972 banned sex discrimination only in a specific program or activity receiving Federal aid and not in the entire institution The college had challenged reporting requirements The purpose of the committees legislation is to bar all discrimination in schools and other teaching facilities such as hospitals that receive Federal funds Limits on Health Insurance But the Judiciary Committee spent several hours disputing the abortion issue after abortion opponents tried to incorporate an amendment identical with the one approved by the Education Committee Tuesday that would repeal a 1975 law That law requires universities to offer student and employee health insurance that covers abortions as well as childbirth expenses The law also forbids expelling women who have had abortions or excluding them from honorary societies and other activities Because the Education Committee bill contained the abortion amendment the House Rules Committee must decide which measure the House will vote on and whether amendments will be permitted The Rules Committee is not expected to act or several weeks After the Judiciary Committees approval of the overall bill Peter W Rodino Jr Democrat of New Jersey the panels chairman said The Civil Rights Restoration Act will close the loophole opened by the Supreme Court and insure that our civil rights laws are applied broadly It will guarantee that taxpayer dollars are not used in any institution that practices discrimination Proponents of the new bills contend that the court misread Title IX of the education amendments and that Congress always intended an entire educational institution to be covered by civil rights laws if any one of its components received Federal money The Grove City decision has affected the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which covers the handicapped and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975

"FOR ANITA O'DAY, 50 YEARS IN SONG ARE MARKED",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/24/arts/for-anita-o-day-50-years-in-song-are-marked.html,ANITA ODAY who made her reputation as a singer with the big bands of Gene Krupa and Stan Kenton in the 1940s will be back in front of a big band tonight at Carnegie Hall to celebrate her 50th year as a performer Actually it is her 51st year but to call it her 50th is not the usual show business fudging of dates We were going to do it last year which actually was my 50th anniversary Miss ODay explained the other day We  meaning me and John Poole who has been my drummer for 33 years and my manager for most of that time  wanted to have a 50th anniversary celebration at Carnegie Hall but it was already booked for last year This was the earliest date we could get So its still the 50th anniversary concert  just a little late One year more or less makes very little difference to Miss ODay She is 65 years old and if anything she looks and sounds better than she ever has She walks into a restaurant with a lively energetic step breaks into a little dance of greeting and sits down bubbling with enthusiastic conversation She is slim and tan and the only sign of her age is a slight arthritic swelling of her fingers Walkathon Was the Start That she has actually arrived at this age and in this condition is remarkable when one considers what she has done en route Starting at the age of 14 when she entered a walkathon in Chicago  an endurance contest in which she sang in public for the first time her songs were The Lady in Red and I Cant Give You Anything But Love and one of her partners was a youngster who later adopted the name Frankie Laine she managed to become a very individual and popular jazz singer while making almost every wrong move possible in her personal life She put it all in her autobiography High Times Hard Times In it she told how she survived Depressionera walkathons a rape two broken marriages 18 abortions numerous arrests and trials a sixmonth jail term a complete breakdown brought on by the rigors of band touring alcoholism 14 years of heroin addiction and a year of going cold turkey in Hawaii Now she thinks about contemporaries who took better care of themselves but whose talent has withered who have deteriorated physically or who are dead and she wonders how she survived It might be faith in God she suggests or just good genes The fact that Miss ODay sings today much as she sang when she was starting may stem from the fact that she was not able to sing in the same way other singers do When she was 7 a doctor who was removing her tonsils also cut off her uvula a fleshy part of the soft palate As a result she has no vibrato and is unable to hold notes in the way that most singers do They may sing quarter notes that become an extended laaaaa while Miss ODay limited to a stacatto series of lalala developed a singing style based on eighth and sixteenthnotes Add to that a way of phrasing that she picked up from Billie Holiday and a natural huskiness that was taken up by June Christy Chris Connor and others and you have a singing style that despite her followers has been idiomatically Miss ODays for half a century Varied Program Her program tonight will draw on her bigband days and the 40 years since in which she has performed mostly with small groups She plans to spend this afternoon at Carnegie Hall rehearsing with the 16piece band that will accompany her for part of the program because she says I havent done much work with a big band lately The group was put together by the bassist Jay Leonhart and will include the trombonists Urbie Green and Jim Pugh and the saxophonists Jerry Dodgion Frank Wess and Frank Foster There will be no conductor because Miss ODay went into big bands without a conductor When I was with Gene Krupa he was always at the drums she explained There was nobody out front  except me She will do three of the songs from the Krupa days Boogie Blues Opus One and her first big hit Let Me Off Uptown which she sang with Roy Eldridge the bands star trumpet player Mr Eldridge who is 74 years old and has not played trumpet since he suffered a heart attack in 1980 will join her onstage tonight to repeat the vocal duet they created more than 40 years ago She will also be accompanied by a trio  Hank Jones on piano Mr Leonhart on bass and Mr Poole at the drums  who will double as the rhythm section of the big band With them she will offer samples of her postbigband days The sampling will come up to the present to include a treatment of My Funny Valentine in which she will be joined by the altosaxophonist Richie Cole with whom she has been touring in Japan and Hawaii Tickets for Miss ODays concert tonight at 8 at Carnegie Hall are 15 20 and 25 They can be bought at the box office or by calling Carnegie Charge 2477800
SMOKING IS SAID TO IMPAIR FERTILITY IN WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/24/us/smoking-is-said-to-impair-fertility-in-women.html,Women who smoke are less fertile than nonsmokers and it takes them longer to become pregnant when they try to conceive according to a new report A survey of pregnant women found that smokers were 72 percent as fertile as nonsmokers in a typical month In their first month of trying to conceive 38 percent of the nonsmokers became pregnant as against 28 percent of the smokers After six months of trying o conceive the study said 90 percent of the nonsmokers succeeded as opposed to only 76 percent of the smokers It also found that heavy smokers had more difficulty conceiving than did light smokers The study said the smoking habits of the womens husbands had no measurable effect on the fertility of the women Previous Research Cited The study published yesterday in The Journal of the American Medical Association is the first designed specifically to address the relationship between smoking and fertility Previous research has established that smoking by women in pregnancy posed health risks to the fetus raising the chances of spontaneous abortion low birth weight and death soon after birth but has yielded inconsistent data on what effects smoking before conception has on a womans ability to become pregnant Donna Day Baird and Allen J Wilcox of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences a Federal agency based in Chapel Hill NC collected data on smoking history and the time taken to conceive from 678 pregnant women Only women who had planned pregnancy and conceived within two years of the decision to become pregnant were included in the study The women ranged in age from 18 to 38 years and were generally well educated and affluent one in five was a smoker After reviewing the possible sources of bias in their research the authors concluded We are left with a reduced fertility associated with cigarette smoking although the magnitude of the effect may be either smaller or larger than the reduction observed in this study Cause of Impairment Unknown The study said that the mechanism by which smoking impaired a womans reproductive capacity had not been determined but that it could range from a temporary localized disruption of uterine function to mutagenic damage of the egg The authors of the study said their findings should thus be taken as a warning signal of possible longterm damage to fetuses from smoking before conception The authors also said their study together with other laboratory findings provided evidence that cigarette smoking is a reproductive hazard even before women know they are pregnant According to another report in The Journal elderly smokers can improve the blood flow to the brain by abstaining from cigarettes Although the impact tobacco use has on the incidence of strokes is unclear the report said It is becoming more apparent that cigarette smoking does indeed exert adverse effects on the competency of the cerebral circulation When smokers even those who have smoked for decades stop smoking the researchers concluded significant improvement in cerebral circulation occurs within a relatively short period

"For Friedan, a Life on the Run",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/books/for-friedan-a-life-on-the-run.html,BETTY FRIEDAN founder of the modern womens movement said she has tried hard this spring to get some work done on her fourth book which is about aging She has been working on it for five years But there are always distractions she said a trip to Nicaragua where she met with leaders of womens groups a trip to Munich West Germany to protest President Reagans visit to the Bitburg cemetery and a commencement address at the State University of New York at Stony Brook where she received an honorary degree Whenever things get too hectic the 64yearold feminist leader does what she has been doing for the last five years Hotfoot it out to Sag Harbor where she owns a 165yearold white saltbox house on Glover Street That house saves my life she said Buying it was the smartest thing I ever did Miss Friedan who also has an apartment near Lincoln Center in Manhattan usually spends most of the summer at her Sag Harbor house the backyard of which slopes down to a cove She does most of her writing and all of her entertaining there I never have a party anywhere else she said A lot of my friends just happen to be here They include the writers Richard Reeves E L Doctorow David Alpern Carol Kramer Wilfrid Sheed and Miriam Ungerer and the editor Alice Mayhew This year her summer wont be quite as relaxing as she plans to spend a good part of July at the Forum a nongovernmental womens conference to be held in conjunction with a United Nationssponsored womens conference both in Nairobi Kenya The two conferences will mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women Although there have been predictions that the United Nationssponsored conference might deteriorate into a squabble over the Palestinian question as was the case at a similar conference in Copenhagen in 1980 Miss Friedan seems hopeful about the outcome I just think that a lot of women in a lot of countries of this world know its the only chance we have to get together internationally and compare notes she said We all want something to come out of this There is no provision for permanent machinery at the United Nations for monitoring womens progress so weve got to see that something real is accomplished She added that the heads of many delegations at the conference would be strong feminists whereas the delegations at previous such conferences in Mexico City and Copenhagen were often headed by wives of political leaders who were not primarily concerned with womens rights Miss Friedan said that any attempts to disrupt the conference with extraneous political issues would probably come from governments whose real motivation was to keep women in their countries from taking their concrete rights They want to push women back under the veil she said Miss Friedan who plans to head an unofficial delegation from the National Organization for Women said she had asked for a tree with shade for 20 people at the Forum I plan to sit under it every day and talk about the future direction of feminism she said Later in July she may have to face a potentially divisive situation within NOW There have been reports that Eleanor Smeal former president of the group plans to challenge the current president Judy Goldsmith who has served one twoyear term Traditionally the NOW president is allowed to serve two twoyear terms I think its most irresponsible of Ellie to try to get back power in NOW said Miss Friedan who was one of the groups founders There is no real issue  nothing is wrong at all with Judys leadership To me it seems just a case of somebody missing power Asked what she thought were the most important womens issues of the day Miss Friedan mentioned pay equity also known as comparable worth That was a wonderful breakthrough in Los Angeles she said referring to a recently adopted union contract that includes 12 million in raises for pay equity over three years As a result 3900 clerks and librarians most of them women will receive raises to make their salaries equal to comparable jobs held by men  like maintenance workers gardeners and other city employees She warned that women must continue their fight for abortion even though it is legal because of the strong campaign to outlaw it by religious and conservative political groups The real point of the whole terrorism against abortion clinics is to try to push women back down again she asserted The Government should be doing something about the bombing of these clinics The honorary doctorate of humane letters that Miss Friedan received on May 19 from the State University of at Stony Brook was her second honorary degree She also has one from Smith College her alma mater I started out to be an academic she said a wistful smile crossing her face I was going to be a psychologist in research and theory I did a year of graduate work at Berkeley but didnt finish because I thought Im not going to have that kind of intellectual career That was the time of the feminine mystique She said the fact that two of her books The Feminine Mystique and The Second Stage are used as texts at some colleges helped assuage her guilt about her academic incompletion She has also been a visiting professor or fellow at a number of colleges including Yale Harvard Columbia and Temple Universities and Queens College Miss Friedan is currently working on her fourth book The Fountain of Age which she said she hopes will break through the age mystique Everything I learned from the woman thing Im using here and more so she said Its both painful and exhilarating because Im at a new jumpingoff point in my own life Her second book It Changed My Life will be reissued in June by W W Norton with a new introduction Its the new mellower Betty she said with a smile Im at peace with myself in the introduction She has also become more interested in herself as both a woman and a Jew and she is cochairman of the National Commission for Womens Equality of the American Jewish Congress This is relatively new she said My feminism led me to it It started when I was asked to keynote a dialogue in Israel last year called Woman as Jew Jew as Woman  Her recent trip to Munich to protest President Reagans visit to Bitburg was under the auspices of the American Jewish Congress She and others laid a wreath on the graves of Sophie and Hans Scholl leaders of the underground student movement who were executed by the Nazis She also attended a memorial service in Dachau In the same year Hitler took away the very humanity of the Jews she said angrily he also outlawed the feminist movement and took away from women the right to hold political office and professional jobs He reduced them to kinder kirche and kuche Another fairly new role for Miss Friedan is that of grandmother which she calls a very satisfying thing The mother of three grown children she is also the grandmother of Raphael Friedan age 3 who visits her frequently in Sag Harbor Hes such a loving marvelous bundle of life she said Ive got to find him a little tent this weekend He just loves hiding places and I have to go find one
"MORE THAN 'LAW AND ORDER,' 2 CARDINALS SAY",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/world/more-than-law-and-order-2-cardinals-say.html,It was a formidable even intimidating sight Archbishops John J OConnor of New York and Bernard Law of Boston were walking through St Peters Square Friday afternoon on the eve of their elevation as cardinals today Between them was Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger the head of the Vaticans Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Cardinal Ratzinger one of the most powerful men in the Vatican is seen by many inside and outside the Roman Catholic Church as the leading edge of Pope John Paul IIs campaign for orthodoxy in the church New Cardinals OConnor and Law are viewed as carrying that campaign to the United States  to the point where the two have been dubbed Law and Order Oh no I can just see it now said Archbishop OConnor in mock horror as a photographer snapped a picture Friday It will be Law and Order getting their orders from Cardinal Ratzinger A Revealing Comment The comment was revealing about the importance that has been attached to the two American prelates out of the 28 clerics elevated today and why their becoming cardinals is seen by many church followers as a turning point in the history of the Catholic Church in the United States The men are vastly different in background and temperament Cardinal OConnor who spent more than 20 years in the Navy is irrepressible quick with a quip ever ready to make a joke at his own expense Cardinal Law a deepvoiced former Catholic newspaper editor is also ready to talk but is careful with words and more scholarly in style But both are strong partisans of John Pauls efforts to define a clear Roman Catholic identity based on church leaders interpretation of the Scriptures and church tradition Both support the churchs opposition to birth control and the ordination of women  though both also insist that the church favors upgrading the role of women and has not made as strong a case as it could for birth control Divisive Stances Denied Because the Catholic Church in the United States has taken liberal stands on many issues in recent years church officials and activists say both new cardinals represent a new pole of traditionalist influence In separate interviews both men vehemently denied such divisive interpretations Cardinal OConnor in particular has gone out of his way in the last few days to declare that he and Joseph Cardinal Bernardin the Archbishop of Chicago and a leading liberal have no major differences There can be no doubt though that both new Cardinals relish their roles of leaders in a fight to reestablish what they see as traditional religious values in a secular environment Archbishop Law spoke of a practical atheism that affects many who call themselves Christians the passive acceptance without really avowing it of nontheistic values OConnor Sees Opposition Archbishop OConnor argued that much of the questioning of church values began in the 1960s which he said were characterized by a spirit of individualism and opposition to all establishments including the church But both men argued that the Law and Order tag reflected an incomplete understanding of their views and their relations with other American church leaders Its a cheap pun Cardinal Law said though an understandable cheap pun He said he and Archbishop OConnor were cast too much in the light of their strong stands against abortion during the 1984 Presidential campaign Archbishop OConnor agreed I was accused of having a singleissue obsession he said But that was from people who hadnt heard what I said Sunday after Sunday
THE VETERANS OF ABORTION FIGHT BACK BY SPEAKING UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/weekinreview/the-veterans-of-abortion-fight-back-by-speaking-up.html,The bitter debate over abortions seems to have taken another dramatic turn As part of a new campaign undertaken by the National Abortion Rights Action League called Silent No More almost 40000 women have contributed accounts of the circumstances in which they had abortions Many of the statements were read at a daylong rally here early last week Some participants later called on members of Congress to continue their lobbying  as did many of their opponents who are affiliated with the National Right to Life organization Meanwhile two House committees took differing stands on a narrow but perhaps symbolically important part of the controversy The Education and Labor Committee on Tuesday voted to repeal a 1975 law that requires universities to offer student and employee health insurance that covers abortions as well as childbirth expenses The next day the Judiciary Committee refused to approve repeal For 12 years since the United States Supreme Court recognized the right of women to terminate a pregnancy at any time before the fetus is old enough to live by itself outside the womb abortion rights activists have largely confined themselves to defending that right in the courts in Congress and in political races On the popular plane it was the varied but increasingly wellorganized elements of the antiabortion movement who seemed most visible The abortion rights movement found itself in the curious position of being a victor under seige Its problem as Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the action league reflected was how do you bring energy and passion and commitment to defending what is essentially the status quo That seemed to grow more acute in January of 1984 when President Reagan in a muchpublicized address to the National Religious Broadcasters convention helped call attention to a then littlediscussed element in the dispute  how and whether a fetus reacts to an abortion Theres another grim truth we should face up to he said Medical science doctors confirm that when the lives of the unborn are snuffed out they often feel pain pain that is long and agonizing Some physicians immediately disagreed some supported the President In a years time Dr Bernard Nathanson set out to produce a visual demonstration of a fetus reacting to an abortion He had been a founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League and had supervised or performed 75000 abortions by his own count before changing sides High Tech Tactics His product a stunning videotape made by ultrasound imagery seemed to show  plainly if dimly  a 12week fetus recoiling before the advance of a suction tube Dr Nathanson called it The Silent Scream Medical authorities were divided about what the scene proved But in one stroke the antiabortionist strategy had been lifted to the plane of high technology Thats been our strategy for a long long long time said Daniel J Donehey public relations director of National Right to Life Weve had photographs of what abortion does But weve never had moving pictures of what abortion does Moving pictures move more people The Right to Life Committee the nations largest antiabortion group which would permit abortion only to save the mothers life has now distributed 10000 prints of The Silent Scream Mr Donehey estimates that more than one million people have seen all of it and 150 million have seen the portions shown by the television networks on their morning and evening news shows The leaders of the Abortion Rights Action League soon began contemplating a response In February at a conference of abortion rights groups in Washington the league raised the notion of asking women to tell the public about their abortions The National Abortion Federation subsequently used its 285 member clinics doctors and hospitals to solicit personal statements The Planned Parenthood organization opened a national newspaper and magazine advertising campaign keyed to the Leagues Silent No More demonstration in Washington last week Two days of advertisements a full page each day ran in The New York Times The Washington Post The Chicago Tribune The Los Angeles Times and The San Francisco Chronicle at a cost of 250000 Some 80 national and local news organizations reported on the statements of personal history read here early last week One was Sherry Matuliss Thirty years ago when abortions were illegal except when a mothers life was endangered the 54yearold woman from Peoria Ill said she had been beaten raped and left for dead She subsequently learned she was pregnant and because her husband was away knew it was the rapists child In desperation she said she drank volumes of castor oil and high grade alcohol pounded her stomach with a mallet sat in water so hot it scalded her Finally she said she went to a back alley abortionist I resent more than any words can say what I had to enure to terminate an unbearable pregnancy she said But I resent even more the idea that any woman should for any reason ever again be forced to endure the same Nearby a spokesman for a group called Women Exploited by Abortion said that women who did not admit to having regrets about their abortions were emotionally ill

GUILT AND COMPASSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/books/guilt-and-compassion.html,THE CIDER HOUSE RULES By John Irving 560 pp New York William Morrow  Company 1895 BY turns witty tenderhearted fervent and scarifying The Cider House Rules is for me John Irvings first truly valuable book The storytelling is straightforward  not the case with his huge commercial success The World According to Garp 1978 The theme is in firm focus  not the case with The Hotel New Hampshire 1981 The novelists oftendeplored weakness for the cute and trendy although still evident is here less troubling Far more important The Cider House Rules has a public dimension  could indeed play a significantly assuasive role in an American social conflict that is now dangerously exacerbated The book is to be sure a novel the authors sixth not a tract it follows several human lives from youth to maturity gripping our attention as chronicle rather than argument But it is also a book about abortion and the knowledge and sympathy directing Mr Irvings exploration of the issue are exceptional Pertinent history the specifics of surgical procedure the irrecusable sorrow of guilt and humiliation the needs and rights of children  their weight is palpable in these pages Responsive to the ideals and passions that drive both parties  prolife prochoice  the author does not tease himself with delusions that a sunny negotiated accord waits just down the road There is no maddeningly abstract prattle about the possibility of determining scientifically the precise moment at which the fetus becomes human But Mr Irving draws readers close in the space of his imagination to an understanding of essential links commonalities  even unities  between factions now seething with hatred for each other I have to record at the risk of a pompous sound that the novels potential political consequence as an approach to reconciliation based on clarification of shared moral objectives  moved me to gratitude as I read The time frame extends from the first through the sixth decades of the 20th century we stop well short of the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade that legalized abortion There are two heroes the books first half is dominated by Dr Wilbur Larch a celibate physician who directs an orphanage delivers babies and performs abortions illegally when he was asked and when it was safe The second half belongs to the orphaned unadoptable Homer Wells whom Larch loves as a spiritual son and schools informally as a gynecological surgeon The setting is Maine or rather the two Maines dark and light Larchs orphanage St Clouds is located in a dank stripped far northern river town founded as a logging camp and plunged into decline when a paper company moves downstream Wells spends his 20s and 30s on a seaside farm where Atlantic breezes clean the air and apple and lobster harvests alike confirm the rightness of hope W ARS elections public personages obtrude intermittently It is in letters to FDR for instance that Larch presses his full argument for the legalization of abortion Mr Roosevelt  you of all people  you should know that the unborn are not as wretched or as in need of our assistance as the born Please take pity on the born There is wry scrutiny of several cultural innovations relevant to the books subject including drivein theaters There are striking successes in evoking unsentimentally the imaginative lives of the poor Especially admirable is an easygoing description of migrant workers entertaining themselves on the roof of the cider press that gives the book its title observing the magical lights of a distant county fair and explaining their meaning to one another And there are a halfdozen or more love stories The two most affecting portray the unrequited passion of a pugnacious winningly lewd orphan named Melony for Homer Wells and the unrequited but doomed passion  years later  of Homer Wellss son for a black woman sexually abused by her father But the novels core is the developing conflict between Larch and Wells spiritual father and son concerning the unlawful termination of pregnancies Through a series of complicated schemes  Mr Irving the inventive cleverzany wit is in clear sight here Larch not only trains the orphaned lad as surgeon but arranges an alternative identity for him as a licensed physician Pushed further by the need to allay suspicion among the clinicorphanages trustees he fabricates a record of antiabortion statements for the younger man The goal is to insure that after Larch is gone help will still be available to poor women facing unwanted pregnancies But it emerges that the clicheridden prolife statements sardonically fabricated for Wells are not at total variance with his views Repelled by the surgical procedures of abortion persuaded that the fetus has a soul Wells pulls back from the place prepared for him and a contest of wills ensues A key scene dramatizing that contest  Wellss first expression of disapproval Larchs first selfdefense  takes place in Larchs clinic He is performing an abortion with Wells as anesthetist in the next room a nurse checks the contractions of an unwed mother we have just heard outside the voices of orphanage children pleading for a chance to prove their qualities Im the best Im the best  to a couple newly arrived theoretically in search of an adoptable Wells whose attachment to Larch is deep takes a stand says aloud that he wishes to leave the operating room Continuing to scrape with the curette Larch insists Wells must watch must understand the process must learn to perform it Wells protests Larch is obdurate Anguish and suppressed rage intensify and Larch finally cries out Do I interfere    When absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply cant have an abortion that they simply must go on through with having another  and yet another  orphan do I interfere Do I I do not [Larch] said scraping I deliver it    And do you think there are largely happy histories for the babies born here    But do I resist I do not I do not even recommend I give them what they want an orphan or an abortion I am neutral this is the claim I am a teaching professional I serve my patients will Larchs selfjustifications have force and reason but as we listen we understand that the mans whole response to his work is not in his speech And before the story is done we understand that its mission is to show us what is absent by revealing the full moral and psychological reality experienced by an altruist as abortionist What is absent speaking bluntly is suffering and guilt  Larchs suffering and guilt He began his career confidently but soon found himself fighting his abhorrence of his own surgical procedures The words he addresses late in the book to Wells speak to his own history If abortion was legal a woman would have a choice  and so would you You could feel free not to do it because someone else would But the way it is youre trapped Women are trapped Women are victims and so are you How exactly has Larch been victimized During his medical training he saw the fearful selfmutilation practiced by poor pregnant women As orphanage director he observed firsthand the pathos of the lives and longings of children born unwanted and quickly abandoned More than once in his career he dealt with class hypocrisy  the comfortable assumption that for the Truly Nice double standards are invariably appropriate All that would bring a sensitive physician to a guiltlessness while breaking laws against abortion was seemingly part of Larchs experience And yet he cannot feel guiltless cannot endure his work sees himself as trapped here lies his victimization The procedures of dilation and curettage the sight of the products of conception  limbs organs nascent features of expression  are without anodyne as unbearable to him as to Wells The assurance his crustiness projects edges ever toward hysteria he is addicted to ether his altruism has as its reverse side a near incapacity to express feeling for others Implicit in Larchs suffering is I believe Mr Irvings strong simple theme our learned forbearance and cultivated sensitivity lie at the root both of acceptance of abortion and repugnance for it The orphanage at St Clouds was founded long before the creation of aidtodependentchildren programs in a century during which moving crusades were launched to awaken public consciousness obliviousness is cruelty and forbearance creates obligations to the neighbors children not merely to ones own Subtly shrewdly Mr Irving evokes those crusades The bedtime stories Larch reads aloud to the children in their dormitory are drawn from the novelists  Dickens and Charlotte Bronte  who taught their contemporaries to notice the waifs in their midst to hesitate to scorn or cuff or starve or sell them into slavery as child miners or sweeps Considered in this context Larchs kindly orphanage can be understood as a stage in the history of compassion The same is true for the emergence later on of the initially confident altruistabortionist And it is also true for the development of that figure still later into a person conscious of his guilt suffering and victimization What is felt in the grain of The Cider House Rules  in its study of rulegivers and rulebreakers  is that the history of compassion cannot have a stop and must perpetually demand larger generosities than those hitherto conceived By responding to that demand we may tomorrow invent ways to abolish nightmare choices between born and unborn Something akin to this faith seems alive finally in Larchs successor Homer Wells at the close of the novel in the process of deciding that he must perform abortions he reaches a position on the issue more humane than any summoned by standard prolife prochoice campaign cries V IEWED in literary terms The Cider House Rules is hardly without defect Its young hero and several lesser characters lack presence and independent vitality The accounts of diseases treatments and operations are impressively detailed  Mr Irving acknowledges debts to his grandfather an obstetrician and author of technical manuals and to Dr Richard Selzer a surgeon and essayist  but improbabilities abound in the narrative And there are other difficulties none negligible Often the tone wavers the graphic mode gives way to ghoulishness or bawdy And surely no other writer of literary reputation is as absurdly certain as Mr Irving that the repetition of the words tears and kisses unfailingly summons emotion No one aware of the present literary climate however blames failures to sustain poised thematic seriousness solely on individual novelists It is one thing to counsel an author choosing Mr Irvings themes to aim for the nobility solemnity and heartbreakingly perfect restraint of say a masterwork like Rodins Mother With a Dying Child It is another to explain how these qualities are to be achieved in an age ill at ease with the notion that art can have a subject an age halfpersuaded in fact that no subjects exist except language the death of feeling or the artists proud or nervous separation from society For whole chapters at a time The Cider House Rules manages despite the odds to speak as though the tragedy of a country blinding itself to the history of its own moral progress mattered and as though a writers work has to do not with exterminating pity and anger but with animating them At its best this novel is an example now rare of the courage of imaginative ardor COSTLY PLEASURES John Irving did not intend The Cider House Rules to be a polemic he had hoped to write a lustrous 19thcentury novel with the emotional and atmospheric underpinnings of Jane Eyre or David Copperfield I wanted to write an orphan novel he said recently in his Manhattan apartment It was a year before abortion even entered the story But it made perfect sense In the early part of the century what doctor would be most sympathetic to performing abortions but the doctor who delivered unwanted babies then cared for them in an orphanage Long an advocate of freedom of choice Mr Irving said he had no idea when he began that the novel would develop into such an intense argument about abortion and that it would be published at a time so full of tension over the issue A novelist is like a horse with blinders on he said But Id really be wearing a false coat if I pretended that the real reason abortion is such an issue in this novel is that it makes a better story I was quite happy to be able to use it Still he was eager to abide by his original concept of a novel that was Victorian in texture so he carefully structured the medical and farming details On his bookshelf sits Grays Anatomy alongside The Rabbits Anatomy When I did research at the Yale Medical School he said I was told it would be easier to study an animals anatomy before getting into humans Although Mr Irving says the new novel is a departure for him in the way it sets atmosphere and creates a landscape a friend pointed out a thread that connects it to his other books It seems in all my books every act of sexual pleasure is extremely costly It is part of the New England notion that for every pleasure taken you must make amends I certainly dont think I mean that he said sounding almost horrified at the thought Frankly it sounds rather austere to me  Esther B Fein
"FOR FRIEDAN, A LIFE ON THE RUN",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/nyregion/for-friedan-a-life-on-the-run.html,BETTY FRIEDAN founder of the modern womens movement said she has tried hard this spring to get some work done on her fourth book which is about aging She has been working on it for five years But there are always distractions she said a trip to Nicaragua where she met with leaders of womens groups a trip to Munich West Germany to protest President Reagans visit to the Bitburg cemetery and a commencement address at the State University of New York at Stony Brook where she received an honorary degree Whenever things get too hectic the 64yearold feminist leader does what she has been doing for the last five years Hotfoot it out to Sag Harbor where she owns a 165yearold white saltbox house on Glover Street That house saves my life she said Buying it was the smartest thing I ever did Miss Friedan who also has an apartment near Lincoln Center in Manhattan usually spends most of the summer at her Sag Harbor house the backyard of which slopes down to a cove She does most of her writing and all of her entertaining there I never have a party anywhere else she said A lot of my friends just happen to be here They include the writers Richard Reeves E L Doctorow David Alpern Carol Kramer Wilfrid Sheed and Miriam Ungerer and the editor Alice Mayhew This year her summer wont be quite as relaxing as she plans to spend a good part of July at the Forum a nongovernmental womens conference to be held in conjunction with a United Nationssponsored womens conference both in Nairobi Kenya The two conferences will mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women Although there have been predictions that the United Nationssponsored conference might deteriorate into a squabble over the Palestinian question as was the case at a similar conference in Copenhagen in 1980 Miss Friedan seems hopeful about the outcome I just think that a lot of women in a lot of countries of this world know its the only chance we have to get together internationally and compare notes she said We all want something to come out of this There is no provision for permanent machinery at the United Nations for monitoring womens progress so weve got to see that something real is accomplished She added that the heads of many delegations at the conference would be strong feminists whereas the delegations at previous such conferences in Mexico City and Copenhagen were often headed by wives of political leaders who were not primarily concerned with womens rights Miss Friedan said that any attempts to disrupt the conference with extraneous political issues would probably come from governments whose real motivation was to keep women in their countries from taking their concrete rights They want to push women back under the veil she said Miss Friedan who plans to head an unofficial delegation from the National Organization for Women said she had asked for a tree with shade for 20 people at the Forum I plan to sit under it every day and talk about the future direction of feminism she said Later in July she may have to face a potentially divisive situation within NOW There have been reports that Eleanor Smeal former president of the group plans to challenge the current president Judy Goldsmith who has served one twoyear term Traditionally the NOW president is allowed to serve two twoyear terms I think its most irresponsible of Ellie to try to get back power in NOW said Miss Friedan who was one of the groups founders There is no real issue  nothing is wrong at all with Judys leadership To me it seems just a case of somebody missing power Asked what she thought were the most important womens issues of the day Miss Friedan mentioned pay equity also known as comparable worth That was a wonderful breakthrough in Los Angeles she said referring to a recently adopted union contract that includes 12 million in raises for pay equity over three years As a result 3900 clerks and librarians most of them women will receive raises to make their salaries equal to comparable jobs held by men  like maintenance workers gardeners and other city employees She warned that women must continue their fight for abortion even though it is legal because of the strong campaign to outlaw it by religious and conservative political groups The real point of the whole terrorism against abortion clinics is to try to push women back down again she asserted The Government should be doing something about the bombing of these clinics The honorary doctorate of humane letters that Miss Friedan received on May 19 from the State University of at Stony Brook was her second honorary degree She also has one from Smith College her alma mater I started out to be an academic she said a wistful smile crossing her face I was going to be a psychologist in research and theory I did a year of graduate work at Berkeley but didnt finish because I thought Im not going to have that kind of intellectual career That was the time of the feminine mystique She said the fact that two of her books The Feminine Mystique and The Second Stage are used as texts at some colleges helped assuage her guilt about her academic incompletion She has also been a visiting professor or fellow at a number of colleges including Yale Harvard Columbia and Temple Universities and Queens College Miss Friedan is currently working on her fourth book The Fountain of Age which she said she hopes will break through the age mystique Everything I learned from the woman thing Im using here and more so she said Its both painful and exhilarating because Im at a new jumpingoff point in my own life Her second book It Changed My Life will be reissued in June by W W Norton with a new introduction Its the new mellower Betty she said with a smile Im at peace with myself in the introduction She has also become more interested in herself as both a woman and a Jew and she is cochairman of the National Commission for Womens Equality of the American Jewish Congress This is relatively new she said My feminism led me to it It started when I was asked to keynote a dialogue in Israel last year called Woman as Jew Jew as Woman  Her recent trip to Munich to protest President Reagans visit to Bitburg was under the auspices of the American Jewish Congress She and others laid a wreath on the graves of Sophie and Hans Scholl leaders of the underground student movement who were executed by the Nazis She also attended a memorial service in Dachau In the same year Hitler took away the very humanity of the Jews she said angrily he also outlawed the feminist movement and took away from women the right to hold political office and professional jobs He reduced them to kinder kirche and kuche Another fairly new role for Miss Friedan is that of grandmother which she calls a very satisfying thing The mother of three grown children she is also the grandmother of Raphael Friedan age 3 who visits her frequently in Sag Harbor Hes such a loving marvelous bundle of life she said Ive got to find him a little tent this weekend He just loves hiding places and I have to go find one
WOMEN'S CAUCUS: EIGHT YEARS OF PROGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/27/style/women-s-caucus-eight-years-of-progress.html,The Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues eight years old this month is preparing for a new battle  a fight to win legislative approval of the Economic Equity Act of 1985 The ominibus measure which consists of 22 pieces of legislation affecting women was introduced in the House on May 13 by Representative Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado and in the Senate by Senators Dave Durenberger Republican of Minnesota and Gary Hart Democrat of Colorado The individual bills deal with such issues as pay equity nondiscrimination in insurance improving pensions for military spouses and child care in public housing Each of the bills will be introduced separately and members of the caucus will be fighting for them at each step along the way It is an example of how the caucus functions said Anne Radigan executive director of the 125member group Members at Each Door Last year for example as members of the House of Representatives filed onto the floor for a vote on two childcare measures they found a member of the caucus stationed at each of the nine doors of the chamber with handouts and a message Vote yes The measure passed and the caucus will be using similar tactics this year When necessary we can be very very visible said Mrs Radigan She and three other staff members work out of a faded but elegant room once known as the ladies retiring room in the Rayburn Office Building It is one of the 70odd caucus groups of varying sizes that operate on Capitol Hill in both the House and Senate ranging from the Clearinghouse on the Future to groups whose main concerns are ports borders and even mushrooms Caucuses can consist only of members of the Senate or the House although staff members are hired from the outside In 1977 15 of the 18 women then in Congress founded the Congresswomens Caucus In 1981 it began admitting men and became the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues Today 110 men are caucus members and of the 25 women in Congress 15 are caucus members Although the caucus is nonpartisan its membership is heavily Democratic 5 of the 15 women who are members are Repubicans as are 10 of the 110 men Members do not generally rush around the halls of Congress buttonholing their peers For the most part they vigorously press their legislative agenda through more traditional avenues briefings a monthly newsletter that goes to 4500 people and testimony before Congressional committees along with some oneonone lobbying Mrs Radigan said that in addition to the Economic Equity Act another priority for the caucus this session is passage of the Civil Rights Restoration Act a bipartisan measure that has been introduced in both houses Among other things the bill would restore the full effect of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 which prohibited sex discrimination at institutions receiving Federal aid Its not easy  you just have to keep nibbling away said Representative Olympia J Snowe Republican of Maine She and Representative Schroeder head the caucuss executive committee There are so many issues that members of Congress are involved in or concentrating on in a general session that its a mark of success when you can even draw attention to a specific issue Representative Snowe said The Selection of Issues We try to select issues that generally will not divide our members she explained For instance we dont force abortion as an issue for the caucus An informal look at how caucus members have voted on abortion issues indicates a lack of consensus We sit down and develop strategies and priorities to get as many of the statutes through Congress as possible Representative Snowe said Weve tried to develop a network among ourselves We divide up the committees in question we have vote counters Democrats lobby Democrats Republicans lobby Republicans and we try to keep everyone abreast of when they should be on the floor fighting for votes The Federal legislative process moves slowly and victories are few and far between Some bills are introduced year after year before passage But in recent years the caucus has been able to point to some successes Over 300 bills were introduced on womens issues in the last Congress two times more than in the 19811982 session according to caucus records and more than 100 hearings were held on topics important to women Seventeen new laws involving womens equity were enacted in 198384 session including two major measures pension reform and childsupport enforcement An Effort to Gain Support The 1981 decision to change the name of the caucus and admit men was an effort to broaden its base and gain financial support  new House rules banned private fund raising for caucuses using Federal facilities Among the men who have joined are Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr William H Gray 3d chairman of he House Budget Committee and Morris K Udall Democratic of Arizona As associate members men pay 750 a year in dues The women pay 1500 and operate as the executive committee of the caucus Representative Jim Moody Democrat of Wisconsin was among the members who turned out recently for a dinner following a performance of The Italian Lesson starring Jean Stapleton at the Kennedy Center The evening was to salute the caucus on its eighth anniversary and to raise funds for its research arm the Womens Research and Education Institute which provides members with data on womens issues Miss Stapleton is president of the institutes board of directors Men have a great deal to gain by the shattering of sex stereotypes on both sides of the line said Representative Moody who is cosponsor with Representative Lindy Boggs a Louisiana Democrat of a bill that calls for the examination of problems facing women who own businesses I think it will be a more interesting world when both men and women are free to move across previously rigid borders Mr Moody said Across the Kennedy Center atrium another caucus member Claude Pepper an 84yearold Democrat from Florida hailed Betty Parsons Dooley executive director of the institute I was 20 years old when women got the right to vote he said with a laugh so Ive seen it all The preponderance of Democratic members has caused occasional problems for Republican members of the caucus Representative Lynn Martin Republican of Illinois who has been involved on a number of issues important to women resigned She had decided she said that the caucus was too partisan and at times was used to get press attention by caucus members who had views I didnt share I Disagree Totally on Spending As a member of the House Budget Committee Representative Martin supported Adminstration efforts to cut back such programs as food stamps and subsidized school lunches I agree on matters like the ERA she said but I disagree totally on spending and the caucus line of more and more spending hardly reflects my views But Representative Claudine Schneider Republican of Rhode Island who joined the caucus when first elected in 1980 said I feel the caucus has real value One of the purposes it serves is that it gives me an opportunity to talk and exchange ideas with other women whom I dont see that much of since we are not on the same committees she explained We share many of the same priorities and I find it helpful to get together to develop strategies and to move legislation
Abortion Mischief,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/27/opinion/abortion-mischief.html,Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah says hes found a way to strike a blow for efficiency To avoid the annual Congressional wrangle over abortion he would ban Federal funding for abortions permanently The unacceptable price of such efficiency however would be new legal confusion Congress has since 1976 restricted Federal funding for abortions under Medicaid health insurance for the poor An amendment originally sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois has been regularly attached to appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services Currently it prohibits use of Federal funds to pay for an abortion except to save the mothers life Senator Hatch now wants to make the Hyde amendment permanent by attaching its meaning to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the landmark law that prohibits racial discrimination in public accommodations and private employment Title VI of the act forbids discrimination on the basis of race color or national origin in federally funded programs like those for transportation education and housing Why not add the abortion ban Because of the potential for legal conflict The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution protects against racial discrimination but also that it guarantees a womans right to an abortion Prohibitions on Federal funding for racially discriminatory programs are based on wide agreement about the civil rights of human beings But there is no such agreement about the rights of a nonviable fetus In addition a Hyde amendment attached to the broadly restrictive Title VI could easily be abused It could be interpreted to prohibit hospitals that receive Federal research funds from performing all abortions not just those for Medicaid patients It would be especially mischievous if attached to the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1985 a bill designed not to raise new issues but merely to correct a Supreme Court ruling that too narrowly construed the coverage of civil rights laws Annual approval of the Hyde amendment through the appropriations process avoids any backdoor evasion of Congressional intent It also permits the flexibility to accommodate changing views Even opponents of abortion might someday want to consider more exceptions to the funding ban which now bars Washington from paying even when pregnancy results from rape or incest Senator Hatchs proposal would promote rights for the unborn that directly contradict the Courts abortion rulings and restrict access to abortion far more than Congress has so far desired The issue is difficult enough without such new mischief
MEDICAL GAINS FOUND TO ERODE ABORTION RULING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/29/us/medical-gains-found-to-erode-abortion-ruling.html,Medical advances in the art of keeping fetuses alive are eroding the Supreme Courts abortion decisions and raising troubling questions for mothers and doctors a panel of experts said here today But the rate of the advances has been greatly exaggerated and may actually be slowing several panelists asserted at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science As a result two panelists argued it is unlikely that further medical advances will make it necessary any time soon to constrict a womans right to have an abortion as guaranteed by previous Supreme Court decisions The Supreme Courts landmark 1973 abortion decision Roe v Wade held that women had the right to obtain an abortion up until the point where a fetus would be viable or able to survive outside the womb with artificial medical aid if it was delivered At the time of the decision the point of viability was about 28 weeks after conception Effects of Medical Advances But over the succeeding 12 years medical advances such as neonatal intensivecare units respirators to help the fetus breathe and drug treatments to enhance the functioning of its lungs have steadily lowered the point at which a fetus is viable It is now about 24 or 25 weeks The steady advance of medical technology is already raising some troubling questions for women and doctors several panelists agreed Nancy K Rhoden an assistant professor at the Ohio State University law school noted that it was usually not possible using current methods of amniocentesis to diagnose whether a fetus has crippling defects until 20 weeks or more after conception She said that if there was the slightest delay in detection for any reason a woman might not know her fetus was defective until after the 24th week when it is now probably difficult for her to obtain an abortion because the fetus would be deemed viable A new experimental diagnostic test chorionic villi biopsy may alleviate the problem somewhat by detecting some defects much earlier she added but the test will not detect neural tube defects and is not a total solution Dr Robert H Hayashi past president of the Society of Perinatal Obstetrics said advances in making younger fetuses viable have also put obstetricians on the horns of a dilemma by making it more likely that a fetus aborted in the middle stages of pregnancy will be born live and capable of survival if given proper treatment He said he had no statistics on how often this happened Professor Rhoden noted that as the time of viability grows earlier it appears that the time in which a woman can obtain an abortion will steadily shrink Indeed Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor of the Supreme Court joined by two colleagues has already warned that fetal viability the point at which the state can prohibit abortions altogether is approaching conception She suggested that the Supreme Courts landmark decision is clearly on a collision course with itself and might need rethinking Statistics Are Cited But Nan Hunter an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union said that both the news media and the Justices had exaggerated the importance of the medical advances She said 99 percent of all abortions were performed within 20 weeks after conception well before a fetus has become viable and that many of the remaining 1 percent could be performed earlier too if impoverished or illinformed women were made aware of their medical possibilities She and Dr Hayashi agreed that there was little chance of any substantial lowering of the point of viability in the immediate future Unless some sort of artificial womb is invented Dr Hayashi said I dont see any substantial lowering of viability Richard G Wilkins assistant professor of law at the Brigham Young University Law School in Provo Utah who helped write the Reagan Administrations brief in a recent abortion case said he thought the High Court had erred by granting too much power to the medical profession to determine the point at which abortions are permissible or not He urged that state legislatures be allowed to regulate abortions under broad judicial guidelines
200 ARRESTED IN WASHINGTON PROTESTS CALLED BY CHRISTIAN ACTIVISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/29/us/200-arrested-in-washington-protests-called-by-christian-activists.html,About 200 Christian activists were arrested today in demonstrations outside the White House the Soviet Embassy and other major buildings in Washington They were among more than 1000 people protesting on a number of issues including nuclear policy war in Central America the death penalty and Federal budget cuts Organizers said the arrests were the culmination of a national gathering on Christian nonviolence and civil disobedience Jim Wallis one of the organizers said that through the breadth of the protest we hope to serve notice that wherever there are policies of violence militarism and injustice they will be resisted by the churches No altercations were reported in connection with the arrests The police searched the demonstrators bound their hands with plastic ties and escorted them to airconditioned buses on a hot humid day All the arrests were for misdemeanors Arrests at White House At the White House the Federal Park Police said 78 people were arrested and given 50 tickets on charges of demonstrating without a permit They had knelt on the sidewalk singing civil rights songs such as We Shall Overcome and praying aloud Lord we ask you to stop this terrible arms race At the Soviet Embassy about 30 demonstrators were taken into custody by the Washington police and charged with unlawfully protesting within 500 feet of an embassy About 50 demonstrators at the Supreme Court denounced the death penalty calling for the Court to unchain the shackles of gruesome killing Twelve people were arrested after they knelt on the marble plaza in front of the building About 20 demonstrators were taken into custody at the Department of Health and Human Services This is a joining of people deeply concerned about the evil of abortion and the rights of women said Molly Rush of Pittsburgh a spokesman for the group at that department building She said they were also concerned about budgets cuts under the Reagan Administration To say that youre prolife and at the same time add four million children to the poverty rolls is a contradiction she said At the South African Embassy the scene of numerous protests in recent months against that countrys policy of racial separation 29 people were arrested for demonstrating within the 500foot limit Christianity Emphasized The protesters emphasized their Christian ties calling their demonstrations Peace Pentecost 1985 in commemoration of the first Pentecost a time when Christians believe the Holy Spirit empowered the disciples to speak boldly of Christ after his death The demonstrators efforts were dismissed though by the Rev Jerry Falwell president of Moral Majority In a news conference Mr Falwell called the demonstrators pseudo evangelicals and said their leadership is to evangelism what Adolf Hitler was to the Roman Catholic Church
SELECTING A BABY'S SEX: STILL NO CERTAIN METHOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/30/garden/selecting-a-baby-s-sex-still-no-certain-method.html,FOR most couples pregnancy is a time of anticipation Is it a boy or girl is it healthy who will it resemble A small number of couples however want to take the mystery out of pregnancy They want their child to be a particular sex and they are willing to pay thousands of dollars listen to anybody or try any method that promises to change the odds of conceiving a boy or girl By using special douches charting body temperatures or having sperm treated before the mother is inseminated the couple is told a child of the coveted sex will be born According to an informal survey of obstetricians fertility experts and experimental geneticists from around the country these couples are mostly being fooled by false promises No sex preselection method has yet been proven effective according to the rigorous standards of professional medical journals And those who promote the various techniques say that none are guaranteed Techniques that rely on separating sperm have not been show to work in humans said Dr Kurt Hirschhorn chairman of pediatrics at the Mt Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan Methods that require women to follow set regimens prior to conception do not succeed either according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology But if a sexselection technique ever is perfected medical experts say the ethical and social consequences could be disturbing According to the demographer Dr Charles Westoff of Princeton University studies show that most Americans want a boy and a girl in that order If we had a technology available to predetermine the sex ratio of children it would not have any dramatic effect on the sex ratio overall Dr Westoff said But the order of birth would change dramatically The number of male firstborns with little sisters would double he said The implications are anybodys guess Dr Westoff said Birth order is widely believed to affect personality academic achievement and later success in life An effective sex preselection technique would have even greater consequences in countries where the desire to produce male heirs is paramount Dr Westoff said Many families would choose not to have girls resulting in a rapid oversupply of boys In general he said one of the strongest preferences for boy babies is found in the Chinese culture Today many couples spend as much as 250 per month on treatments in an attempt to determine the sex of their children They explain their needs in letters such as these which were addressed to Gametrics Ltd a center in Sausalito Calif that promotes a procedure to separate sperm in an attempt to insure that male conceptions are more likely to occur From a farmers wife I dearly want another child But my husband doesnt want another girl He farms and would love to have a son to farm with him This would definitely be our last child From a woman with five sons My desire to have a daughter is still very much a part of me I guess it has been my lifes dream I guess if theres any way to have one I would From the mother of three girls We wanted a boy all three pregnancies As much as I love our girls I feel something is missing When I see my husbands eyes when he see a little boy with a baseball cap on or football shirt I ache for him He coaches midget football He loves to hunt and he collects guns He always used to say Ill save this one for my boy  From a distraught woman My husband is from the Middle East I have had three pregnancies and two girls With the third pregnancy we had an amniocentesis and it was a girl so it was aborted The pressure from my motherinlaw and my husbands sisters to have a boy is unbearable Because a couples reproductive wishes and choices are usually kept private it is hard to know how many couples today want to alter the odds in favor of having a child of a particular sex Nan Chico a sociologist at California State University at Hayward says that such a desire seems to be the exception rather than the rule Professor Chico has catalogued more than 6000 letters written to Gametrics over the last 10 years A third of the letters gave specific reasons why the couples wanted to choose the sex of their next baby The vast majority of couples Professor Chico said have two or three children of the same sex and want one more of the opposite sex Only 17 couples indicated they wanted to choose the sex of their firstborn 11 elected boys and 6 wanted girls Many couples had had children by previous marriages and wanted just one more of a specific sex in their current marriage Professor Chico said many couples think modern medicine can do anything There are embryo transfers test tube babies genetic engineering and prenatal diagnostics she said So why not sex preselection Dr Ferdinand Beernink an obstetriciangynocologist at Advanced Reproductive Services in Berkeley Calif which also offers the same sperm separation procedure developed at Gametrics said many of his clients some of whom come from abroad face cultural pressure to produce a male heir This is particularly true he said of Asians East Indians people from the Middle East and Nigerians Worldwide 106 boys are born for every 100 girls Despite their slight advantage at birth however boys have a higher infant death rate so girls soon outnumber boys The promise of sexselection techniques is that couples can alter those odds Two books on the subject have just been revised One of the books How To Choose the Sex of Your Baby by Landrum Shettles and David Rorvik is based on a finding made 25 years ago by the Dr Sophia Kleegman of New York University Medical School She discovered that for reasons still unknown more boy babies are born to women who conceive as a result of artificial insemination given on the day of ovulation or the day before ovulation Dr Shettles a specialist in reproduction and Mr Rorvik say that the same results may be obtained by women who conceive naturally at the time of ovulation They advise charting body temperature to know when ovulation occurs and to douche with liquids that are said to create a favorable environment for either male or female sperm Critics of this method say that Dr Kleegmans findings are not relevant to natural conception The other book Boy or Girl by Elizabeth Whelan appears to contradict the advice of the first book According to the book written in 1977 girls are more likely to be born when conceived close to ovulation Boys are favored when sperm are introduced earlier in the cycle the book says A spokesman for the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says that such rhythm techniques do not provide consistent predictable results Even Dr Whelan who has a PhD in public health has had second thoughts about raising the hopes of couples who want to determine the sex of their baby The honest to God truth is that we dont have an answer she said in a telephone interview Her research she said shows a slight correlation to skewing the 5050 odds in a way that could only warm the heart of a statistician I try to warn people not to accept false promises from someone wanting to make a quick buck she said Another method aimed at sex selection involves separating sperm which are produced in two varieties X and Y When an Xbearing sperm fertilizes an egg a girl is conceived A Ybearing sperm produces male embryos Sperm separation techniques try to collect sperm of one variety over the other and artificially inseminate a woman with the sperm of the desired sex Dr Ronald Ericsson founder and president of Gametrics was the first to offer such a service His semen filtering technique favors the collection of X sperm which generally swim faster than Y sperm He has licensed his method to 36 clinics around the world and says that of a total of 198 successful pregnancies 156 were boys and 42 were girls He says that the sample size is too small to prove the validity of his technique but he expects to gain more evidence as his centers expand Dr Hirschhorn of the Mt Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan said the technique has not received a proper scientific trial in man No sex selection technique will be accepted by the medical profession until scientific papers present the methods and results in a journal that requires a review by other professionals before publication Dr Hirschhorn said Nor do genetic counselors advise their patients who may carry defective genes that are only expressed in boy babies hemophilia is an example to try techniques designed to favor the birth of a girl There are potential hazards in manipulating sperm said Dr Michael Kaback director of the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling center at HarborUCLA Hospital in Los Angeles Sperm could be damaged while being handled outside the body medical experts say Other experts expressed ethical concerns Dr John Fletcher assistant for bioethics at the clinical center of the National Insitutes of Health in Besthesda Md is an expert on sex selection issues He said his views are his own and that the Federal agency has no policies on these matters I worry that these techniques could be a precedent for eugenics he said One should use medicine to treat diseases and conditions that are profound Gender is not a disease We live in an era when we ought to be careful about drawing lines in human genetics and reproduction Second he said if everyone could choose the sex of their baby it would be bad for girls If the perponderance of firstborns are boys Dr Fletcher said they would get the lions share of attention Finally he said it might lead to more abortions for sex choice While there is no evidence to support this he said some people committed to predetermination might be interested in making sure of what they got
'OLD-FASHIONED FAITH' IN RAPE CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/30/us/old-fashioned-faith-in-rape-case.html,The Rev Carl M Nannini remembers it happened just after his wife read a passage from the Old Testament to Cathleen Crowell Webb The Scripture was Leviticus If a soul sin and commit a trespass against the Lord and lie unto his neighbor Mrs Nannini read then all that about which he hath sworn falsely he shall even restore it It was then he says that Mrs Webb told Bonnie Nannini that in 1977 she falsely accused Gary Dotson of raping her setting in motion a complex legal and emotional dispute that ended May 12 with Gov James R Thompson of Illinois freeing Mr Dotson after six years in jail Like many Americans people in this small town of 4700 people where Mrs Webb now lives were confused by her recantation and wondered which story was true Even Mr Thompson who commuted Mr Dotsons sentence rather than pardon him said he thought the original story of the rape was probably the true one The worldwide attention focused on Mrs Webb and questions about her motives lead ultimately to her religious rebirth to her close personal and philosophical relationship with Mr Nannini and to the Pilgrim Baptist Church a low gray building in a forest clearing several miles outside Jaffrey There Mr Nannini denies that Mrs Webbs withdrawal of the rape charge was a fabrication For Cathy to lie now would be totally contrary to what the Bible teaches he said An OldFashioned Faith Mrs Webb in explaining her actions to the Illinois authorities said I am now a Christian fully understanding of the evil I have committed and that I must undo it to the extent possible That belief is part of the oldfashioned Baptist faith Mr Nannini says he preaches in which all are sinners until they are saved not only by a personal conversion to faith in Jesus but also by confession and repentance Guilt is a word he uses frequently in conversation God gives repentance to those who admit their sins he said That is what happened to Mrs Webb Mr Nannini a 39yearold onetime chemist from Wisconsin who likes to desribe himself as a missionary now acts as Mrs Webbs spokesman He said she was too tired to conduct any more interviews Similarity in Backgrounds He and Mrs Webb were both reared as Roman Catholics in the Middle West and both moved to New Hampshire in the late 1970s Mrs Webb and her husband David were attracted to Mr Nanninis church after a Biblereading session and became bornagain Christians under his tutelage eventually moving 20 miles to live closer to his church Two years ago Mrs Webbs mother dying of cancer stayed in the Nanninis house during her last weeks And this spring after Mrs Webb told the Nanninis the rape story Mr Nannini arranged to get a lawyer for her and accompanied her to Chicago three times A bearded man of medium stature who speaks with quiet determination Mr Nannini sees a biblical parallel to the WebbDotson case It is in Genesis part of the story of Joseph who is sold into slavery in Egypt and is made a servant in the house of a rich Egyptian The Egyptians wife lusts after Joseph and urges him to lie with me When he refuses the woman falsely accuses him of raping her and he is thrown into prison In the end Joseph is freed by the Pharaoh Emily Preston the minister of a United Church of Christ here who has been at odds with Mr Nannini in other matters says this biblical allusion with its stress on the womans fault is an example of Mr Nanninis belief in the subservience of women Dispute on Womens Role Miss Preston says she does not believe Mrs Webbs story that the rape never happened And although she has never met Mrs Webb Miss Preston suggests that a factor in the decision to recant was her fundamentalist churchs emphasis on guilt and its beliefs about women As for Mr Nannini he makes no secret of his distaste for the femininist movement and his opposition to womens serving as ministers The Bible sets limits to a womans role he says Thats nothing against women Women he believes should stay home to rear children There is nothing dishonorable about that he said But now our children are being raised by baby sitters and day care centers without discipline Its no wonder our society is in trouble He said that feminism was part of the secular humanism that was responsible for such ills as drugs teenage pregnancies and abortions Ministers Ongoing Dispute In one sense Miss Prestons assertion is the latest episode in a continuing feud between Mr Nannini and other ministers in the area rooted in deep theological and personal differences Mr Nanninis Pilgrim Baptist Church is one of three fundamentalist congregations that have sprung up here in the past four years while Miss Prestons Congregationalism is the historic faith of New England and lies in the mainstream of liberal Protestantism Members of Mr Nanninis church have frequently visited the homes of other people here to attack their churches for being unChristian according to Miss Preston who is also the head of the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union She said several pastors expressed concern about the aggressive tactics of Mr Nanninis church at a meeting of ministers from the southern New Hampshire area recently Aloof From Other Pastors Mr Nannini wrote a column for The New Hampshire Sunday News one of the avowedly rightwing Manchester newspapers for several years occasionally attacking civil libertarians and the fallacy that one can get to Heaven by doing good works But he is little known in Jaffrey where residents say he keeps a distance from the community I dont know him said the Rev Roland Mitcheson the pastor of the Jaffrey Bible Church another of the new congregations He stays aloof from other pastors in the area Mr Nannini first came to New Hampshire in 1978 with support from the Faith Baptist Church in Oconomowoc Wis another independent Baptist church The minister there Rev Leonard Frydenlund remembers Mr Nannini as being very intelligent with a photographic memory Mr Nannini chose New Hampshire Mr Frydenlund recalled because he felt there was a need for him there and the Lord picked out the area Mrs Webb who moved to New Hampshire because her older brother owned a successful steelworking firm there was one of Mr Rev Nanninis early converts She was born again three and a half years ago he related but at the time she was only a baby Christian He added that like baby humans she wasnt yet capable of a whole lot and she was still afraid to come forward about Mr Dotson

ITALY AND POPE RATIFY A NEW CONCORDAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/04/world/italy-and-pope-ratify-a-new-concordat.html,The Vatican and Italy ratified a historic pact today ending Roman Catholicism as a state religion in Italy Pope John Paul II said the new churchstate treaty known as a concordat was a sign that Catholicism respected Italys independence but he added that the church reserved the right to speak out on political and moral issues Prime Minister Bettino Craxi went to the Vatican for the ceremony in his first official visit since taking office He declared that the new concordat exalts religious freedom and the freedom of the church The new treaty replaces the Lateran Pact of 1929 which was negotiated by Mussolini and created the independent state of Vatican City on 109 acres of land in Rome Pope Lost Papal States in 1870 For 11 centuries the Pope had held secular authority over the Papal States a country that cut a swath through central Italy But the Vatican was deprived of its land in 1870 as part of the unification of Italy under the royal house of Savoy The Pope refused to recognize the loss and the issue was resolved only in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty The new accord affirms the independence of Vatican City but ends a number of privileges the Catholic Church had in Italy including its status as the state church The pact first agreed to in February 1984 and approved this year by the Italian Parliament is important not only for its provisions but as a recognition of the secularization of Italian society Although more than 90 percent of Italians are baptized Catholics only 30 percent attend Sunday Mass In two tests over the last decade voters rejected pressure from the Catholic hierarchy and supported legalizing divorce and abortion Rome No Longer Sacred City The new treaty guarantees religious freedom for nonCatholics and ends Romes status as a sacred city This title had permitted the Vatican to object to striptease parlors and pornography shops and had on occasion led to the banning of books or plays offensive to Catholicism In recent years the Vatican had been making less use of this power The new pact still recognizes the particular significance of Rome to Roman Catholicism It also establishes stricter rules on tax exemptions for religious institutions and gradually ends state subsidies for members of the clergy These will end in 1990 though the accord provides tax benefits to Italians who contribute to paying clerical salaries Another provision ends compulsory Catholic instruction in public schools though it can continue on an optional basis Parents used to need special permission to exempt children Now parents will be asked annually whether they want their children to receive religious instruction The accord transfers ownership of the Jewish catacombs from the Vatican Vaticansupported excavations there have been a source of friction between Catholics and Jews The pact was reached by Italys fiveparty coalition The coalition dominated by the proCatholic Christian Democrats is headed by Prime Minister Craxi whose Socialist Party has been a bulwark of anticlericalism The treaty had the support of the Communists who saw it as a way of further diminishing what they regarded as a politically destructive fight between Catholics and the left It was opposed by a small coalition that included both the extreme left and procapitalist Liberals Both groups felt that the new treaty still enshrined too many privileges for the church Mr Craxi and the Vatican Secretary of State Agostino Cardinal Casaroli exchanged documents and pens at a formal ceremony at the Vatican Later Mr Craxi met with the Pope and the two men underlined the historic nature of the accord Today opens a new period in the institutional relations between the church and the state in Italy John Paul said
PRESTIGIOUS FORUM SLIDES INTO TROUBLING DECLINE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/04/science/prestigious-forum-slides-into-troubling-decline.html,The onceproud titan of American scientific forums  the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  is in sharp troubling decline Over the past decade and a half attendance at what was once routinely described as the world series of science has dropped 70 percent and much of the passion and fervor has ebbed as well The latest meeting held in Los Angeles last week attracted only about 2300 registrants far below the peak attendance of about 8000 in 1969 The facts are no matter how you want to twist them or turn them that attendance has just gone down terribly said Arthur Herschman head of the AAAS meetings office This years meeting is as bad as weve had in 30 years The action has shifted elsewhere in the association and in all of American science leaving the big general scientific convention one of the most venerable forums of communication in the long history of science in increasingly difficult straits No one is quite sure what factors are at work but there is a sense that the increasing specialization of science is eroding the popularity of big general meetings that consider scientific and public policy issues of interest to a broad range of scientists not just those from a narrow specialty The American Physical Society has experienced an even more drastic decline in attendance at its big general meetings which are designed to appeal to a broad range of physicists Attendance last January fell to a low of 800 partly because of bad weather from a high of about 7000 registrants in 1967 The general meetings are just disappearing says William W Havens Jr executive secretary of the physical society Weve concluded that the only way to have a successful meeting is to have specialized topics The physical societys two dozen small topical conferences typically attended by 150 to 300 physicists from a single discipline are thriving for example but they deal with such highly specialized topics as basic properties of optical materials or radiofrequency plasma heating The great danger in the decline of the general meetings many scientists say is that future generations of researchers will lose the crossfertilizing benefits of learning what scientists in other fields are doing They may also lose the opportunity to engage in important policy debates about the impact of their work on society Last weeks AAAS meeting was a typical smorgasbord of important topics pre sented at some 160 different symposiums spread over two large convention hotels The weeklong sessions on arms control including the Reagan Administrations Strategic Defense Initiative commonly called Star Wars were more popular than most sessions often drawing 200 or more scientists The latest advances in neurosciences including work not yet published were discussed at some of the most exciting scientific sessions And other symposiums delved into the psychology of early adolescence daycare quality supercomputers alcoholism genetic disease evolution urban ecology Halleys Comet and the sign language of apes to name a few from among hundreds Its been a remarkable meeting one of the best in terms of content said William D Carey executive officer of the AAAS The quality control has been very good But much of the material also had a stale quality some AAAS officials lamented No major new scientific discoveries were announced Those are now presented at the more specialized meetings where there is a critical mass of other experts who can understand and applaud them And the public policy discussions largely rehashed debates that have already long been aired in the scientific and general media Perhaps the most dramatic change in AAAS meetings over the past two decades has been a sense of ebbing vitality In the 1960s and into the 1970s the sense of ferment and excitement of being at the heart of important national debates was palpable Corridors in the convention hotels were jammed with scientists and students of all ages Network television bathed the participants in stark lights with reporters grabbing eminent scientists for quick interviews Spirited arguments lasted late into the night on such issues as military technology the Vietnam War environmental pollution and toxic hazards There was a sense of history being made on the scene Edward Teller a principal developer of the hydrogen bomb facing down a roomful of hostile students in a vain effort to explain his view of the Soviet menace former Vice President Hubert H Humphrey addressing the convention Matthew Meselson the Harvard biologist almost singlehandedly stopping the American military campaign to defoliate the trees of Vietnam with herbicidal chemicals simply by issuing a report on the environmental and health damage the chemicals were causing By contrast the meeting last week was so serene it conveyed a sense of being on the sidelines Although discussion at the formal sessions was often of high quality the corridors were typically barren Network television was nowhere to be seen no highlevel Government officials appeared to lecture the scientific community on its responsibilities reporters had difficulty finding stories they felt were important and many sessions drew only sparse audiences A session on fetal viability one of the hottest topics in the nationwide debate over abortion drew fewer people than a news conference on the same subject A session on the ethics of animal research an emotional issue that is splitting many campuses drew not a hint of attention from animal rights groups The closest thing to dissension came when a young woman was asked to leave the room when her pet bird chirped In the 60s and 70s AAAS meetings were magnets of controversy  you could get an argument in every corridor said Mr Carey But in Los Angeles he added you can hardly detect it if you get down on the floor and put your ear to the ground You cant hear any noise Nobody in the AAAS wants a return of the petty disruptions that disturbed some meetings in the past but virtually all lament the loss of vitality in recent conventions Another troubling trend Dr Herschman said is that a large percentage of those people who attended or gave papers last week were whitehaired veterans of the scientific community long past the stage of active scientific work The young scientist who is doing the exciting experiment isnt at this meeting he said His boss is Or his bosss boss Press coverage is also down though not as sharply as overall attendance About 400 people registered at the press room last week half of them journalists and half public relations officials journalism teachers and students Almost 700 registered in New York the year before It bothers me more that there are fewer reporters here than that the attendance is down Dr Herschman said noting that one of the prime purposes of the meeting is to improve the publics understanding of science Nobody is sure what factors are behind the decline Some may be easily fixed The strike against United Airlines the official carrier for the convention undoubtedly discouraged some who suddenly found their lowcost advance purchase tickets invalidated The timing of the meeting starting on the Memorial Day holiday undoubtedly dissuaded others And the tightening economic conditions in science made it difficult for many to obtain travel money Some even question if the decline is real The absence of guards at the doors in recent years has allowed an untold number to sneak in without registering and paying a fee They are there but are not counted in the attendance totals But many AAAS officials wonder uneasily whether more fundamental factors are at work They fear that young scientists reflecting broader trends in society are becoming more careeroriented than ever and are thus putting prime attention on their specialties while ignoring broader scientific or societal issues The AAAS itself has gradually been directing its energies away from the annual meeting toward other activities Its distinguished scientific journal Science is surging in new directions under a new editor Its publication for a general audience Science 85 has become the best of the new science magazines for laymen Its annual analysis of the Federal research budget has become an indispensable tool for analysts of government policy New programs have been started to improve the quality of precollege science and mathematics education and to examine issues involving population resources and the environment And a small galaxy of AAAS committees have been turning out solid reports on scientific freedom and national security human rights and arms control Ive watched the center of gravity shifting away from the annual meeting itself as the flagship activity of the AAAS says Mr Carey who has been executive officer for the past decade Theres a whole new frontier of things emerging in AAAS at the same time that the annual meeting itself is hanging on and wondering whats happened to it Mr Carey has appointed a committee to investigate the causes of declining attendance and to propose changes to reinvigorate the meeting But for the time being few expect drastic change David A Hamburg chairmaan of the AAAS board said he would very much like to preserve the essence of the annual meeting its breadth its scope its coverage of science and the social uses of science Its a window on the whole world of science he said Its the one place I know of where you can get a glance at all that science does in intelligible and comprehensive form
SMEAL AND GOLDSMITH FIGHT FOR LEADERSHIP OF NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/08/style/smeal-and-goldsmith-fight-for-leadership-of-now.html,The decision by Eleanor C Smeal once president of the National Organization for Women to challenge her successor Judy Goldsmith for leadership of the 250000member organization has led to a spirited campaign that is now moving into high gear Both candidates are touring the country to line up support of delegates to the national convention which will be held next month in New Orleans Some of the approximately 2550 delegates have already been selected others remain to be named Because of the election which will be held July 20 attendance at the convention is expected to be unusually high When Mrs Smeal confirmed her intention to run three weeks ago she ended several months of speculation and rumor Although incumbents have been challenged before by seeking to recapture the office she held from April 1977 through October 1982 Mrs Smeal injected a new note into the race for one of the most powerful positions in the womens rights movement The organization has 800 chapters and an annual budget of 65 million Differences on Tactics Not Issues In a recent telephone interview from her office in Washington Mrs Smeal discussed her motivation in challenging the woman she supported in 1982 She said she and Mrs Goldsmith differed not on the philosophical concepts of equal rights but on the political realities of how to obtain them fully In fact the emphasis of the campaign so far appears to be on the tactical approaches of the candidates to issues rather than the issues themselves Mrs Smeal said the initiative for the race had come from a number of supporters who had been urging her to run since January The major impetus she said was a wish that NOW become more outspoken assertive and publicly active on a number of issues Among the issues she said she intends to raise are a legislative prohibition against discrimination in schools that get Federal funds abortion rights the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution and the Vaticans policy on reproduction and on the role of women in the church In some ways the approaches of the candidates are exemplified by their plans for renewing the campaign for an equal rights amendment Mrs Smeal said she favored a national program for direct action now This cant wait for another 10 years she said We cant decide that we want it and then do nothing For Mrs Goldsmith the Time Is Not Right On the same issue Mrs Goldsmith said in an interview It is on our agenda but it is not the most propitious time to bring it up We are not interested in exercises in futility We must change the political landscape and get more women elected before we try again She said Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committees subcommittee on the Constitution could kill the move in the Senate singlehanded Addressing the matter of the strength of her leadership Mrs Goldsmith said from the groups Washington headquarters Loud may be good but it is not only the level of decibels that is heard I think we have made history in the last two years she continued Without NOW I dont think there would have been a woman Vice Presidential candidate Outside the electoral arena we have reestablished a broad base of issues reproductive rights pay equity pensions insurance child care combating violence against women We have conducted a massive voter registration campaign and our vigils on abortion rights have been highly successful We have become more effective in lobbying and in forming coalitions with other civil rights groups Mrs Smeal now a political consultant served five and a half years as president longer than any of the five other leaders of the 19yearold organization While the NOW constitution limits service to two consecutive twoyear terms her second term was extended so that efforts for ratification of the equal rights amendment would not be interrupted The constitution does not bar returning to office later When Mrs Smeal left office she openly supported Mrs Goldsmith a former national vice president Mrs Goldsmith won a fiveway race her first term which would have ended last November has also been extended in order to return to a normal election schedule according to NOW officials In her presidency Mrs Goldsmith exercised a significant influence on Walter F Mondale in his decision to choose a woman as his running mate Although Mrs Goldsmith and Mrs Smeal both are considered strong candidates and both have impassioned supporters it is too early to tell how much of a division the race might carve in NOWs rank and file or whether it will provoke bitterness a consequence that both candidates say they hope to avoid In fact members of the national board voted last weekend to carry out two longrange programs  one on reproductive rights the other a campaign for an omnibus civil rights restoration act  over a period that extends beyond the election This shows that the organization is not being rent asunder by the campaign and is moving forward with its actions said Patricia Ireland NOWs southeast regional director and Mrs Smeals campaign manager However feelings run strong in behalf of both candidates and some members say that Mrs Smeal should not have entered the race At a NOW reception before Mrs Smeals candidacy was declared Betty Friedan a founder of the organization was asked about the possibility that Mrs Smeal would run again This is simply the wrong race at this time in our history when womens rights are under attack by the Reagan Administration she said So I deplore the wastage of energy in unnecessary power battles There is no builtin lifetime presidency and it is only right that Judy Goldsmith have another term But Linda Bowker an assistant state coordinator for New Jersey NOW and a Smeal supporter said The fact that shes a former president is what gives her a track record Were also telling the world that we want choices There is too the sentiment expressed by Susan Lombard director of membership recruitment for New York NOW This is heartbreaking because I love them both she said They are both excellent administrators Miss Lombard said she did not object to Mrs Smeals running NOW has grown and changed she said I can understand her wanting to come back and give more

NEW GROUP TO AID FEMALE CANDIDATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/09/nyregion/new-group-to-aid-female-candidates.html,A COMMITTEE has been formed to offer financial help to female candidates for state office who support economic political educational and social parity issues of concern to women According to Patricia Connolly Gentile of Clinton Township president of the group the Womens Political Action Committee of New Jersey the idea of helping female candidates financially was generated almost simultaneously by members of two different groups of business and professional women One night some of us got together and we started talking about womens involvement in politics Mrs Gentile said We discussed why there werent more women in public office and why we werent involved We decided to do something  to form a completely different organization by drawing from other groups in the area In a sense this group is very narrow in scope We are one group going after one target for one purpose to collect funds and distribute them to women running for office in New Jersey Not every female candidate will receive financial support Mrs Gentile said Candidates will be screened by a selection committee before getting endorsements and funds Just because a woman is running for office doesnt mean she will get our funds Mrs Gentile said She really has to support issues of importance to women such as child care pay parity the equal rights amendment and the right to choose in the abortion issue Although the group will start out by simply supporting candidates running for state office Mrs Gentile said plans include eventually supporting women on the county and municipal levels in both primary and general elections There are now 3 women in the 40member State Senate and 9 in the 80member Assembly In addition 14 percent of county Freeholders are women 9 percent are mayors and 138 percent are municipal officers Over all women comprise 128 percent of elected officials in New Jersey according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute for Politics at Rutgers the State University If women in New Jersey are to take their proper place in town and city halls county administration buildings and the State House itself Mrs Gentile said it will only be because we help ourselves Much of the work of the statewide nonpartisan group will be educational Women Mrs Gentile said shy away from politics believing it is a field that is somewhat disreputable The committee wants to change that We want to tell women that it is good for them to get involved that is a step we must now take she said Since members of the committee will evaluate the female candidates carefully before supporting them financially women who wish to give to candidates who espouse their causes will have the assurance of knowing where their money is going Mrs Gentile said Once we get over that she added we can say that its OK to give 10 but better to give 50 If we can give a woman candidate a substantial amount we can have a tremendous impact Plans for raising funds are still under discussion but Mrs Gentile said she believed that much of the money would be raised in events held in peoples homes and that these small meetings of 20 to 30 people would be educational too Dr Gloria Gertzman of Bridgewater president of the New Jersey Association of Women Dentists is a member of the new organizations board of directors and its selection committee She believes Dr Gertzman said that an endorsement from the committee will have even more effect than its financial support Our financial endorsement will go a long way she said and we want that to be significant but our endorsement itself will have an even greater effect If we decline endorsement that will also say something  that we have researched the candidate and concluded that her views on women and womens issues do not warrant our support As someone in a profession dominated by men Dr Gertzman said she has had sufficient experience to know that women need help in getting into nontraditional areas One of these she said is politics I recognize that women in this kind of position really need support she said To a certain extent they are novices An organization such as this can help them grow into the role in a much more rapid rate The major strength of the group Dr Gertzman said is that it is so broadly based both along geographical and socioeconomic lines Among the reasons there are so few women in political office Dr Gertzman added is a lack of encouragement and adequate financial support Once women see there is a political action committee formulated specifically to help them she said we believe the number of women candidates will increase For further information write to the committee at PO Box 170 Edison 08818
THE BAPTIST SCHISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/09/magazine/the-baptist-schism.html,PASTOR GEORGE H Gaston came home to Houston from the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention last summer feeling that his congregation had been slapped in the face At the meeting a resolution had been passed condemning the ordination of women as deacons and ministers basing its action on passages in the Bible Several years before the convocation and after prayer and consulting the Scripture Willow Meadows Baptist Church had ordained three women deacons and one woman chaplain in the traditional Baptist way by a vote of the congregation The resolution was in no way binding and Willow Meadows ordained another woman after the resolution Southern Baptists have no ecclesiastical hierarchy and believe in the autonomy of local churches Thus they come together at an annual business meeting to deal with the intricacies of cooperative giving Binding or not the resolution was yet another sign to Gaston that the Southern Baptist Conventions tradition of individualism and liberty of conscience was being threatened The threats came he observed from conservative fundamentalists who believe in what they call the inerrancy of the Bible These fundamentalists or inerrantists frequently allude to Jesuss statement in Matthew 518 that until the world ends one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled The whole issue says Paige Patterson a leading inerrantist theologian is over whether or not what the Bible reports historically and theologically and scientifically and philosophically is really the case The controversy reflects the national conservative trend of the last decade At its center is the problem of defining and preserving the family in what conservatives see as a culture increasingly fragmented chaotic and narcissistic However unlike other social groups and institutions that have moved toward conservatism Southern Baptists have been to the right of center for the last 150 years In the Southern Baptists internal realignment almost all of the fundamentalists political issues have to do with family life  abortion the role of women school prayer Fundamentalist seminaries teach counseling as well as the Bible their larger churches have counselors who help people deal with their sex lives as well as their spiritual lives When a fundamentalist minister recently preached about what awaits those who are not saved he talked not of the physical suffering of hell but of the psychological suffering of alienation from God The fundatmentalists opponents share many of the same conservative values about family life On the whole they are opposed to abortion except in cases of rape and incest concerned about divorce worried about education Although called moderates by the secular press and liberals by fundamentalists many resent such labels and consider themselves to be conservatives especially when compared with mainstream culture But stressing the separation of church and state they deplore inerrantist attempts to put prayer back into public schools Wary of doctrine that insists on absolutes these Baptists believe in the authority of the Bible while allowing for latitude in individual interpretation The fundamentalist theologian Paige Patterson on the other hand argues that a conservative social philosophy is inextricably woven into the Bible which he says assigns fixed roles to women excluding them from acting as pastors or from teaching men But Pastor Gaston of Willow Meadows Baptist believes that such passages were written for a specific place and time and that a more universal message of the Bible should prevail That would make Gaston in Pattersons eyes a liberal Fundamentalists say that such liberalism if allowed to continue its drift will destroy the growth of the Southern Baptist Convention the largest Protestant denomination in the United States To stop this drift Patterson organized along with Paul Pressler a Houston judge a movement that has elected the presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention since 1979 and passed the resolution that offended Gaston Gaston 42 is typical of many Baptists who are determined to retake the convention from the inerrantists He has preached sermons and has been organizing other pastors and lay people for the next convention which begins Tuesday in Dallas The Southern Baptists convocation usually attract 15000 to 20000 messengers as they are called Messengers are supposed to reflect their particular churchs position they are supposed to vote their individual consciences Messengers can come from as many as 36000 churches in 50 states with a membership of more than 14 million people This year the roll of messengers may swell to 30000 because all over the country but especially in the traditional South ministers and lay people are preparing for a showdown between the fundamentalists and the more moderate factions for control of the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention It will be settled by a vote on Tuesday With control of the presidency comes indirect control of the appointments to the boards governing an annual budget of 130 million as well as six seminaries and 7000 missionaries at home and abroad The fundamentalist candidate will be Charles Stanley a popular pastor and television preacher from Atlanta who will be renominated for a customary second term Texas moderates have persuaded Winfred Moore pastor of Amarillos First Baptist Church and president of the Texas convention to run against Stanley Moores position is that the squabbling among Baptists has distracted them from their evangelical purpose For Paige Patterson the argument over the essential truth of the Bible is one of the three greatest religious issues of Christian history comparable to the formation of the early church and the Reformation To many of Pattersons Southern Baptist critics inerrancy has become a loyalty test for conservative churches Much is at stake in the dispute Of the Southern Baptist Conventions 130million budget roughly onefifth comes from Texas churches One of the most successful of them has been Sagemont Baptist in southeast Houston under its pastor John Morgan Pastor Morgan 44 is a graduate of the same seminary as George Gaston Southwestern of Fort Worth but he holds a completely different view of the conflict A LITTLE OVER A MONTH ago Morgan told his congregation This controversy is not around politics Its around one thing free thinking Morgan paraphrased his opponents beliefs Ill teach what I want to Ill think what I want to I believe in the priesthood of the believer and dont you dare tell me what I am to think or do Folks thats the very thing your kids are thinking thats the very thing the homosexuals are thinking thats the very thing the people of this world are thinking I do my own thing and dont you bother me with any authority Morgan then attacked Baptist teaching and biblical interpretation at Southern Seminary in Louisville He pointed to a 1977 survey of Southern seminarians  widely circulated by fundamentalists  that purported to show that education there causes young men to lose their faith in God and the miracles of the Virgin Birth and Resurrection A seminary spokesman claims the survey was misinterpreted Morgan also cited scriptural interpretations by Southerns president Dr Roy Honeycutt who will not vote for the reelection of the fundamentalist Charles Stanley For example Morgan scoffed at Honeycutts suggestion that when Moses saw the burning bush it may have been a number of things including an internal vision If God didnt want us to believe the details of the Bible why did he have the writers spend so much time writing them Morgan asked rhetorically Gods word is either authority and infallible or we have nothing to share with the world anyway nothing Morgans emphasis on authority appears to have served him well during the 19 years since he founded Sagemont Baptist Church on empty prairie Brick subdivisions have multiplied rapidly during that time and Sagemont draws members from a wide area including the workers of the industrial areas near the ship channel the engineers and technicians from NASA at Clear Lake and the once small towns of Friendswood and Pearland that are becoming suburbs of Houston Surveys show that members of his church are middle to uppermiddle class with an average household income of 38000 On a Sunday morning some of his congregation will be dressed in threepiece suits and some will be dressed in freshly washed blue jeans and polished cowboy boots Blacks are involved in the church in small but growing numbers Southern Baptists have been leading the nation in the evangelizing of minority communities Sagemonts ministry for single adults led by Mike Davenport welcomes all to this fundamentalist church in a nonjudgmental manner In contemporary church life single adults is largely a euphemism for divorced Such people were not always welcomed by Southern Baptists among other churches says Davenport Their main problem is guilt and a poor selfimage Davenport reminds them of the woman at the well who had been divorced five times and lived with a man yet Jesus used her to spread his word Behind a desk whose face is decorated by a taxidermic desert scene of a blue quail beside a coiled rattlesnake John Morgan talks with frontier pride of the growth of his church More than 10000 people he says have joined Sagemont either by baptism or by transferring from another church Sagemont has 8 million worth of buildings all paid for he says A fleet of 22 white schoolbuses runs in a 10mile radius picking up children whose parents dont go to church The average Sunday collection gift is 19 a person He recalls the day he saw 1700 people put 800000 in a galvanized washtub to complete a building fund Morgan speaks of these numbers with the pride of a business executive in his sermon on the Southern Baptist controversy he called himself the CEO the chief executive officer of Sagemont Baptist Church But one number stands out above all Morgan says when the subject turns to liberals  as Morgan and many fundamentalists call their opponents That is the number of baptisms the number of souls brought to Christ In the year ending October 1984 Sagemont baptized 568 people second in Texas only to the largest and probably most famous Southern Baptist church in the United States Pastor WA Criswells First Baptist Church of Dallas From behind his desk Morgan pulls down a copy of the 1984 Southern Baptist annual onto his desk and looks up Pastor George Gastons moderate Willow Meadows Baptist Church Willow Meadows has been written about recently in a Houston newspaper because its congregation vowed to increase its giving to the Southern Baptist Convention after a fundamentalist preacher had said that some fundamentalist churches might withhold funds if their candidate were defeated The Willow Meadows resolution called on Southern Baptists to recommit themselves to a life style devoid of threat and manipulative political activity How many souls had been baptized at Willow Meadows In 19831984 it was 23  the consequence Morgan declared of preaching a liberal interpretation of the Bible THE ORIGIN OF BAPTISTS AS freedomloving liberals has long been overshadowed by their reputation as pious moralists who disapprove of dancing card playing makeup and alcohol The early Baptists of 17thcentury Europe revolted against ecclesiastical authority embodied in the baptism of infants Baptists believe that a person can be saved and baptized only when he personally knows God at an age of reason  7 8 and 9 are common Baptists insisted on a higher authority than that of priests or kings and on the individuals right freely to read interpret preach and publish interpretations of Scripture Today members of the congregation often take notes during sermons underline their Bibles and check crossreferences Listening to sermons is not enough Involved Baptists study Scripture in Sunday school and learn how to evangelize their friends and neighbors Such beliefs inevitably led Baptists into conflict with censorship and opposition to taxation to support the established state church Such stands made the first Baptists political and religious liberals not conservatives Transplanted to America Baptists in Virginia were imprisoned for preaching on street corners without first securing a license Working with Episcopalian James Madison Virginia Baptists petitioned George Washington for the First Amendment guaranteeing not only freedom of religion but separation of church and state and freedom of the press speech and the right of assembly In recent years the efforts of some fundamentalists to pass a schoolprayer amendment or laws that give tuition tax credits to religious schools have been opposed by Baptists who believe this violates the First Amendment Southern Baptists split off from their northern brethren in 1845 over slavery While the less evangelical northern Baptists have not grown as rapidly in number Southern Baptists have almost tripled from 59 million in 1945 to 143 million today Southern Baptists find themselves arguing about whether that growth is the result of belief in authority or a tradition of individual freedom P ASTOR GASTON MAKES NO apologies about the number of baptisms at Willow Meadows He came four years ago from a teaching job in Southwestern Seminary to help revitalize the congregation In the late 1950s and early 1960s Willow Meadows was a growing neighborhood like Sagemont Gaston says Now the average age of his congregation is 50 to 55 and many members are living on a fixed income With 3000 members it is still one of the 10 largest churches in Houston with a Sunday Biblestudy class averaging 700 in attendance Gaston questions the emphasis on numbers but his is a theology of conversion and he wants to do better A planning committee within Willow Meadows is studying how the congregation can stimulate conversion by creating new churches Gaston wonders too about the quest for authority My members are a smart group of people I want their input I dont have the final word This congregation has the final word People are looking for answers in a world where there appear to be no answers I want to teach them how to have faith in the midst of that world I can agree that Christ is the answer but I cant say that everything is black and white To Gaston the fundamentalists are constricting the horizons of Southern Baptists For example he contends that Bold Mission Thrust an attempt to communicate the Gospel to every person in the world by the year 2000 has been diluted since inerrantists took over the presidency In opposing the reelection of the fundamentalist Charles Stanley Gaston is in company with many of those who work for Baptist agencies and seminaries In April the head of the Baptist Foreign Mission Board R Keith Parks said that by threatening to withhold gifts to the cooperative program fundamentalists are holding missionaries hostage to the conflict within the Southern Baptist Convention Gastons former boss Dr Russell Dilday president of Southwestern Seminary in Fort Worth the worlds largest has been meeting with pastors and lay people across the country speaking of efforts by the fundamentalists to tape conversations secretly and keep files on those seminarians considered to be liberals He calls their efforts a new form of McCarthyism Because both sides insist that they represent mainstream Baptist belief the final arbiters will be the laity John F Baugh a successful businessman who has served on many Southern Baptist boards has recently helped start a journal to express his concern about the massive egos on both sides Surveys show that 80 percent of the messengers at past conventions were pastors seminary professors students Baptist agency officials or their wives The percentage of lay people who attend this years convention will probably increase because of the conflict Baugh vows that half of the 1986 convention will be laity Though Baugh refuses to use labels or name names it is clear that his sentiments are with the moderate leaders such as Dilday Honeycutt and Parks O NE OF WILLOW Meadowss 10 messengers this year will be a layman Rodney Wolf Wolf 36 sells electrical equipment He lives in a modest brick home in southwest Houston with his wife Nancy and his sons Rex 10 and Ryan 4 and daughter Rebecca 7 He grew up attending Texas Avenue Baptist Church in a poorer section of Houston He was active in the Baptist Student Union in college He met his wife at Glorietta a Baptist encampment in the New Mexico mountains He teaches Sunday school Nancy is a middleschool math teacher worried about the teaching of secular humanism in the schools They monitor their childrens activities carefully By choice Rex goes to sleep listening to a preacher at night on the radio Of the Bible Wolf says he thinks of it as the story of how God relates to men It wasnt written as a science book It wasnt written as a history book If the Bible misses a date or a chronology is wrong it doesnt affect me Wolf believes that evolution should be taught as a theory not as a fact He says he was not too fond of the ordination of women but that he has changed The pastor asked me and I said Im still coming and were still giving If I didnt like it I could go find a church dead set against it Nancy Wolf points out that there were plenty of women in the Bible who had important roles in the building of the church When her husband was elected deacon she says she baked the casseroles and brought them to the sick I might as well have been elected deacon she says I did half the work Although Rodney Wolf has grown up a Baptist he has never been to a convention or even thought about it until last fall He became concerned that his denominations time and money were being wasted on controversy instead of being spent on evangelism Weve always been a diverse bunch Wolf says of the Baptists The only thing holding us together is sending out missionaries If there are some bad seminary professors they need to be dealt with And Wolf recalls something he says George Gaston once said Theres nothing more awesome than falling in the hands of a loving God unless its falling in the hands of a Christian who says You will believe as I believe  B OTH SIDES CLAIM TO distrust centralized authority In carefully couched terms the fundamentalist Paige Patterson writes in one of his pamphlets about the modern supercorporate convention Churches that do not buy teaching materials from the Sunday school board he asserts face the probability of pressure and even harassment Moderates in turn accuse the fundamentalists of creedalism an attempt to enforce conformity among Baptists There can be no doubt that the moderates especially those on the Southern Baptist Conventions staff are worried For the last five elections they have been disorganized The conservatives have united behind a single candidate while the moderate vote was divided This year each side will field a distinct candidate and while the candidates are trying to stay above the fray their supporters are pulling all the stops It is difficult to tell whether the Baptists are heading for an irrevocable split such as happened several years ago in the Lutheran Church of the Missouri Synod The Southern Baptists most famous evangelist Billy Graham who is staying aloof from the conflict has said the Devil is at work in the divisiveness of the denomination and that he prayed for a revival of spirit that would bring fundamentalists and moderates together again Many Baptists hope for a special committee to be appointed by the 1985 convocation to resolve their differences In an effort to bring the two sides together the presidents of seven state Southern Baptist Conventions met in Memphis recently to appoint a special committee to try to resolve the conflict T HE BESTKNOWN Southern Baptist pastor is WA Criswell of First Baptist Church of Dallas It was Criswell who closed the Republican convention in prayer last summer Billy Graham belongs to his church Criswell has been preaching an inerrantist interpretation of Scripture for 50 years and since 1944 has made the First Baptist with 26000 members the biggest in the Southern Baptist Convention He has helped raise money for the Criswell Center for Biblical Studies an alternative seminary for preparation for the Baptist ministry run by Paige Patterson Criswell is known for his immaculate dress his propensity for reading the New Testament in Greek and his uncanny shrewdness in building his churchs downtown real estate to the value of 200 million In the waiting room of his office a Bible sits next to a book whose spine reads How Archeology Disproves the Bible by A Digger The pages of the book of course are blank Criswell says that the biggest change he has seen in his lifetime is the growth and influence of the electronic media They have changed society and changed the ministry The idea of a church when I came 40 years ago he said was a cracker box with stained glass windows and George Truett  his predecessor  preaching The church now is an island in a vast unChristian world he said It must minister to all of the needs of people from fitness and health to psychological counseling and social activities The church is a thousand times different from what it was The preaching of the Gospel is just one facet of many many facets His own preaching has changed He seldom preaches of the fire and brimstone that threaten the unbeliever he says Perhaps he should more he reflects He has seen more divorce than he could ever imagine when he was growing up in a small west Texas town His own daughter has been divorced twice The New Testament is explicit about divorce he says The grounds for divorce are adultery But he recalls a magazine article he read once in an airplane whose message was about other kinds of infidelity than sexual The writer had a good point Criswell said Maybe it is possible to be spiritually unfaithful Here is a man who beats up his wife and is a terror to his children and doesnt go out to a whorehouse You cant help but be sympathetic But nothing has changed in his attitude toward the liberal drift of the Southern Baptist Convention He talks of the great Baptist institutions that have been lost to liberalism such as Brown University in Providence RI and the University of Chicago They werent all lost in a second Criswell said They gradually turned to a liberal interpretation of the Bible and that can happen here in the South    This is an attempt to stay to abate that direction To help insure the reelection of Charles Stanley Criswell recently sent 35000 letters to pastors an unusual action in Southern Baptist politics Criswell believes that Stanley will be reelected and that no major schism will occur The two sides will just gradually grow apart Its not going to be resolved he said Perhaps not While most Baptists appear to agree about such basic doctrinal issues as the Virgin Birth of Christ His death and Resurrection and atonement for our sins and the certainty of His return something more important seems to be going on Belief in inerrancy has nothing to do with salvation says Paige Patterson Salvation is strictly a matter of repentance and of faith in Jesus Christ Its just that a loss of belief in the Bible will lead to a loss of the rest of belief says Patterson Like much of the rest of a society that is reexamining its values fundamentalists are fearful of losing a central core of belief and authority They see their role not so much as changing something but preventing something from happening And that is a very hard principle to compromise
GOODBYE TO JOE BOB AND ALL THAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/09/weekinreview/goodbye-to-joe-bob-and-all-that.html,For 30 years Yankee writers have come down to Texas looked around at its glittery oilboom cities and pronounced that roughandtumble Texas was becoming more like the rest of the United States  a rising tide of accountants and lately wine bars and croissants It was enough to make any real Texan tug on his silver buckle climb into his pickup and head off to the ranch at 85 miles an hour But now Texas with its outsize mystique and jealously guarded history may really be changing And the force is not the energy boom that in the last decade brought huge inmigration from other parts of the country but its collapse Recognizing that the state economy is too heavily based on oil and gas production Texas is reaching out mightily to diversify into high technology education and the scientific research and service industries all worthy enterprises but ones to which Texas brings no special advantage other than its raging entrepreneurial spirit To attract such industry the states leadership has decided Texas must improve its schools upgrade cultural life and smooth out the rough edges that for so long have defined its spirit It could be argued as some Texans will still put it that the rest of the country is becoming more like Texas After all the folks down here promoted the strange idea that Ronald Reagan should be President and that free enterprise should be unleashed Americans have long been fascinated with the Texas myth Would anyone ask if Ohio is becoming more American Texas is so quintessentially American it is almost foreign In his 1961 classic The SuperAmericans John Bainbridge wrote Texas is a mirror image in which Americans see themselves reflected not lifesized but as in a distorting mirror bigger than life They are not pleased by the image Many Texans say the image was always movie and ad agency exaggeration that Texas was never quite that different Whatever the case there is today good evidence that Texas now the third largest state after California and New York is losing its distinctiveness The superficial indicators remain it has more pickup trucks than any other state 3 million and people are 30 percent more likely to be murdered in Texas than New York but Texas is now mostly urban and suburban More than half the population lives in or near the six largest cities and only 37 percent works in agricultural jobs The national average is 32 percent Of Texass nonagricultural workers one of five earns a living in a service occupation That is about the same as the national average Texas has more manufacturing jobs than Michigan and ranks third after New York and California in foreign trade The defunct oil boom has left the state looking more average in unemployment too Last year unemployment in Texas was 59 percent 37th best among the states and the District of Columbia Not long ago Texas was 5th The new personality found a resounding echo in the Texas legislative session that ended last week The lawmakers repealed the blue law passed an indigent health care plan voted to require seat belts and to raise state financing for the arts by 76 percent The days of Joe Bob and Bubba are gone said George C Shipley a Democratic polltaker here referring to Texass symbolic good ole boys Still the old Texas could not be entirely repressed The legislature passed a law forbidding cities to enact guncontrol laws After all pointed out Representative Mark Stiles a Democrat from Beaumont You get born you go die and while youre here you can have a gun if you want to The lawmakers also refused to alter that other cherished right to drink while driving so long as you dont get drunk The Struggle Ahead But the enormous influx of outlanders promises to change things more Many are young professional people moving from other states to Dallas Forth Worth Houston Austin and San Antonio Increasingly they are electing Republicans to represent them in Washington and Austin Indeed when he ran for reelection in 1982 Lieut Gov William P Hobby Democratic scion of an old Texas family was astonished to find that only about a third of Texans recognized his name even though he had been Lieutenant Governor for a decade Its a whole new state he said last week On his desk he displays a pair of silver spurs But behind him were two more potent symbols of the new Texas a computer terminal and a racquetball racquet The inevitable rise of the new Texan is bound to alter the collective thinking of our people writes David B Hill director of the Texas Poll a quarterly survey taken by Texas A  M University In a recent poll he found that 19 percent of adults had moved to the state since 1974 The newcomers he found were younger than natives and fiscally conservative but more liberal than most Texans on such social issues as abortion minority rights homosexuality atheism and family matters As more people stream into the state Mr Hill argues and as the percentage of native Texans shrinks we can expect these differences of opinion to serve as the foundation for a new and intense struggle for control of the state and its public policies Not all are persuaded such change is inevitable Most Yankees who stick in Texas dont come here to civilize us but to make a buck wrote TR Fehrenbach the Texas historian in a recent essay in the Dallas Times Herald Anyway he went on most of the migrants are from nearby states and they cant tell real French food from chickenfried steak any more than Texans can Already certain Texas chauvinisms are dying Texans are revising their own mythology he nonetheless acknowledges in Lone Star his history of Texas When they have lost it altogether and when the officeworking cardriving Texan is completely indistinguishable from his Northern counterpart the history of Texas as Texas will be done

REAGAN LETTER PRESSES LATIN REBEL AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/12/world/reagan-letter-presses-latin-rebel-aid.html,President Reagan pressed his campaign for renewed aid to the Nicaraguan rebels today by promising to consider resuming direct talks with the Government in Managua The Presidents promise made in a letter to Representative Dave McCurdy an Oklahoma Democrat appeared to be aimed at alleviating the fears of wavering lawmakers that his Administration sought the overthrow of the Nicraraguan Government The letter was written as the House of Representatives prepared to vote Wednesday on a proposal backed by the White House that would provide 27 million in nonmilitary aid to the rebels over the next nine months My Administration is determined to pursue political not military solutions in Central America the President wrote to Mr McCurdy the cosponsor of the aid package Response by Opponent Representative Richard A Gephardt a Missouri Democrat issued a statement saying that the aid package would jeopardize prospects for peace in Nicaragua and cause the United States to bog down in a Central American quagmire Mr Gephardt author of an amendment that would delay any aid to the rebels for another six months noted that the Administration wanted to increase the rebel force The conclusion is inescapable he said The Administration is not seeking peace but preparing for war Meanwhile the Senate continued debate on a bill outlining programs for the State Department Last week the Senate attached an amendment to that bill that would give 38 million in nonmilitary aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents over the next 16 months In a separate action today the Senate voted 63 to 34 to repeal a law barring any aid to rebels fighting the Marxist Government of Angola That prohibition originally adopted in 1975 is called the Clark amendment after its original sponsor former Senator Dick Clark of Iowa Other Rebel Aid Noted Senator Steven D Symms the Idaho Republican who sponsored the repeal noted that the United States was aiding armed rebellion against Marxist governments in Afghanistan Cambodia and Nicaragua Aides suggested that the issue would be dropped in conference with the House The Senate also rejected an amendment that would have given Mr Reagan a free hand to withhold population planning funds from groups that endorse abortion The amendment by Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina was defeated 53 to 45 The Senate then adopted the entire State Department bill including the aid to the insurgents by 80 to 17 The House rejected both military and nonmilitary aid to the Nicaraguan rebels in April but one key proposal lost by only two votes and the climate is now considered more favorable to the Administration In his threepage letter to Mr McCurdy President Reagan acknowledged that many Congressmen would like to see the talks between Washington and Managua resume Accordingly the President said he intends to open discussions with other Central American countries on how and when the US could resume useful direct talks with Nicaragua Intentions Are Qualified But he qualified his intentions by placing a higher priority on talks between the Sandinista Government and the rebels In his letter Mr Reagan came out strongly against two amendments that will be offered on Wednesday to alter the aid package One proposed by Mr Gephardt would postpone any aid to the rebels for six months while four nations Colombia Mexico Panama and Venezuela lead attempts at peace talks in Central America Mr Reagan said the Gephardt amendment would send a signal of irresolution to friends and adversaries The other amendment proposed by Representative Edward P Boland a Massachusetts Democrat would continue a law that now bars the Central Intelligence Agency the Department of Defense and other intelligencegathering departments from aiding directly or indirectly military operations against the Sandinistas

TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY: SOLUTIONS ELUSIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/us/teen-age-pregnancy-solutions-elusive.html,Although each year more than a million American adolescents become pregnant parenthood among unwed teenagers was not a burning national concern until a few years ago It is now There have been three sets of hearings on the subject before Congressional committees this year Members of one committee are drafting a proposal on how to handle the problem on the basis of a visit to the St Paul Maternal and Infant Care Project which reports a sharp reduction in the pregnancy rate among its teenaged clients Legislators are circulating several other proposals More foundations are giving money to Planned Parenthood of New York than ever before Conferences to consider pregnancy among teenagers abound The Alan Guttmacher Institute published findings in March that the United States was the only developed country where teenage pregnancy was on the rise More than a million American adolescents now become pregnant each year a high figure that has stirred new anxieties But the problem has only recently become a national cause for worry and one consequence of years of inattention is a lack of reliable data on what does and what does not help prevent adolescent pregnancy according to researchers They said an exception was a recent experimental program Project Redirection It reported substantially reducing in one year the rate of pregnancy among 305 unmarried teenagers from poor families The girls and young women from New York Boston Phoenix and Riverside Calif were given wideranging assistance that included access to contraceptives counseling in school and job support The Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation which supervised the experiment also reported the disheartening information that a year after the programs end almost half the participants became pregnant and 40 percent were neither in school nor employed The sponsors concluded the program was too short contraceptives had not been sufficiently stressed and older teenagers needed more job training Possibility of Results Hailed Still the results were welcomed by many sociologists as demonstrating that such a program could have an impact Project Redirection financed at the end of the 1970s by the Department of Labor under the Carter Administration and by the Ford Foundation is being tried at least in part in other cities But experts in the field pointed out that the experiment focused on adolescents who were already mothers or pregnant not on preventing a first pregnancy The project was politically safe said Prof Frank Furstenberg a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania because almost everyone agrees that young mothers need help should be encouraged to stay in school get job training and avoid second pregnancies But preventing the first pregnancy is more complex he argued because it implicitly accepts that adolescents are sexually active and opens up debate about sex education access to contraceptives and abortion These issues collide with the policies of the Reagan Administration and some legislators views The Administration has advocated sexual abstinence Under the 1981 Adolescent Family Life Program derided by critics as a chastity law it has channeled funds to 71 projects around the country that emphasize to teenagers they have an option not to have sexual relations and that stress parental involvement She Says Its Too New Jo Ann Gasper who directs the Office of Population Affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services when pressed at Congressional hearings into a March report on the Administrations program said the program had been in effect for two years or less and the results had not been evaluated Congress authorized 30 million for the program and has so far appropriated 147 million There are some indications of beneficial effects but these are very preliminary and we prefer to be cautious said Jerry Bennett deputy director of the Office of Population Affairs The Guttmacher report has already provoked some members of Congress to look more keenly at teenage pregnancy questions according to Karen Pittman of the Childrens Defense Fund The report showed that the lowest rates of teenage pregnancy and abortion were in other developed countries that had liberal attitudes toward sex where contraceptives were easily obtained by teenagers and where there were effective sex education programs The clinics in St Paul that attracted the attention of the Select Committee on Children Youth and Families offered comprehensive health services yearly to 3300 teenagers in four high schools The success of the undertaking stemmed largely from the location of the clinics within the schools which are the teenagers community said Ann Ricketts the administrator She said the birthrate declined from 59 per 1000 in 1976 to 26 per thousand in 1983 and that the trend was continuing down Representative George Miller a California Democrat who heads the committee is circulating a proposal calling for inschool clinics that would provide health services employment counseling education in being a parent and child care to enable adolescent parents to complete school The proposal would leave providing contraceptives to local communities Professor Furstenberg says that problem is the United States reluctance to accept that sexual activity and marriage are no longer tied together Administation View Assailed The Administration would like the problem of teenage pregancy to go away he said recently First it took an ostrichlike position Now it is trying to wish back the situation According to Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America the approach taken by Project Redirection was similiar to projects initiated 15 years ago I ran a program like that in Dayton Ohio and it was considered revolutionary and here we are she said She said that adolescent pregnancy should be dealt with like any epidemic Mrs Wattleton among other critics of the Governments policies has accused the Administration of attempting for five years to eliminate the only family planning program that focuses directly on providing services including contraception to women and teenagers in poverty Continuation of the program Title X of the Public Health Service Act was reauthorized last month by a Congressional committee with bipartisan support An appropriation of 1425 million slightly more than in 1984 is expected A move to require parental consent for adolescents to receive contraceptives was rejected Mr Bennett denies the Administration tried to eliminate Title X saying it advocated instead that these funds be included in a new block grant covering many health services which would have left administrating to the states According to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association a nonprofit association representing the 4000 clinics receiving Federal money 1000 clinics closed after Federal financing was cut 13 percent in 1981 We no longer say services are available wherever needed said Scott Swirling the executive director
A CRITIQUE ON PBS OF VIETNAM SERIES SETS OFF A DISPUTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/movies/a-critique-on-pbs-of-vietnam-series-sets-off-a-dispute.html,A Public Broadcasting Service program that will offer a conservative group an unusual chance to criticize the networks prizewinning series on Vietnam has touched off a dispute over whether PBS has given in to pressure from the Reagan Administration The twohour program which will be available to PBS stations beginning June 26 will include a 57minute film prepared by Accuracy in Media the conservative organization It will be shown on WNETChannel 13 in New York on June 27 as part of that stations Intercom series of firstperson documentaries Accuracy in Media which terms itself a media watchdog group is headed by Reed Irvine who strongly supported Gen William C Westmoreland in his libel suit against CBS and views PBS as a network with a long history of putting on leftwing programs Among the members of its advisory board are Clare Boothe Luce Edward Teller and William E Simon the former Treasury Secretary The group contends that the 1983 PBS series on Vietnam contained serious errors and distortions denigrating the role of American soldiers and underestimating the Communist nature of their opponents Charlton Heston who narrated the Accuracy in Media film Televisions Vietnam The Real Story contends that Americas purpose in Vietnam was noble but that it was misled by disinformation from the press and television which helped lose the war The PBS program will also include interviews with some of the producers of the original Vietnam series Vietnam A Television History in which they are asked to answer these charges as well as a panel discussion moderated by Arthur Miller the Harvard Law School professor PBS officials insist that their decision to air the Accuracy in Media documentary was made without pressure from the White House We had been interested for a long time in finding a way to do letters to the editor on television said Barry Chase the vice president for news and public affairs at PBS in Washington It wasnt so much that we picked the AIM program but that it picked us he explained In public television we just dont have the resources to show responses from all points of view Mr Chase said and when Accuracy in Media came along with a film already prepared it offered an interesting opportunity for PBS to present viewer response But Richard Ellison the executive producer of the original Vietnam series on PBS which was made at WGBH in Boston expressed skepticism of Mr Chases explanation Cites Indications of Pressure I cant prove it but I suspect there was political pressure from the Administration Mr Ellison said There is a strong rightwing climate in the country and these people may have been susceptible He pointed to what he contended were two indications of pressure One was that the Accuracy in Media film was partly financed by a special 30000 grant from William Bennett then chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities Mr Bennett who has since been appointed Secretary of Education by President Reagan has said he made the award out of an emergency fund he controlled without going through the endowments council The endowment before Mr Bennetts term had provided 12 million for the 13hour PBS series on Vietnam its largest source of funds Mr Ellison also pointed out that last December while PBS officials in Washington were debating whether to show the Accuracy in Media film Bruce Christensen the president of PBS received an invitation on White House stationery to attend a briefing and special showing of the program Mr Christensen declined the invitation which was sent out by Faith Whittlesey assistant to the President for public liason A White House official said the screening was one of several it has done for films that underscore Mr Reagans policies Others were The Silent Scream an antiabortion documentary and a forthcoming movie on the Miskito Indians fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua Chilling Effect Foreseen I think this is a very serious matter said Mr Ellison It is going to have a chilling effect on what public television does Mr Ellison is now working on a 10hour series on the Soviet Union for WGBH in Boston in conjunction with the Harriman Institute at Columbia University and he is concerned about possible interference by rightwing groups Mr Ellison at first refused to participate in the other hour of the twohour June 26 program Vietnam OpEd An Inside Story But he later changed his mind and agreed to be interviewed after realizing he said that PBS has given the AIM film respectability by putting it on the air and I couldnt just let it go unanswered But Stanley Karnow who wrote the script for the Vietnam series as well as the bestselling book that accompanied it Vietnam A History has refused to appear This is a free country Mr Karnow said and Reed Irvine the head of Accuracy in Media can do whatever he wants But the question is why is PBS putting on an extremely onesided view Mr Karnow continued Theres plenty of room for debate about Vietnam so why pick a rightwing lobby group instead of a panel of historians to discuss the series Its a dangerous precedent he asserted Is PBS going to let AIM or any other group respond whenever they have a complaint Called Important Experiment To insure journalistic balance and rebut criticisms by Mr Karnow and Mr Ellison Ned Schnurman the producer of the overall twohour PBS program and the former producer of the PBS series Inside Story is planning a 20minute introduction to the Accuracy in Media film he is preparing He says he hopes that this in addition to the interviews and panel debate after the documentary will clear up the rumors that PBS caved in to political pressure But Mr Schnurman believes the program is an important experiment which can also clear up the feeling among many Americans that the media is unresponsive He wants to focus on three criticisms of the Vietnam series raised by the Accuracy in Media film that it made Ho Chi Minh out to be a Jeffersonian democrat rather than a hardened Communist that it suggested many American GIs were drug addicts or psychopaths and that it made the South Vietnamese all look like prostitutes cowards or black marketeers Among the participants in the panel discussion are to be Mr Irvine the head of Accuracy in Media Richard Salant the former president of CBS News Col Harry Summers an Army historian Huynh Sonh Thong who directs Yale Universitys Southeast Asian refugee project and Lawrence W Lichty a journalism professor at the University of Maryland who helped put together the archival film used in the Vietnam series Mr Lichty contends the Accuracy in Media program is a piece of propaganda and says it is hard to answer the films charges because most of them are matters of opinion not fact But critics of the Accuracy in Media film concede that Mr Heston lends the film credibility Otherwise much of it is what television producers call talking heads a series of interviews with historians former American diplomats in Vietnam Colonel Summers and a South Vietnamese professor Some of the points they raise may seem esoteric to viewers not steeped in Vietnamese history such as a debate over who was responsible for an antiFrench uprising in 1930 Interspersed with the interviews and Mr Hestons sonorous voice is some archival footage from Vietnam the most arresting of which includes shots of Jane Fonda on her muchpublicized trip to Hanoi in 1972 Looking like a young girl Miss Fonda is shown joking with North Vietnamese antiaircraft gunners who are scanning the sky for American planes Unlike the PBS series

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT;   MEESE'S LIKELY CHOICES: YOUNG AND CONSERVATIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/17/us/justice-department-meese-s-likely-choices-young-and-conservative.html,Many of the top jobs at the Justice Department have been vacant for months and speculation has been growing about what kind of team Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d wants But Mr Meese has been keeping his cards close to the vest Now however current and former Reagan Administration officials say that he has privately indicated his choices for most key positions and that those choices if confirmed would move the the department further to the right on the political spectrum than in the past Such a move would please conservatives who have contended that the Reagan Justice Department to date has not been ideologically bold enough And such a move would be in line with the earlier controversial choice of William Bradford Reynolds the head of the departments Civil Rights Division and the Administrations point man in attacks on busing and racial quotas as Associate Attorney General 4 Who Are Still in 30s Among the new appointees favored for key policy jobs by Mr Meese according to the officials are four lawyers still in their 30s who have already worked in the department winning praise from conservatives while infuriating some liberals They are Charles J Cooper deputy chief of the civil rights division whom Mr Meese is said to want to make head of the Office of Legal Counsel Carolyn B Kuhl deputy chief of the civil division who reportedly will move up to head the Civil Rights Division Richard K Willard acting chief of the civil division who is slated to head that division and Douglas H Ginsburg former deputy chief of the antitrust division and currently an aide to the Director of the Budget as head of the Antitrust Division Another conservative said to be tentatively chosen for a top Justice job is Herbert E Ellingwood an old friend of Mr Meeses According to the Administration sources he will head the Office of Legal Policy which screens candidiates for judgeships Its a brilliant shuffling of the deck said one to Administration official of the Meese choices Liberals disagree sharply of course And even some Administration allies have their doubts about the shuffle Mr Cooper 33 years old Miss Kuhl 32 Mr Willard 37 and Mr Ginsburg 39 are all younger and less experienced than most predecessors in the jobs for which they are said to be slated Several Republican former officials and Justice Department lawyers expressed dismay at the prospect of having the top ranks filled with people so young and so uniformly conservative in their political outlook You have to have some independent stature in those jobs and the ability to say no in the face of an awful lot of pressures one former official said They Are Praised by Others Whatever the case all have impressive academic records have logged several years in important Administration jobs and have won high praise from other political appointees who cite them for exceptional intelligence legal ability and hard work These are real stars said J Paul McGrath a former head of the Civil and Antitrust Divisions who supervised Miss Kuhl Mr Willard and Mr Ginsburg These are not the kind of people who are going to say yes to the boss just because thats what the boss wants to hear Under the leadership of William French Smith Mr Meeses predecessor the top level in the Justice Department was the most conservative in recent decades But conservative activists criticized some key Smith aides as insufficiently bold in attacking Supreme Court precedents and pressing President Reagans ideological agenda on issues such as civil rights school prayer and abortion Under Mr Meese some of these conservative activists are now confident there will be more boldness The department will make a more pointed intellectual attack on some of the doctrinal carryovers of the Warren Court and the Carter Administration Bruce Fein a legal expert who is politically conservative predicted Bob Jones Decision Cited Conversely liberals who thought things were bad under the Smith Justice Department say matters are getting worse Even more than in the past the Department of Justice is becoming the repository for rightwing ideologues said Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights One indication of the trend is what an official who left for private law practice a few months ago calls the meteoric rise of the Bob Jones team He referred to several officials who prevailed in a bitter internal dispute in late 1981 persuading Mr Smith to switch sides in a major Supreme Court case and argue that Bob Jones University in Greenville SC and other racially discriminatory private schools were legally entitled to tax exemptions Led by Mr Reynolds as the head of the Civil Rights Division the Bob Jones team included Mr Cooper a close Reynolds aide Miss Kuhl then a special assistant to Mr Smith and Mr Fein who has since left Their position touched off a storm of criticism in Congress and was decisively rebuffed by the Supreme Court Further the affair was regarded by some Smith aides as one of the Administrations worst blunders Those aides are now gone but much of the Jones team remains and its members seem headed for even bigger jobs

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE PRESSING BID TO BE MAYOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/nyregion/republican-candidate-pressing-bid-to-be-mayor.html,In a city that is almost unfailingly Democratic Diane McGrath the RepublicanConservative candidate for mayor seems unfailingly optimistic about her candidacy Im a new face she said of her candidacy her first try for elective office Im not another tired pol I see that as a positive step Mrs McGrath the first woman ever to be nominated for mayor by a major party in New York City was the fourth choice of Republican leaders with limited ability to raise campaign funds or troops I clearly do not believe that somehow Im being thrown to the wolves she said I do not believe that the county leaders are leading me down the primrose path Not a Long Walk A week after formally announcing her mayoral bid on the steps of City Hall Mrs McGrath a member of the State Crime Victims Board talked about her candidacy in her office at 270 Broadway across the street from City Hall We plan to move right over there its not a long walk and it shouldnt be much trouble moving furniture she said with a smile The frequent smiles and her relaxed manner belied the formidable political assignment she had just accepted  an assignment that culminated a journey that started in Plainville Kan population 3000 a small city that she left 20 years ago for New York Mrs McGrath who is 42 years old said she did not intend to leave her institutional creamcolored office with the usual political photographs and her 46300 annual salary from the state board although Governor Cuomo has a policy that candidates must leave state posts No Babe in the Woods Im not a Cuomo appointee she said Warren Anderson appointed me She was referring to the State Senate majority leader a Republican who recommends to the governor at least one member of the bipartisan fivemember board Despite not having run for office before Mrs McGrath who said that a grandmother was a Cherokee Indian is no babe in the woods as she put it She and her husband John a Manhattan lawyer have been active in many Republican campaigns in the state Mrs McGrath was appointed to her state post because of her efforts in Senator Andersons brief fling at running for governor in 1978 the year she joined the board Before she was named to the board she founded and operated an insurance agency When asked whether she considered herself a feminist Mrs McGrath said Is there such a thing as a quasi feminist I think I deserve a black belt in ladder climbing and hard work It hasnt been handed to me I worked for it the oldfashioned way It Was About Time She said that she favored an equal rights amendment and that she thought that partisan differences aside Geraldine A Ferraros Democratic Vice Presidential candidacy last year was wonderful for women It was about time Mrs McGrath said Asked about her view on the abortion issue she said Im prolife with major exceptions Mrs McGrath the mother of two teenagers is Protestant and her husband is Catholic She said she did not object to abortions in rape cases but opposed unrestricted abortions I do not believe that abortion should be used as a method of birth control she said Ideologically Mrs McGrath said she was a true moderate Republican She said she supported Ronald Reagan for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980 when many New York Republicans opposed him A Lot of Good Things I think hes a tremendous leader she said I think hes accomplished a lot of good things and a number of people are proud to be Americans again I dont see anybody hanging their head people are walking tall She said she had reservations about at least one feature of the Presidents tax program  the plan to eliminate Federal incometax deductions for state and local taxes a proposal that has been criticized by New York politicians from both major parties Im not so sure Im totally in favor of it she said At the very least Id like to see it phased in Mrs McGrath said that politicians like Ed Koch and other Democratic leaders are out of tune with America Reagan carried 49 states thats a mandate and its time to fall in line Noting that President Reagan has been called the Teflon man she said such criticism was more justified for the Teflon Mayor  nothing is his responsibility no one is accountable you really cant manage the city You cant do it with razzmatazz she added The Real World On issues likely to surface in the mayoral campaign Mrs McGrath said she absolutely supported the death penalty and favored including civilians on a police review board I have a problem she said if you have to call the police when you have a problem with the police Mrs McGrath said she opposed a separate public school for homosexual children on the ground that it would not prepare them for the real world She also said she preferred that police officers live in the city but would like to see statistics on how many would be affected She questioned why Mayor Koch was raising the residency issue now Hes had this for the last eight years she said and hes done nothing about it Mrs McGrath who lives on the East Side was first sounded out on the mayoral race by George L Clark Jr the Republican state chairman and a longtime friend She said she saw her candidacy as a means of bringing back Republicans who objected to the partys endorsement of Mr Koch four years ago Its new its innovative its refreshing she said If they want to come over this is the time to do it
HOLTZMAN ISSUES NEW RULES FOR ARRESTS MADE OFF DUTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/nyregion/holtzman-issues-new-rules-for-arrests-made-off-duty.html,District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn yesterday issued new guidelines to her staff for identifying and handling cases in which offduty police officers make arrests The guidelines stem from two recent cases in which offduty officers made arrests that Miss Holtzmans office later determined were not warranted Effective immediately members of the district attorneys staff will determine as soon as possible after an offduty officer makes an arrest whether abuse of authority occurred and whether there is sufficient independent evidence to confirm the officers account of the incident If there is a determination that the arrest was unwarranted the person arrested will be released and the district attorney will not prosecute Release and Medical Care Miss Holtzman said the guidelines were not intended to obstruct law enforcement but rather to insure that people arrested in such cases were released as rapidly as possible and that they received immediate medical attention if necessary These are designed to deal with situations where there is no lawenforcement purpose she said Offduty police can get in personal disputes except they have the power to make arrests and carry a 38caliber gun A spokesman for the Police Department Sgt Raymond ODonnell in response said We do not have any problems with general guidelines However it is in everyones interest that guidelines be developed mutually This department has some serious concerns about the guidelines developed by the Kings County District Attorney and we will be asking for an opportunity to sit down and clarify these concerns Abuse of Authority A spokesman for the Patrolmens Benevolent Association said the union president Philip R Caruso was in a meeting in Queens and could not be reached In one case referred to by Miss Holtzman the officer abused his authority to cover up his misconduct in a personal dispute she said The officer Perry Novello was indicted last month for assault and other charges stemming from an incident in which he reportedly carried his former girlfriend out of a Brooklyn restaurant and assualted two men who had tried to help her In the other case Miss Holtzman said the officer was trying to advance a purely personal objective The officer Russell Bjune an 11year member of the force was suspended last month and charged with assaulting a Brooklyn woman as she was leaving an abortion clinic with a friend Officer Bjune was picketing the clinic and had arrested the woman In both cases the charges against the people arrested were dropped by Miss Holtzmans office The guidelines will apply if the sole complainant is an offduty officer or his or her companion if the reported crime is against the officer or the companion and if the person arrested did not use a deadly weapon Miss Holtzman said the Police Department had been informed of the policy and would notify her office of any arrests by offduty officers that meet the criteria
EGYPTIAN AUTHOR DEFIES TRADITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/20/books/egyptian-author-defies-tradition.html,Laila AbouSaif sees the book on the shelves of bookstores and although the cover bears her picture and the pages her words she feels strangely detached from A Bridge Through Time her memoirs Under the title and a collage of photographs of her there is a name that is not hers Laila Said I called myself that to protect my family said Miss AbouSaif whose book published by Summit chronicles in painful and provocative detail her career as Egypts preeminent female stage director and her rift with the Arab tradition in which she was raised It is mostly in telling of her personal life  her resentment of a prearranged marriage an abortion which though illegal still required the approval of her father the love affairs she had as a married woman and her divorce  that Miss AbouSaif was afraid of causing a fedelha a scandal for her family So she said she chose a pseudonym that would shield them from at least some of the pain Defying Arab Traditions To an Arab family the revelation of such intimate accounts in so public a fashion is scandalous said Miss AbouSaif who teaches at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven but who still wants to return to teach and direct in Cairo By having someone elses name really no one elses name on the book I could protect them The society Laila AbouSaif was born into 44 years ago was not much more liberating for women than the world of her grandmother Om Abdou who in Arab tradition was identified as the mother of Abdou her oldest son But like her grandmother who won the right to manage her own property after the death of her second husband Miss AbouSaif defied the traditions that had constrained generations of Arab women At the age of 17 Miss AbouSaif postponed an arranged marriage so she could study theater in the United States In doing so she began a creative and controversial career that catapulted her to the forefront of Egyptian politics and culture Her stage film and television productions in the 1960s and early 70s satirized Egypts military regime and its economic policies and most importantly to Miss AbouSaif they cast in a stark and ugly light the discrimination against women in the Arab society Plays Eventually Censored Most of her plays were presented at a Cairo caravanserai a medieval Islamic trading center At first the Government graciously allocated the site to her but later as her plays became more profoundly political it censored her from working there In writing about her career Miss AbouSaif also recounts modern Egyptian history including the 1967 war with Israel the death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser the Yom Kippur War of 1973 the Camp David peace accords and the assassination of President Anwar elSadat She also tells how her life folded into and broke away from the traditions of a country she still obviously cherishes I dont want the book to be read as an indictment of my society said Miss AbouSaif who is so determined to work in Egypt again that she still carries a business card listing her address as Giza Cairo I left an entire life behind family friends colleagues Some of them understood my need to express myself in this book but others will be taken back by my honesty The decision to veil her identity like so many Arab women who conceal their faces behind drapes of cloth was painful said Miss AbouSaif She no more wants to hide her rich dramatic life than she would want to eclipse the fine high cheekbones that cradle her bright amber eyes Although she does not expect the book to be published in Egypt she knows some copies will be smuggled into the country and she will be recognized by those familiar with her despite the pseudonym But now I want my name back she said Please use my real name  AbouSaif Of Universal Problems The premise of her book said Miss AbouSaif is not feminism although in the years that she shuttled between Cairo and the United States she became close friends with feminists like Gloria Steinem Cessa Nabarawi one of the first Egyptian women to remove her veil and Hoda Chaarawi a cofounder of Egyptian feminism What she hopes to portray through the example of her life and her work said Miss AbouSaif is that the problems of being a woman are universal and that the condition of women around the world demands of women to be fighters But it is a man whom she credits with giving her the courage to dissent from Arab traditions to experiment with her work and to find a life that would suit her buoyant and probing spirit My father is the first person who ever told me that I had a choice said Miss AbouSaif who dedicated her memoirs to her father Nessim who gave me his spirit and whose life and death is described in the book in loving detail He was the person she said who when I wanted an abortion because I knew that I could not handle having a child either emotionally or professionally said to me You Laila must choose I chose and I continued to make choices including writing this book And now of course I wonder will I be heard Will I be understood
A Wrong Signal On Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/opinion/a-wrong-signal-on-birth-control.html,Fifteen years ago the United States was accused of espousing population control as a means of keeping developing countries weak and subjugated Ironically now that many have accepted the need to control population growth the United States may change its tune If antiabortion lobbyists are successful in Congress the United States will send the wrong signal to developing countries  that it is willing to sacrifice worldwide family planning efforts in order to influence population control programs in China Congress is considering several proposals that would prohibit United States funds to go to any country or organization supporting or participating in a program of coercive abortion or infanticide Fair enough Not even the staunchest proponents of family planning advocate spending money for such acts However antiabortion groups have used reported incidents of abuse in China as a pretext to end financing of all family planning programs Congress is considering a measure that would effectively block payment of a 10 million pledge to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities President Reagan should urge Congress to reject such legislation Curiously family planning programs are the surest antidotes to abortion and the legislation promoted by antiabortion lobbyists thus defeat precisely what they claim they want to prevent Though the aim of their outrage this time is abuses in China the measures they seek are the same as in past campaigns  the end of all family planning efforts Antiabortion groups have already been sucessful in halting United States aid to the International Planned Parenthood Federation The latest measures are superfluous moreover because existing law already bars the use of United States funds for abortions So money is hardly the issue here Pointing a finger at China and trying to impose our own domestic political considerations or cultural norms on other countries only strains relations Blocking the United States contribution to the United Nations fund will not affect Chinas policies but it will seriously damage one of the better and more deserving programs We should be among the first to encourage not penalize it China is one of some 140 countries in which the United Nations Fund for Population Activities now operates and which will be penalized as well The 10 million the fund stands to lose this year is only part of the total United States contribution to the fund which is about 25 percent of the approximately 150 million budget The more important question therefore has to do with future years The Chinese are understandably annoyed by the fuss saying it has been stirred up by old and inaccurate reports Nonetheless they have gone out of their way to assure us that they will not use money from the fund for abortions The funds executive director Rafael M Salas has also given his word to the State Department that his organization does not and will not take part in abortion activities in China or anywhere else The world population growth rate showed a small decline for the first time in 1984 but it is projected to soar to six billion by the end of the century More than 90 percent of this growth is expected in developing countries World population experts estimate that population may stabilize by the year 2090 but only with the help of a sustained family planning effort The tragedy sweeping Africa today is a tragic lesson The drought was only the trigger one of the key underlying causes was an uncontrolled population growth and the resultant pressure it has placed on the naturalresource base of an already fragile land The United States has committed itself to 1 billion in emergency Robert L Schiffer a former State Department and United Nations official writes on international affairs aid to Africa in 1985 Emergency help will not provide a cure unless the cause too is attacked What happened in Africa can happen again there and elsewhere The developing countries have come to recognize the danger that unchecked population growth poses We should not abandon them Domestic abortion politics ought not to be extended to foreign policy While the relatively few million dollars that are earmarked for family planning can hardly assure peace or stability its loss can put them in jeopardy
DIOCESE UPHELD OVER ABORTIONS AT TWO CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/nyregion/diocese-upheld-over-abortions-at-two-clinics.html,In a legal victory for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany the state was ordered by an appeals court today to reconsider its permission to let two Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortions The 3to1 decision by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court here determined that the State Health Department had used improper criteria in approving the clinics in Albany and in Hudson The court also affirmed that the diocese had the right to sue State officials said the decision on legal standing  in which the appellate court reversed a lowercourt ruling that the diocese could not be a party in the case  was particularly troubling This opens abortion decisionmaking to disinterested parties a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams Nathan Riley said It will cause a lot of headaches down the road There Is a Need Health Department officials and lawyers from Mr Abramss office are to meet Monday to decide whether to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals the states highest court or to reconsider the clinic applications under different criteria Were convinced that on substance were right said Peter Slocum a spokesman for Dr David Axelrod the Health Commissioner There is a need The court ruled that the department had depended too heavily on the 50 percent rule The rule says there is a need for new clinics when fewer than half the abortions in an area are performed outside hospitals Its intent is to provide cheaper more easily accessible abortions Bishop Howard J Hubbard of Albany brought the suit last Jan 11 against the clinics run by Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood Inc charging that the state had issued its approval using imprecise criteria It was thought to be the first legal challenge to abortion clinics on procedural grounds by the Catholic Church A Significant Victory The diocesan chancellor the Rev Michael A Farano called the ruling today a significant victory for the right of the public to have a voice in the delivery of healthcare services The executive director of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood Ruth S Klepper said Were disappointed that this continues to delay the care we want to provide The diocese won the procedural argument here in a ruling Jan 31 by Justice Harold J Hughes of State Supreme Court But Justice Hughes removed the diocese from the case leaving two women as individual plaintiffs He found that the Health Department had acted capriciously but that individuals not a corporate entity such as the diocese had the right to sue The ruling today upheld the lower court on the procedural question and overruled it on who had the right to sue All the initial petitioners had a federally created right to seek judicial review the court decided In dissent Justice Howard A Levine agreed with the majority that the church had legal standing but disagreed that the state had acted on improper grounds in approving the clinics He said a fair reading of the record showed that the Health Department had used a variety of criteria in deciding on its approval

first book Broken Earth which was published in 1983 was an account of peasant life in contemporary China based on ethnographic fieldwork in the Pearl River Delta near Canton in 197980 Mr Moshers critical observations about the Peoples Republic in particular about such measures as the use of forced abortions in rural areas have made him a controversial figure in 1983 he was expelled from the anthropology department of Stanford University after an investigation into charges of unethical conduct while in China  charges that have not been made public  and when the university decided to reconsider the case last year it received a warning from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences that cultural exchanges with the United States might be endangered if the expulsion were reversed A final decision has not yet been announced In Journey to the Forbidden China we learn how Mr Mosher first incurred the displeasure of the Chinese authorities By the end of his stay in the relatively prosperous Pearl River Delta he was eager to see for himself what living conditions were like in less favored regions when he applied for permission to make a motor trip deep into southern China it was fairly readily granted and together with a local driver he set out in his van to explore a countryside that few outsiders ever see There were no problems until he reached the remote inland province of Guizhou but then he was detained and told that he was traveling through a restricted region It was in vain that he protested that he had a valid permit the local officials insisted on a signed confession  a problem he got round by asking if he could write it out in English and then setting down roughly the opposite of what was dictated in the most indigestible language he could think of After that he was put on a train and sent back to Canton Despite a sticky interview in the Public Security Office he was not deported and he assumed that the episode was closed But six months later when he had already left China he began to hear the first rumors that Chinese officials were accusing him of having been a spy Mr Mosher describes all this vividly but the real subject of his book is not so much the somewhat Kafkaesque circumstances under which his journey was cut short as the journey itself In a succession of sketches he portrays provincial  desperately provincial  towns primitive villages life on the road a dirt road most of the time encounters with ordinary Chinese citizens The result is a sharp and memorable travelogue very different from the usual collection of hackneyed verbal snapshots And while the whole trip lasted only a few days it raises fundamental questions about the nature and future of Chinese society under its present masters The strongest impressions that remain after reading the book  along with a sense of the patience and fortitude of the Chinese people  are of poverty inequality and stagnation Poverty indeed seems an inadequate word for many of the scenes Mr Mosher records  the upland villages where there were no dogs because there were not enough scraps to feed them and no pigs because there was not enough garbage for them to root in or the small children hanging around restaurants rushing in to scrape up the leftovers whenever they could peasant children sent off to town by their parents to fend for themselves and then beaten and driven away by the security cadres of a state that refused to take responsibility for them Within such a society the privileges enjoyed by the political elite stand out all the more blatantly  an expensive ribbon of paved road where there would normally have been a bumpy track turns out to lead to a gleaming Californiastyle holiday village for local officials But there is also a less acute but more pervasive inequality between town and country and within the countryside between peasants living near cities or in the fertile lowlands who thanks to Deng Xiaopings reforms now have at least a limited opportunity to peddle their goods in the free market and the majority who live under a system characterized by Mr Mosher as a kind of state feudalism Still China was an extremely poor country when the Communists took over Are things at any rate better than they were It is symptomatic that when Mr Mosher put this question to an unusually candid village official it was taken in a sense different from the one intended and his informant said yes things were certainly better than they had been during the Cultural Revolution when some years there was no grain at all and we were eating bitterness As for longterm progress the villagers still had no radios or bicycles or electricity And similar stories were repeated elsewhere In another village when a middleaged carter was asked how things had changed since the revolution he replied after a pause  Now we have rubber tires on our carts Worst of all was the enforced isolation Since 1958 it has been a crime in China to change your residence without official permission and if you were born a peasant you die a peasant This is a country  unlike most third world countries  where trains rush from town to town without stopping at villages If Chinese cities are kept free of slums it is at the cost of maintaining innumerable slums in the countryside  or so Mr Mosher contends  and the peasants who carried Mao to power remain tethered to their villages like so many serfs Mr Mosher doesnt judge Journey to the Forbidden China the right occasion for discussing alternative answers to what are admittedly very difficult problems But he strikes me as a thoroughly dependable witness and the book itself is an impressive and compelling piece of testimony

IS SEX NECESSARY? USEFUL? POSSIBLE? FUN?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/books/is-sex-necessary-useful-possible-fun.html,THE REDUNDANT MALE Is Sex Irrelevant in the Modern World By Jeremy Cherfas and John Gribbin 197 pp New York Pantheon Books Cloth 1595 Paper 795 MAKING BABIES The New Science and Ethics of Conception By Peter Singer and Deane Wells 245 pp New York Charles Scribners Sons 1495 ONCE upon a time junior anthropology professors could recite the famous rhyme and get away with it Hogamus higamus Men are polygamous Higamus hogamus Women monogamous They can recite it no longer The combination of reasonably reliable contraception controlled by women and their increased economic independence has fundamentally and probably forever altered a broad pattern of sociosexual life rooted in our evolutionary history For all the vast impact of what we have built around us more significant still is the effect of the industrialization of our bodies  of having gained control of our reproductive inner tissue as we have of our productive outer world And while the most visible and active expression of this has been feminism and the social changes with which it is associated there are other underlying family and reproductive patterns that are becoming discernible also to which The Redundant Male and Making Babies guide us in rather different but related ways Theoretically women now can be as polygamous as they like because adequate contraceptive methods are available Not only can they by and large select their mates on their own but they can also decide when and if they and these mates will be able to reproduce The impact of this goes well beyond fertility itself Sexuality is inextricably involved with the meanings and emotions of reproduction whether the participants want it to be or not it is not just a sport or a consumer good or a form of therapy or selfexpression Having the final say in this central matter provides women with a precise and powerful control they have never had For their part men may try to be as monogamous as they can but with drastically reduced confidence of enjoying what biologists now call paternity certainty that assurance Othello and countless others so passionately and destructively craved Ironically many feminists have tried to drum biological science out of their academy because of the anatomy is destiny controversy But modern biology appears to be discovering evidence for one important source of traditional male dominance which is that it arises in part from pervasive male uncertainty about the fatherhood of children and not only from the hectic machismo with which we are familiar Jeremy Cherfas and John Gribbin are English writers on science who combine a lively muscular style with a responsible and balanced perspective on what biology has to tell us about ourselves In The Redundant Male they confront directly the problem of explaining the enormous differences among cultures in the way men and women conduct their reproductive lives For example they report that in a survey of 849 contemporary and recent cultures only 137 were monogamous in 708 men could have multiple wives while only in 4 could women have more than one husband at a time And they cite a researcher who found that in 138 societies 99 have a signal that advertises whether a woman is married or not But only 4    have similiar signals for men In our own society practically all married women signal their status with a ring few men do so A man can easily tell whether a woman is married but a woman can be easily deceived They describe how males are more than three times as likely as females to die between the ages of 20 to 30 from accident suicide homicide and selfpoisoning usually with drugs andor alcohol The authors relate this to blundering reproductive selfadvertisement to males overkill effort to impress females with their energy and valor They link the sexual double standard to mens effort to enjoy both frequent opportunities to father offspring preferably without the cost and travail of rearing them while retaining some sense that the children they do help raise are their own By describing in rather fundamental terms how and why the natural human sexual system evolved and what its most general forms have been Mr Cherfas and Mr Gribbin set the stage for their evaluation of the impact of recent developments Have males become redundant Is the sexual ballet irrelevant to reproduction in the modern world Does the apparent shift in the sexual balance of control condemn the male sex to a kind of shiftless and baffled exclusion from committed participation in the central biosocial process To paraphrase Marx have men become alienated from the means of reproduction In strict behavioral terms the authors answer is yes Given the broad evolutionary canvas on which they draw their picture of contemporary sexuality and kinship the threatened selfsufficiency of females for reproductive purposes might be expected to drive men wild Freud evidently never asked the question What do men want But we can know what they are doing and not doing Overall in industrial societies proportionately fewer men are involved with raising fewer children than ever before in history The rich connectedness between men and women in sustaining the chain of life is evidently more tenuous than ever Nearly half the marriages in the United States end in divorce The Wedding March is almost a random walk Sterilization for both men and women is now this countrys most popular method of contraception and if one member of a couple is sterilized in effect two are According to the National Center for Health Statistics nearly half the couples of childbearing age in the United States cannot have babies  which must affect the overall sense of sexual robustness people enjoy Not that Mr Cherfas and Mr Gribbin assert that people should or should not have children But if only because we have ample dispiriting evidence from couples who want children and cannot there have to be rather farreaching psychosocial implications of even voluntary sterility It is surely a major event that the percentage of sterilized American couples has jumped from 15 percent in 1965 to about 39 percent in 1982 This must include the largest body of voluntarily sterile women in human history and they are making a remarkable and irrevocable private statement about their priorities and desires One can hardly overestimate the impact of this choice on intimate realities and on broad public ones such as the unprecedentedly low birthrate of much of the industrial world  we are barely replacing ourselves The other side of male redundancy rests on the sophistication of fertility medicine Do you remember the outcry that greeted Shulamith Firestones 1970 assertion in The Dialectics of Sex that the first demand of a new feminist system must be the freeing of women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology by every means available That freedom is indeed closer we can foresee that not only will fertilization take place outside the body but perhaps pregnancy also Premature babies are now able to survive at an age inconceivable a generation ago Furthermore the ease of artificial insemination obviously renders a palpable father irrelevant Since the technology for controlling the sex of offspring is no longer a fantasy not only will women be able to avoid the potentially turbulent and disruptive presence of a male progenitor but they may even choose to forgo having sons altogether A universal pattern of preference for a male as a first child may finally be reversed These are some of the questions that the philosopher Peter Singer incidentally a leading animal rights advocate and the Australian Member of Parliament Deane Wells discuss in Making Babies With calm and sensitivity they describe the new technologies show their economic and social cost and try to tame the various scandalsheet specters that abound  dictators producing proletarian clones babies growing in factory bottles fetuses implanted in druggedout surrogates sperm banks of the rich and famous Of course politicians and citizens alike must face very serious problems related to the ethical status and economic cost of many of the new technologies Nevertheless with almost triumphant sobriety Mr Singer and Mr Wells offer a plausible and practical context within which to approach each general issue such as abortion genetic engineering and testtube babies without losing sight of a good physicians sense of responsibility to individual patients They make a strong case for the desirability indeed necessity of communities establishing clear ways of responding to the new technology that affects the intimate experiences of countless people A kind of inner Environmental Protection Agency B UT is sex redundant and are males irrelevant Obviously the happy tumult of gender blending will continue to provide people with limitless opportunity for fun and games as well as serious continuity Happy couples are among the most envied of Americans How can others share what they have It is clearly useful to understand the basic elements that make up the sexual system if one wants to join it  even if one wants to beat it No one would make the claim that what currently confronts men is so problematic that they require special sympathy and understanding Nevertheless as a group males face a surprisingly new situation one that presents them with profound changes to consider and of course the response of men will elaborately affect women George Santayana announced that people who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it With prehistory  evolutionary history  the matter is somewhat more complex but also more challenging If we do not understand our evolutionary past we may try to repeat it too under decisively different and possibly unpropitious circumstances
THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE JOE PAPP,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/magazine/the-public-and-private-joe-papp.html,PACING BACK AND FORTH IN HIS cluttered office Joseph Papp lights up a Havana cigar and starts reciting some of the Dukes lines in Measure for Measure Papp is directing a new production of the play  which this weekend kicks off the Shakespeare Festivals 30th summer season  and his set and costume meeting has soon turned into a oneman exercise in acting Playing various characters Papp roams about the room punching the air for emphasis pulling his jacket lapels up for effect His intermittently interrupted monologue also bounds from subject to subject as he expounds upon his concept of the play sandwiching his opinions between puns lengthy asides on the quality of sunlight in Brooklyn sexual imagery in Henry IV and maybe a few bars from Hallelujah Im a Bum or Brother Can You Spare a Dime At 64 Papp has the quick fast movements of someone trained as a dancer or basketball player and one might easily mistake him for an actor  so swiftly does he slip in and out of impersonations moods and poses Listening to Papp talk is like listening to a Renaissance scholar on Benzedrine The voice is Brooklynese  neutralized by impeccable Elizabethan elocution the delivery brisk verging on manic While every opinion is announced with authority nothing seems to have been analyzed or subjected to internal debate  rather its spilled out contradictions and all for the listener to absorb The costume designer Lindsay Davis a young man meticulously dressed in a suit and tie is kneeling by the coffee table nervously scribbling down every word Papp utters while Robin Wagner the set designer who has known Papp for two decades sits slouched on the couch casually lobbing oneliners at the producer Matzohs for lunch Joe Youre turning into a religious fanatic I remember when I thought you were Greek You added a line  so now its going to be by William Shakespeare and Joseph Papp Papp ignores Wagners jibes Or perhaps he doesnt hear Talking about the character Angelo he is reminded of Harry Belafonte whom he saw the other night at a benefit Which reminds him that he wants to try to cast more black actors in Measure for Measure Which reminds him of changing demographics in the city Which reminds him of his plan to redesign the citys educational system He is most interested he says in the character of the Duke the head of state in the play who likes to go among his people dressed in disguise As Papp sees it the Duke is a great leader someone perceived by his people as abrupt and even cruel  but who also ends up being very human As a character says Papp later the Duke is totally inexplicable  a hundred times more complex than Jesus Christ Lindsay Davis wants to know how old Papp thinks a low comic character named Elbow is One hundred says Papp not missing a beat Hes a guy who falls asleep all the time an old guy  very tall and thin Those old skinny men they dont fall asleep says Robin Wagner This one does says Papp I know he does Of course he adds almost pausing everythings subject to change The sort of theater that Papp loves most are plays like Shakespeares plays that are epic in dimension drawn with great sweeping lines and filled with raw emotions plays that have a kind of ardent compassion where people are screaming at life And in person Papp himself projects a similar intensity a kind of unaccommodated and kinetic passion He hates being bored hates sameness inertia and silence and his own moods can vacillate between a dark melancholy and an almost electrical enthusiasm Equally fluent in the worlds of art and business he is decisive and direct  sometimes to the point of rudeness  impulsive and yet somehow deeply vulnerable There is something about him an imaginative sympathy that makes writers and actors want to confide in him impress him  or simply make him laugh and around the Public Theater headquarters for the Shakespeare Festival in the East Village they tend to pick up on his every mood echoing his responses with their own I think of him as a combination of a very intense and wily Talmudic scholar and a bad vaudeville comedian says the composer and playwright Elizabeth Swados I think hes very very sentimental which he dares to be in a time when most people are very aloof Although Measure a dark comedy about sex and politics is one of Shakespeares more problematic works Papp liked its ambiguities  and having decided to stage a show in Central Park for the festivals 30th anniversary season he embraced its textual difficulties as a wonderful directorial challenge MEASURE IS the 41st production that Papp has staged himself but he is not recognized mainly as a director It is as a producer a midwife to others talents that Papp has made his reputation and his influence on the theater consequently remains a highly personal affair measured less in terms of an esthetic vision or a single body of work than in terms of projects he has assembled and people he has affected  among many others such playwrights as David Rabe John Guare Wallace Shawn Michael Weller Thomas Babe and such actors as George C Scott Colleen Dewhurst James Earl Jones Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline If the last three decades have diminished neither Papps energy nor his passion for the theater they have witnessed remarkable changes The festival has evolved from a provisional acting workshop housed in the basement of a Lower East Side church into Americas largest theatrical arts institution and as its founder architect and presiding spirit Papp has become one of the most influential men in American theater today While he has been assailed for being too avantgarde on the one hand too commercial on the other the festival has developed an eclectic agenda over the years  an agenda that has included such disparate works as A Chorus Line Sticks and Bones Hair That Championship Season Short Eyes Marie and Bruce Dead End Kids The Pirates of Penzance and Plenty Under Papps leadership the festival has revivified classics and brought Shakespeare to the public helped bring radical new works into the mainstream given black Hispanic and AsianAmerican authors a valuable showcase and provided a model for notforprofit theaters around the country Joes shown more courage to do more things than anybody else says Bernard Jacobs the president of the Shubert Organization I think hes one of the major reasons we still have a theater today Of course as New Yorkers well know Papp also exerts a presence in the city that extends well beyond the theater A child of the ideological 1930s Papp has always been committed to using theater as a societal force  he set out to open the theater to the disenchanted and disenfranchised  and his own taste still inclines toward plays like Tracers Vietnam and The Normal Heart AIDS  plays that have something to say about contemporary issues Active on nearly a dozen cultural and social committees  from the Mayors Theater Advisory Council to Planned Parenthood  Papp often seems omnipresent in New York the proverbial model citizen and good Samaritan And in recent years he has also emerged as one of those public figures whose names appear in New Yorker cartoons and elicit strong opinions from people who havent met them  someone variously hailed and assailed as a punk version of Diaghilev the Don Quixote of the Great White Way and the David Merrick of the 70s PAPP DOES LITTLE to discourage the hyperbole like a politician on the campaign trail he cultivates even enjoys a high visibility I feel its important that the public be let in on everything he explains Im a public figure and a public figure should be in the public eye The theater needs it It gives you a certain amount of power to do things you want to do Publicity campaigns for the festival in fact have increasingly played up Papps role as figurehead of the institution At one point the picture of Shakespeare that stands at the center of the festivals insignia was replaced with one of the producer and last years advertising campaign for The Human Comedy featured a likeness of Papp on the shows program in newspaper advertisements and even on the Broadway marquee Such public displays of personality Papp explains are just good business and in a sense his role as a spokesman for the festival did begin as a publicity and fundraising tactic As Merle Debuskey a press agent associated with the festival since its start observes An institution cant be interviewed or photographed So we consciously tried to make Joe synonymous with the institution  he had to be known so the project would grow as we hoped At the same time though Papps identification with the festival is much more than a publicrelations gimmick  the producer himself experiences it as a visceral fact When the future of the theater is threatened he feels physically ill and he has taken negative reviews of shows as personal attacks When one critic dismissed David Rabes Boom Boom Room as an empty and poorly crafted play Papp rang him up on the phone and shouted You think youre going to get me Well Im going to get you The institution is Joe observes the playwright Thomas Babe and Joe is the institution Today that institution has five stages 110 fulltime employees and an annual budget of 10 million and Papp is in a position as the British playwright David Hare points out to put enormous resources into what he believes in and withhold resources from something he doesnt believe in Papps faith in his own judgment is absolute and at the Public his judgments are the only ones that really matter Hes unhappy with how an allmale production of Anthony and Cleopatra is proceeding  he cancels the show that afternoon Albert Innaurato wants to write a new scene for Coming of Age in SoHo featuring a family of eight Papp calls his casting department and the next day there are 23 suitable actors waiting to be auditioned He decides to move The Human Comedy to Broadway and he commits 400000 of the festivals money to the move Here at the Public says David Hare its Ruritania and the Emperor can do as he likes IN THE BEGINNING WHEN the festival was still a small acting workshop Papp became accustomed to doing everything himself  from directing shows to installing seats in the theater  and he still approves advertising copy for shows tries personally to sign all production contracts and makes a point of telling writers and actors in person what he thinks of their work Sometimes his impatience with bureaucracy and the democratic process also extends to the staging of shows In the case of Two Gentlemen of Verona he tore apart the production a week before the opening and produced a Broadway hit In the case of True West only acrimony and nasty headlines resulted  both the author Sam Shepard and the plays nominal director disowned the abortive production If a show has problems says Papp somethings got to be done And once Im involved its difficult for me to get involved halfway All or nothing remains the principle by which Papp has run the theater and his life If he decides to give minority performers more jobs he doesnt cast two or three actors in a show  he announces the formation of an entire black and Hispanic company If he wants to prevent the razing of some Broadway theaters he doesnt just sign a few petitions  he takes a hotel room in Times Square so he can spend 24 hours a day on the scene Such crusades may not succeed  as was the case with these two projects  and Papp may abandon one plan for another in a second but he says he never looks back He is a man who tries to live as though there were no past a man who willfully lives in the present Were he an actor he says the two roles he would most like to play are Hamlet and King Lear He would play Hamlet as someone out to usurp the throne from Claudius Lear as an irascible authority figure who just wants everyone to love him Papp has always had a weakness he says for oldfashioned Broadwaystyle dash glamour and risk and in a day when most arts institutions are run by committees he has developed a personal style reminiscent of such oldtime impresarios as Sol Hurok and Jed Harris In a 1978 cabaret act he dressed the part of an oldtime showman  appearing on stage in a top hat and tails carrying a silverheaded cane And on television commercials for the festival he affects the swaggering stance of a selfmade mogul  talking out of the side of his mouth and gesturing grandly with a cigar Even offstage there is something insistently theatrical about him Whether he is sweettalking a diffident actress threatening to lie down in front of a bulldozer during a demonstration or presenting his views of Broadway to a reporter his audience has the sense of watching a brilliant performance  often an entirely heartfelt performance full of real passion and commitment but a performance all the same I cant stand it when people are indifferent to me he says I dont mind it if they get angry want to kill me but I want some kind of reaction Papp has peremptorily stalked out of dinner parties and board of estimate meetings and written enraged letters to corporate executives who have ignored him  but most of the time such overt tactics arent required An astute observer of others he uses his intuition along with his charm and street smarts to get whatever he wants When it comes to fund raising for instance Papp will talk about maneuvering with the person on the other end of the phone  tap dancing as he says with their emotions playing upon their sense of civic responsibility their love of the arts even their fear of letting him down Control matters enormously to Papp  it is the reason he gets a rush of adrenalin from persuading a new patron to give money to the festival the reason he works out three times a week on a Nautilus machine and the reason of course that he loves to work in the theater Art gives order to his life provides him with a framework in which to function Even if a plays about a depressing subject its still a play he says Its under your control You know the show will be over in a certain time and in that time no ones going to get killed Most things in life are totally out of control but with a play theres a beginning a middle an end Youre not just going off into the wild blue yonder Figuring out an approach to a play like Measure negotiating the foreign rights to a new show trying to convince Mayor Koch to help save dying Broadway theaters  all are challenges that fill Papps compulsive need to orchestrate and one has the sense that he welcomes crises and confrontations as additional ways to test his intellect and reflexes In his initial fight to stage free Shakespeare in Central Park  the fight that first brought the festival into the public eye back in 1959  Papp successfully took on the allpowerful Parks Commissioner Robert Moses In 1973 he canceled a 7 million contract with CBS when it postponed David Rabes controversial Vietnam play Sticks and Bones And during his tenure at Lincoln Center the festival was theater constituent there between 1973 and 1977 he presented such grim disturbing works as Boom Boom Room and Short Eyes  plays that seemed deliberately chosen to upset uptown audiences complacent expectations There are few such battles to be fought today and Papp acknowledges that the success of the festival has made it increasingly difficult to take an adversarial role Early on he says I felt risk everything on one throw of the dice Now I have much more to lose  I have a huge institution I have a board of trustees I cant just violate everything Even though Papp still likes to think of himself as something of an outsider  he shows up at a benefit at Lincoln Center wearing gray suede shoes with his tuxedo uses a fourwheeldrive jeep as a limousine  he has become a member of the establishment he once took on Instead of going hat in hand to fundraising parties thrown by rich ladies in East Hampton like a trained monkey he recalls  he can now call up the president of CBS and ask directly for money His reputation and connections are enough to move a show to Broadway and when an attack on Mayor Koch in Larry Kramers recent play The Normal Heart produced nasty rumors in the press Papp settled matters by picking up the phone and talking directly with the Mayor Not that this state of affairs makes Papp particularly happy He talks a bit wistfully of old battles and former opponents adding I feel I have to be responsible but you also have to make sure that that word doesnt make you too cautious MANY EVENINGS ON the way to dinner or another show Papp will wander through the Public Theater through its labyrinth of theaters and lounges filled with young people dressed in sneakers and army pants and bright Tshirts and he will be reminded of the days when Broadway did not mean a hit show but an entire culture the days when cafes and hangouts like the Players Club were filled late at night with actors and directors and fans all debating the latest performances and plays And he will feel too a sense of belonging Its just a matter of touching base he says letting them know Im alive I care When I walk through the theater I try to make sure the public toilets are clean the lights are on properly Its like its my own place so I have a great deal of concern for how it looks Indeed the theater is where Papp lives He and his fourth wife Gail Merrifield  who is director of play development at the festival  have an apartment three blocks from the Public but with its pressedwood bookshelves and a diningroom table that doubles as a desk the place has a modest improvised feel His office at the Public on the other hand possesses all the amenities of home a fancy stereo system complete with a compactdisc player framed pictures of family and colleagues souvenirs from trips abroad as well as a wall thats covered floor to ceiling with awards including 23 Tonys 91 Obies and three Pulitzer Prizes I was talking to these students at City College the other day Papp recalls and they asked why did I start all this and I said I just wanted a home Like the first place we started at on 729 East 6th Street between Avenue C and D it was called the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church and I was so pleased to say This is my place  I live here  Even as a kid Papp seemed to be in search of a surrogate home He used to organize clubhouses on his block and in high school he took over a socialathletic club changing its name typically enough from the Mustangs to the Martyrs Papps family moved several times a year during that period  often in the middle of the night because his parents could not pay the rent and he remembers longing to live in a house with real lamps instead of bare light bulbs on the ceiling someplace that would give him the emotional sustenance he felt he lacked with his parents My father was very outgoing he recalls I think he loved me a lot My mother was very proper  she wasnt a cold woman but she didnt know how to express her feelings She seemed to want so much from me  I saw it in her eyes And Id do anything for her  I once climbed up to the fifth floor up this pole I had to shimmy up just to put up this laundry line for her If shed asked me to jump off I would have jumped The thing is you give a lot and sometimes get nothing back in return Theres this fear where youre called upon to give and give and theres no payment at all Because of this fear and because he tends to experience things very very deeply Papp says he learned early on to sometimes avoid dealing with it by not being involved He became a selfreliant child and as a young man he determined to get as far away as possible from the poverty of his familys immigrant life Having learned English as a second language  Yiddish was spoken at home  Papp fell in love with Shakespeares eloquent use of the words and he found in the Bards plays a way of escaping the bleakness of his menial jobs shining shoes hawking peanuts and plucking chickens Later after a wartime tour in the Navy took him to Hollywood he returned to the world of theater as a student at the Actors Laboratory and he also invented a new identity for himself He was Joe Papirofsky out of the Navy recalls Bernard Gersten his former associate producer who met him in 1948 That was it I didnt know he was Jewish I knew nothing about his parents Papp would later reembrace his familys Judaism would toy with the idea of restoring his original name he had shortened it to Papp during the 1950s when he was working as a stage manager at CBS and he would also pay tribute to his late father in his 1978 cabaret act  singing the songs his father once had loved Still the sense of detachment Papp learned as a child would be transferred from his parents to the five children of his first three marriages My personal life has been a very zigzaggy thing he says It took all my children to grow up before I began to have real relationships with them Now I have a good relationship with my two oldest daughters Susan and Barbara My son Tony I have a very good relationship with Miranda a fair relationship with One son I havent heard from in a long time  Michael hes sort of just disappeared When she was growing up recalls Miranda Papp who is now 27 she felt very close to her father though he was rarely home It is in recent years that she has come to feel his absence If I said to him Im broke Im desperate hell obviously respond she says but if I dont call him months will go by  I dont think he even realizes it About three years ago we had the last deep conversation weve had It was Christmas and he said he realized if Gail died hed be alone That was the most shocking thing he said to me I mean he realizes hes kind of pushed my brother and me away I told him Id like a closer relationship with him and he said Yes I want that too We both agreed wed make a big effort but he was like a man who comes up out of the sea for a moment to say Help me  and since then he hasnt come back up This is my image of him  that hes drowning in some way As for her brother Anthony who is now 23 he recalls that as a child he was jealous of the attention his father lavished on people at work It seemed like everyone else had him as a father for a while and I wanted more Papp too notes that it has been easier for him to develop intense relationships with artists and writers  people who are involved in the most important thing youre doing  than with his own children In the theater he says youre all doing the same thing and you can talk about things directly which you can never do at home Of course the theater by its very nature tends to encourage paternal relationships between actor and director writer and producer  and as head of the Shakespeare Festival Papp is in a position to be looked upon as a father figure When a janitor in the theater got his girlfriend pregnant and needed 150 for an abortion Papp was the one he turned to for help and when Miguel Pinero the author of Short Eyes was arrested Papp was the one who went down to the police station and bailed him out There was a time recalls one writer when anyone was in trouble Joe would be the first person theyd call When Papp decides he likes a particular writer he not only agrees to do his first play but promises to do his subsequent work as well  he makes it clear that hes embracing the writer as an individual not merely buying his work As a result a relationship frequently develops that is much more intense than any ordinary business or artistic alliance It was a kind of spiritual thing says Albert Innaurato recalling his experience working with Papp on Coming of Age in SoHo Id gone into it feeling my career was over but I would only have to talk to him for five minutes to feel an incredible input of energy He was there 24 hours a day  he became a colleague rather than a boss or producer In a business of intermittent employment short runs and uncertain futures the sense of an ongoing relationship that Papp offers can be extremely alluring  especially to writers and actors who are just starting out Its like a combination of high school summer camp and family says Elizabeth Swados the author of Runaways Thats why so many people fall head over heels in love with the place The problem is that at some point you also have to grow up and find your own family My personal experience was feeling confused I wondered what was mine before I became so involved in his incredible charisma I think almost everybody at one time or another has said I have to get out of here but nearly 85 percent of the people come back Joe can be very possessive and his possessiveness has caused innumerable crackups in relationships Papp himself speaks of understanding the problems King Lear has with authority and filial affection  He just wants Cordelia to say the right thing he says and the little bitch gives him all this intellectual bull But if he expects undivided caring loyalty and friendship from the artists he takes under his wing Papp says he also has the same problems sustaining intimacy with them that he has had with his own children It can be upsetting if you expect to try to hold on to something thats played itself out says Thomas Babe Joes openness can encourage people to place enormous expectations on him and if at that point Joe acts as producer and makes certain decisions it can become very confusing I admire his deep personal involvement but I think that means you have to protect yourself sometimes  thats why some people feel he might be cold or distant after the heat of battle David Rabe who says he benefited from Papps real creative insights on his first play The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel observes that with each successive play of his Papp seemed to have less and less time The Public had begun its huge rise to prominence Rabe recalls and decisions got made quicker and quicker Ultimately Joe was overextended  he was doing Broadway Lincoln Center Shakespeare in the park and plays at the Public It was too much and if youre one of the many events and you get shortchanged ill will develops In the beginning Joe offers a kind of haven and then when you feel youre not getting it you feel betrayed I think I lost something with David says Papp today Ill always love him but I could never give him all he wanted I was building a theater and you cannot build a theater and have strong relationships at the same time except with those people who are working with you Everyone expects you to be there all the time and its just not possible for me to be there for one person all the time Some of Papps longtime colleagues feel that in recent years as the actress Estelle Parsons puts it hes become more protective of himself more careful more aware of his position as a leader in the theater Certainly many of the people Papp was closest to at the festival have fallen by the wayside In 1978 after a disagreement over Michael Bennetts Ballroom Papp fired Bernard Gersten his associate producer and friend of 30 years And Merle Debuskey who has been with the festival since its beginning says he too feels increasingly distant from Papp All the people he was intimate with are gone now says Debuskey Its like hes one of those species of palm tree that grows very tall All the lower leaves fall off so only the leaves at the top are left That tree trunk when it grew had to be alone  anyone that might challenge it had to be cut off Joe cant stand there and be dragged down by anything including people Everything has to be discarded so you can move on CLEARLY PAPP HAS little time these days to have casual dinners with friends chat on the phone go away on weekends Even family matters have a way of turning into public affairs This year the familys annual Passover seder was filmed by a television crew from the MacNeil Lehrer NewsHour But while Papp enjoys being in front of an audience  he once thought of becoming a standup comedian  he says he could never be a professional actor because you must be too concerned with your own psyche He does not like to worry about himself he says and he has orchestrated his life in such a way that hes rarely ever alone Even in the midst of crowds however a part of him remains detached  separate and apart It is a feeling of isolation that Papp traces back to his childhood when he had the sense of living in a secret world cut off from those he loved Im rather outgoing but I dont feel that way he says softly I feel very much by myself When I was a kid I always felt lonely though I shouldnt have been I had brothers and sisters and friends but I guess it was mostly my mother who gave me that feeling There are lots of time now when I feel lonely for no reason I get plenty of attention from Gail and people are very supportive around the office But I dont know if thats what youre looking for really Its not discoverable  its an inner place that youve already made and it doesnt matter if youre busy or surrounded by people because you missed something when you were growing up and theres no way to replace that Some people try desperately to fill it up  drugs drinking sex I think work is relatively healthy  at least youre productive The festival certainly has thrived on Papps restless need to keep moving his singleminded devotion to its future Life is time he believes and there is never enough of it He hasnt taken a real vacation he estimates in two decades hasnt visited his country house in Katonah NY in a year complains he rarely gets a full nights sleep Already he has lined up 15 shows for the festivals next season and he is working on adding another 10 million to the festivals current endowment of 20 million Income from the long Broadway run of A Chorus Line has dropped from 6 million or 7 million a year to 1 million and Papp points out that the festival needs more shows that make money He thinks that this summers musical The Mystery of Edwin Drood has a 5050 chance of becoming a commercial hit and he believes that David Hares A Map of the World has Broadway potential too Also planned are trips to Nicaragua and Vietnam  to look for new plays a teaching stint at the University of Florida in Tallahassee and a blueprint for developing a new theater audience in New York that involves overhauling the entire school system Some of the ideas Im working on says Papp would require a whole new life to do In the meantime there are more benefits more projects more performances at what Papp calls culture baron things  where youre expected to put in an appearance On a recent Sunday for instance Papps schedule calls for a speech at Lincoln Center  the event is a tribute to the children of the Holocaust  followed immediately by a benefit for the Williamstown Theater at Studio 54 followed by another party Ten minutes after leaving Avery Fisher Hall Papp is standing on the glitterstrewn floor of the disco beneath a bank of humming red and purple neon lights exchanging greetings with Sam Waterston Joanne Woodward and Dick Cavett  making small talk about the state of Broadway and coining lots of bad puns The audience is quiet preoccupied  theres no connection says Papp between them and whats going on on stage and he starts his routine by telling them what he thinks This audience seems a little quiet for Studio 54 he says startling the sleepy patrons It seems like a funeral for someone dead and forgotten Its not your fault maybe its the acoustics or the dinner Anyway Ill just get on with the songs  some golden oldies He then begins his first number Youve got to accentuate the positive he sings in a loud voice swinging the mike back and forth working the audience Elimynate the negative Latch on to the affirmative Dont mess with Mister Inbetween   
CIVIL RIGHTS 'ESTABLISHMENT' FIRES BACK,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/weekinreview/civil-rights-establishment-fires-back.html,Once again last week civil rights lobbyists put the Reagan Administration on the defensive as a Senate committee considered the nomination of William Bradford Reynolds to be Associate Attorney General For the first time since President Reagan set out to reorder some of the civil rights policies of the Government the totality of his record was being critically reviewed by Congress The occasion was a confirmation hearing for Mr Reynolds the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights whom Mr Reagan wants to promote to the No 3 job in the Justice Department The Judiciary Committee on Thursday put off a vote on the nomination after it became clear that he would not win the panels endorsement Mr Reynolds has been engaged for four years in a running battle with what he calls the civil rights establishment If there is such an establishment its members are found in the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights a coalition of 175 national groups that is coordinating opposition to his nomination just as it orchestrated lobbying on the successful fight to extend the Voting Rights Act in 1982 For the battle over Mr Reynolds as for other campaigns the coalition has a steering committee that charts strategy The group includes Ralph G Neas the coalitions executive director Althea Simmons of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Elaine R Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Judith L Lichtman of the Womens Legal Defense Fund and Richard P Fajardo of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund Several factors account for the effectiveness of the civil rights lobby For one thing it is bipartisan For another it can mobilize the affiliates of its member organizations such as labor unions and the NAACP Additionally it has established relationships of trust with many influential members of Congress and their staffs And the lobby has a seemingly unmatched reservoir of experience and expertise in civil rights law including attorneys who helped write the basic statutes and have litigated major cases Contacts That Pay Off The Administration sometimes portrays the lobby as an arm of the Democratic Party But the lobbyists have excellent relations with many Republicans including Senators Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut as well as Representatives Hamilton Fish Jr of upstate New York and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island The lobbyists wellcultivated relationship with the Senate staff paid off in the hearings on Mr Reynolds The lobbyists suggested areas of inquiry that might prove embarrassing to the nominee and the Justice Department permitted Senate aides to review selected files Some of the documents obtained during that review including memorandums from Mr Reynolds to the Solicitor General on specific cases seemed to contradict his testimony For his part he said that he had had no intent to deceive but he acknowledged that my recollection may have failed me at times For example he said he had been in error when he testified that he had met with opponents of a Congressional redistricting plan for Louisiana and that lawyers for black voters in Mississippi had agreed with his decision not to file lawsuits on their behalf A memorandum with a pointbypoint rebuttal to the major charges has now been sent to key senators In a paradoxical way the Reagan Administration has galvanized the civil rights lobby forcing its members to work together more closely With ideological conservatives in charge of the Justice Department and key Senate subcommittees Mr Neas said fear is a rather substantial motivating force We see everything that has been achieved in civil rights in the last two or three decades as being in jeopardy Walter E Williams a conservative economist and professor at George Mason University in Virginia says the civil rights movement has lost a considerable amount of respectability in recent years Its members are no longer talking about constitutional guarantees he said They want entitlements  food stamps a certain percentage of jobs or college admissions Thats not civil rights thats dividing up turf Clearly the civil rights groups are less cohesive on some issues including employment quotas and abortion While some blacks and Hispanic Americans favor quotas as a lastresort remedy to job discrimination many Jewish groups oppose their use The Roman Catholic Church disagrees with womens groups and others who want to guarantee availability of abortion On those two issues the Leadership Conference takes no position Mrs Lichtman executive director of the Womens Legal Defense Fund says the civil rights lobbyists are most effective when we can articulate our concerns as issues of fairness and justice That was true for example with respect to voting rights and tax exemptions for segregated schools By contrast she said it is very difficult to capture national attention when the issues are more technical and legalistic though such technical issues may be just as important

"AT VILLAGE VOICE, A CLASHING OF VISIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/28/nyregion/at-village-voice-a-clashing-of-visions.html,With the sale of The Village Voice last week one of the most internally divisive and bitter periods in that fractious oftenradical newspapers history has entered a quieter phase at least temporarily But though a calm has settled over The Voices cluttered headquarters in the East Village just beneath the surface lie strongly clashing visions among staff members of what The Voice should be as it begins operations under the weekly newspapers fifth owner Many on the staff are eager for change as The Voice nears the end of its 30th year with profits reportedly strong but readership stagnant among those 24 years old and younger We need someone to come in and treat The Voice like an Oriental rug and shake the dust out said Jan Hoffman a staff writer First Priority According to a 1984 survey by the Scarborough Research Corporation which does market research the papers readers are getting older David Schneiderman the publisher and editor in chief of The Voice said his first priority as publisher was to make sure we dont lose our younger readers According to Mr Schneiderman a different survey commissioned by The Voice found that its readers bought the paper for its coverage of film music and politics in that order with other subjects generating smaller demand New coverage of business science and medicine he said are subjects I hope to go into within six months According to the Scarborough survey 25 percent of the newspapers readers live in Manhattan with Brooklyn and Queens second and third The Audit Bureau of Circulations report of March 31 lists The Voices circulation at 151000 The Scarborough survey reported that about half of The Voices readers were single and had never been married and Mr Schneiderman said this unusually high percentage reflected the papers large homosexual readership Since 1980 according to the survey The Voice has attracted a higher percentage of black Hispanic and other minority readers which now represent 31 percent of its audience and more than 60 percent of the readers are male Battling Factions Factions within The Voice the bestestablished and one of the oldest of the nations socalled alternative newspapers have battled since January for primacy as the paper searched for a new top editor In January Mr Schneiderman who had been the editor accepted the publishers position at the paper but continued to serve as interim editor in chief while a new editor was sought The decision this spring by its publisher Rupert Murdoch to sell The Voice prompted a new round of infighting in an atmosphere made all the more explosive by uncertainty over who the new owner would be according to many staff members The worst of the uncertainty ended on June 20 when Leonard Stern the multimillionaire owner of Hartz Mountain Industries a New Jersey company that makes pet products paid more than 55 million for The Voice and pledged not to interfere with its editorial affairs Mr Stern who describes himself as a liberal on civil rights and social issues and as right of center on defense issues said he would not step in even if Voice writers attacked him in the paper as they did Mr Murdoch who also publishes The New York Post The Times of London and other papers A Business Decision Mr Stern described the Voice purchase which he said did not require borrowing money as not an extension of my ego or political beliefs but very much a business decision Though he noted that he has been an infrequent reader of the newspaper since his college days at New York University he said that he loved the Village Voice As a demonstration of his satisfaction with both the newspapers profitability and current editorial direction Mr Stern invited Mr Schneiderman to retain both the editor and publisher titles Industry analysts estimate that The Voice has annual profits of 5 million before taxes but no financial or advertisinglinage data are issued for the paper On Tuesday Mr Schneiderman agreed to keep both titles somewhat to the dismay of some of the papers staff members who felt that the two positions should not be held by the same person Because a publishers fundamental responsibility is the financial wellbeing of a newspaper editors and reporters have traditionally preferred to keep their news judgments independent of business considerations But though the issue of who will provide the top editorial leadership has been settled the warring factions remain and the way The Voice will evolve is unresolved Traditional Emphasis In broad terms one of the newspapers factions outspokenly defends the newspapers traditional emphasis on politics This group fights giving frontpage play and generous space to softer subjects such as rock music and the eating habits of young urban professionals or yuppies The other group denounces the papers political coverage as dull and predictable and says the papers political writers hog the coveted space in the newspapers front section that should include more articles on modern culture and social issues such as feminism and homosexual rights But in one respect almost all staff members agree editors essentially should not edit and reporters have the right to say anything they want in their articles without the constraint of objectivity and balance in news coverage that is the goal of most traditional newspapers One of the hallmarks of Village Voice columnists and writers is to take strong political positions usually of the left and carry on concerted attacks on individuals and institutions they dislike One of their favorite targets is The New York Times We are not objective reporters we dont pretend that said Mr Schneiderman whose muscle as editor in chief lies mostly in his power to choose what will be touted on the front page and how much space an article will be given rather than in editing the articles that appear Mr Schneiderman who is 38 years old says The Voice as an advocacy newspaper is not looking for balance but is fair in that it considers and includes opposing arguments The Voice he says is aggressive edgy and fearless But some critics of The Voice fault the paper for being fearless without a corresponding concern for accuracy In its early days The Voice was a place where people had the freedom to write what they want and be as perceptive or as muddleheaded as our abilities allowed said Howard Blum a former reporter for The Voice and The New York Times who has written a soontobe published novel about a newspaper not unlike The Voice But Mr Blum added over the years that freedom has been bashed around by careless reporters who didnt care about truth at all but just points of view Writing Essays According to present and former Voice staff members the rigor of checking facts and selecting what facts are used in articles is left almost entirely to the discretion of the writer In many cases they are writing essays and selecting the facts to support a point of view and they say the other side is represented in other newspapers said Cynthia Crossen a former managing editor of The Voice who left last year to become an editor at The Wall Street Journal Since The Voices first issue in October 1955 its unrestrained and opinionated writing has been the papers main attraction to both its readers and to the people who fill its columns with their words Over the years The Voice has scored some journalistic coups such as its early coverage of the financial affairs of Bert Lance then the director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter The papers coverage of the dangers of lead paint have drawn critical praise and in 1981 Teresa Carpenter a Voice staff writer was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing based on crime reporting The Experimental and New The Voice devotes a great deal of space to the coverage and criticism of the more avantgarde dimensions of music film and other cultural areas and the paper has been a force in nurturing the experimental and new For example Andrew Sarris The Voices longtime movie critic is credited by many with being a very important factor in the popularization of avantgarde films But critics of the paper who include both friends and enemies of its political positions say that what was once fresh and lively opinionated writing  especially on politics  has become polemical and predictable in its radicaltoliberal perspective on almost every issue Though The Village Voices political coverage commands a certain following local politicians and political scientists say it has lost much of its power to surprise and with it much of its power to influence the opinions of others I dont think The Voice influences the making of policy or judgments made by politicians said Edward L Sadowsky the chairman of the New York City Councils Finance Committee who added that the newspaper has generally been kind to him On the other hand he said their role is essential because what they do is tweak noses Some Surprising Views But while some staff members say Voice articles are often too long and often predictable they note that the papers writers still sometimes surprise each other with their views For instance Mr Hentoff has expressed sympathy and support for those opposed to abortion a position unlike that of most on the staff Probably no one has drawn more persistent negative coverage in The Voice than has Mayor Koch who has not granted the paper an interview in many years Some of The Voices readers say they perceive an antiIsrael bias in the newspaper Staff members say the paper has many writers and articles that could be considered proIsrael and they suggest that the perception may have sprung from the writing of Alexander Cockburn a strong critic of Israel Mr Cockburn was dismissed in 1984 by Mr Schneiderman for accepting a 10000 grant from the Institute of Arab Studies a nowdefunct research organization to write a book on the Israeli invasion of Lebanon Mr Schneiderman termed it a conflict of interest and said at the time that Mr Cockburn had damaged the credibility of The Voice while Mr Cockburn characterized the reaction as pompous handwringing The original owners of The Voice Dan Wolf and Ed Fancher sold it in 1971 to Carter Burden and Bartle Bull who in turn sold it to Clay Felker in 1974 Some longtime Voice staff members say the most recent bout of bitter dissension at the newspaper has its roots in the Felker period when Mr Felker tried to move The Voice from a heavily political newspaper to one that gave more emphasis to life styles and trends Threats of a Walkout With Mr Murdochs purchase of The Voice in 1977 the staff was united against a common enemy When Mr Murdoch tried to dismiss The Voices editor soon after acquiring the paper there were threats of a mass walkout by staff members and he backed down Two years later Mr Schneiderman left The New York Times where he was assistant editor of the OpEd page to become editor in chief of The Voice but only after his appointment was delayed several months at the insistence of The Voices staff until the former editor Marianne Partridge finished her contracted term as editor Because there were  and are  so many competing factions at the paper Mr Schneiderman adopted a policy of not socializing with anyone which he still largely observes According to Voice staff members the struggle is largely between the papers political writers and the groups identified by staff members as the sexualpoliticos whose political interests are oriented toward social issues and the artsyintellectuals who include the more cultureoriented staff members Fierce Arguments For months fierce arguments have erupted almost weekly over what articles should be given prominent display And the arguments sometimes have found their way into print with staff members denouncing each other in The Voice Mr Hentoff for example has traded barbs with Karen Durbin a senior editor over the abortion issue Such exchanges are part of the Voice tradition but recent exchanges were considered to be particularly angry The atmosphere became so charged that most of those in the newsroom would not speak to the others according to staff members The frosty newsroom climate which persists prompted one staff member to place a memo in everyones mailbox last Monday suggesting that in this time of dealing with a new owner maybe we can start talking to each other In fact the memo said maybe we can say Hello a quite revolutionary leap forward in this joint
Legal Abortion Backed By Spanish Parliament,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/28/world/legal-abortion-backed-by-spanish-parliament.html,The Spanish Parliament enacted a law legalizing abortion today ending a 40yearold ban on the procedure in this predominantly Roman Catholic country The lower house of Parliament voted 193 to 56 with eight abstentions to approve the law decriminalizing abortions in cases of rape or danger to the mothers mental and physical health or when the fetus is believed to be deformed The vote followed a twoyear battle involving the laws Socialist sponsors the main conservative opposition coalition and the Roman Catholic Church Three months ago Spains constitutional court ruled that parts of an earlier law legalizing abortions were unconstitutional but upheld the principle of abortion in certain cases The Socialists amended the bill to meet the courts demand that the law strengthen provisions to safeguard the mothers health The Socialists also added amendments stipulating that danger to the mothers physical or mental health was sufficient grounds for an abortion The original version required that the pregnancy pose a danger to the mothers life Publicopinion polls show that a majority of Spaniards favor abortion for medical reasons despite the churchs opposition The courts ruling on the law April 11 opened the way for the passage of the amended version which ended a ban imposed in 1944 under the dictatorship of Gen Francisco Franco
"ART: AT THE WHITNEY, MICHAEL HEIZER WORK",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/28/arts/art-at-the-whitney-michael-heizer-work.html,ALMOST walltowall and floortoceiling Michael Heizers single work Dragged Mass Geometric occupies the main gallery on the fourth floor of the Whitney Museum Madison Avenue at 75th Street so fully that theres hardly room for the viewer A huge hulk of linear forms and cubic volumes its a cleanedup schematic view of Dragged Mass a messy outdoor piece that he did 14 years ago for the Detroit Institute of Arts in which tractors dragged a 30ton granite block back and forth over the ground The movement displaced 300 tons of earth fulfilling its mission to produce an impressive pile of dirt some 8 feet high and 40 feet long The earlier piece  no longer extant  was one of the more citified of the mammoth earth works that the multitalented Heizer has been doing since 1967 mainly in the desert lands of California and Nevada Dragged Mass Geometric is an attempt to engineer  recast in the form of a threedimensional drawing so to speak  not only the substance but also the process of the earlier work A temporary structure made entirely of cardboard sheets over an armature of metal trusses and measuring 115 feet long by 16 12 feet high by 46 feet wide it gives an abstract reading of the granite block itself in the act of forming its big dirt pile Long linear windrows represent the earth thrown up at the sides of the block by its motion Even the hole is made evident by cantilevering the main mass of the structure to leave under it a visible space The cardboard surface used by Heizer as a material similar in its humbleness to dirt is silkscreened with photographic material taken from various geologic sources  rock grain mud minerals The wild and audacious result of Heizers labors is not much to look at in terms of conventional sculpture But its huge looming bulk with its rambling geometric forms and angles its tight containment in the gallerys space so that the viewer can never read it as a whole and its impressive engineering give it considerable impact as an architectural environment At the same time poking around and in it a ramp in the structure allows for a partial overview one also gets the feeling of a scifi movie set of ruins left by androids For those of us who cant get to the farflung sites of Heizers outdoor works the Whitney has plastered the walls of adjoining galleries with photographs blown up to mural size of a representative selection Among the more formidable desert endeavors are Double Negative a pair of corridors 50 feet deep and 1500 feet long cut in a mesa Complex One an earth mastaba 140 feet long banded from a distance by vertical and horizontal columns of concrete that are actually separate elements when seen close up and a series of largescale line drawings in dry lake beds collectively titled Nine Nevada Depressions More recently shown here as a photograph of the model there is Effigy Tumuli five earth mounds compressed into animal shapes each up to 1000 feet long and 25 feet high and deployed over a mile of land that Heizer is doing as a coal mine reclamation project in Ottawa Ill While the photographs of course cant begin to convey the dramatic impact that the works make when seen live they do give a sense of their spectacular scale and siting The truth is that Heizer is a master of landscapesize imagery Hes at his best when moving earth and rock into vast configurations whose interest comes from the tension they create between human artifact and that made by nature But seen against his larger conceptions his smaller works are not nearly so convincing His show at the Whitney through Sept 1 overshadows the concurrent one around the corner at Xavier Fourcade 36 East 75th Street through Sept 14 in which more portable takehome objects are presented There are several wonderful things here to be sure One using 50 photographic prints arranged in a large circle recapitulates the 500foot circle Heizer imprinted on a dry Nevada lake bed in 1970 by means of motorcycle tires Another is a pair of etchings made from scrapmetal pieces embellished with additional markings that recall in flat scheme a largescale sculpture called Platform commissioned by the Oakland Museum in 1980 But most of the smallscale sculpture here looks bland in light of his larger works Several drawings based on silkscreen reproductions of photographs of large works are too prettily punched up with high chromatics and tricked out with notations scribblings brush strokes etc Less gimmicky but not too engrossing either are texture paintings made by tracking rollers impregnated with black pigment over canvas By and large the Fourcade show tends to prove that Heizers own instincts which are to stay away from work of comfortably salable size are quite correct Scale is his metier Also of interest this week Tony Bechara Museo del Barrio 1230 Fifth Avenue at 104th Street Ancient mosaics Islamic tiles pointillism and what he calls the controlled chaos of New York Citys streets are among the sources for Tony Becharas gridded paintings Seen up close theyre composed of tiny squares of color created by overlaying the canvas with quarterinch tape then applying pigment Backed away from their busy surfaces become shimmering eloquent compositional arrangements developed by chromatic concentration of the squares to form abstract configurations In Night Music for example a particularly beautiful work surges of bluish reds and blacks emerge from the particolored ground to produce a kind of floral  well vibration one hesitates to call it a pattern Arhythmic intensities of black red and blue give Thunder its stormy feeling And sometimes the squares form a dense overall surface lyrically patterned by the play of light alone as in the freestanding threepart panels of Three Graces Ranging over five years this selection of Becharas work gives the museum devoted to the art of Caribbean peoples its first exhibition of abstract art Its a scintillating choice Through Aug 31 Social Studies Barbara Gladstone Gallery 152 Wooster Street Work by six socially involved artists gives this small show its title though not a good deal of coherence The mix is too loose and with each artist represented by only one item the overall impact is diffuse Sue Coe weighs in with one of her lurid tabloids Vigilante a white hoodlum shooting down two black youths on a subway platform Eric Fischl suburbanbaits as usual in Birth of Love a fleshy sullenly lighted poolside scene in which a youth lays explorative hands on a leering woman Bill Woodrows Call of the Wild made entirely from car hoods is a savage sculptural fantasy in which a bearlike creature beaten into a flat rug barks into three microphones And then there are contributions by Jenny Holzer and Leon Golub But the real coup is an endeavor by Tim Rollins who works in a South Bronx public school and KOS a group of some 40 teenagers who collaborate with him Their Amerika made after a discussion of the Franz Kafka novel is a jubilant mural of quirky musical horns each painted gold and almost humanoid in form networked on a ground of pastedup pages from the novel Its explained as an allegory of social democracy which doesnt quite account for its wonderful pizzazz Through July 26 Private Gone Public Soho 20 469 Broome Street Another show of work by six gut issue artists  this time all women  assembled by the art critic Ellen Lubell Two Bonnie Lucas and Erika Rothenberg are wits and sly ones at that Lucas makes clever assemblages of baby clothes and female fripperies laces ribbons glitter fake jewelery etc  in notsodemure compositions that put down accepted female roles Rothenbergs cartoony panels present such concepts as the Right to Life Boutique for men purveying antiabortion trinkets Sue Coe  again  and Howardena Pindell express their political concerns via specific events Coes painting depicts the death of Bobby Sands the Irish hunger striker attended by a leering cast of political military and clerical figures Pindell makes Hiroshima the subject of her richly textured wall pieces into which she inserts photo transfers of maimed hands and wrecked buildings May Stevenss contribution is a moving study of her mothers ordinary life here seen in passage from youth to dazed old age The least of these works are Nancy Speros small sketchy prints in which friezelike figures and heads of women are attitudinized in revolutionary poses But overall its an eloquent little show Through

AIDS CHILDREN STRUGGLE WITH TRAGIC LEGACY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/01/nyregion/aids-children-struggle-with-tragic-legacy.html,Dr James Oleske pulled a plush rabbit from the pocket of his lab coat but was unable to quiet his 4yearold patient Instead Dr Oleske turned the restive boy from his back to his stomach and prescribed Valium as a sedative See you old buddy Dr Oleske said leaving the hospital room with a salute and a strained smile Then he approached a staff physician Resuscitate Dr Oleske said but no respirator The child was dying of AIDS the viral disease that destroys the immune system of both its adult and its child victims Last fall the boy had been holding his own walking and talking until the virus attacked his central nervous system Now he lay at Childrens Hospital in Newark mute but for intermittent weeping immobile but for spasmodic movements in his stiffened legs He is 1 of the about 600 children nationwide who health experts estimate have either AIDS acquired immune deficiency syndrome or preliminary symptoms of the disorder More than 300 are in the New York area most born to mothers who are intravenous drug users Many of the mothers do not display symptoms but may themselves eventually sicken and die Since AIDS was identified in adults in 1981 the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have reported 11271 cases and 5641 deaths most of them male homosexuals and intravenous drug users According to the Federal definition of pediatric AIDS which requires the presence of an opportunistic lifethreatening infection and the elimination of all other possible immunological disorders 132 of these victims were children 97 of whom have died Doctors researchers and healthcare professionals say that for every child with AIDS there are three or four with a condition known as AIDSrelated complex The related condition tends to precede AIDS the doctors say These children are often born to disintegrating families already riddled by poverty and drug addiction Sometimes their parents are incompetent or too sick to raise them and they are placed in foster care before their illness is diagnosed Other times they are abandoned in the hospital by natural or foster families unwilling or unable to nurse them And even if the natural parents struggle to manage their ailing families often they do not live long enough to complete the task Dr Arye Rubinstein who has treated 92 such youngsters at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx calls them the children of fractured families Sometimes he said the whole family is dying The people we take care of are a very disenfranchised group said Dr Oleske a pediatric immunologist who noted that drug abusers were a population less organized and more scorned than other groups at risk for AIDS With two or three new cases of pediatric AIDS diagnosed locally each month policy makers are taking action Dr Rubinstein was awarded 400000 by New York City last month to establish a daycare center in the Bronx for the children This summer with the advice of healthcare professionals who stress their strong belief that the disease is not contagious through casual contact both New York City and New Jersey will promulgate guidelines that could admit AIDS children to public school next fall If theyre well enough to go to school theyre not a risk to other children said Dr David J Sencer the Health Commissioner of New York City where last year a handful of AIDS children were instructed at home But its going to take a lot of patient discussion not only with the Board of Education but with the community at large Role of Drug Addiction Everyone agrees that under proper circumstances these children should be mainstreamed said Joseph Mancini a spokesman for the New York City Board of Education One foster mother of a 3yearold child with AIDSrelated complex who had been abandoned in a hospital for 20 months after being diagnosed said she was more afraid of society than of her foster daughters illness The 44yearold woman said she had considered lying as she has to neighbors and friends in order to enroll her child in a regular nursery school program Some people think thats evil said the woman who has been shunned by family members and friends But if shes going to have a short life I want it to be a full life The womans foster daughter like most AIDS children in the New York area was infected by a drugaddicted mother Nationally about half the AIDS children are born to women who were intravenous drug users or who were infected through sexual contact by drugusing mates In New York 80 children have been diagnosed as having AIDS according to the Centers for Disease Control definition and 70 percent of the cases have been traced to drug use usually by the mother Uncertainties Remain Local doctors report that they are seeing more cases from middleincome families often in situations where the woman was unaware of her mates drug habit Theres social chaos on all levels of society said Dr Jane Pitt who has treated about 35 children with AIDS or AIDSrelated complex at ColumbiaPresybyterian Medical Center Less frequently children have been infected with AIDS because of a mothers sexual contact with a bisexual man or because of contaminated transfusions Medical experts are unsure whether AIDS children are infected in the womb or during birth or what percentage of children born to infected women are affected Local doctors tell many stories about mothers who give birth to more than one AIDS child But in the face of limited data that seem to indicate a substantial risk in a second pregnancy the doctors are divided on the ethics of encouraging abortion Many doctors say that in general pregnancy affects a womans immune system and therefore increases the risk of developing AIDS for women who are carrying the virus They want a survivor said Dr Rubinstein explaining why women often shun his advice not to have another child Foster Families Only 12 percent of the mothers of AIDS children nationwide actually had the disease during pregnancy according to the Centers for Disease Control But the birth of an AIDS child is a signal that the mother is carrying the virus said Dr Polly Thomas a pediatric immunologist in the New York City Health Department Many AIDS children born to addicted mothers are already in foster care when their illness is diagnosed and such foster parents often keep the children The goodness of these parents I cant tell you said Anita Septimus a social worker in Dr Rubinsteins unit who said foster mothers were much more likely to attend support groups than natural mothers whose guilt and denial is unbelievable Abandoned AIDS children are extremely difficult to place with families according to Harry Silverstein the director of placement at the Office of Special Services for Children a division of the citys Human Resources Administration Sixteen AIDS children have come to the attention of Mr Silversteins agency in the last two years Two have died three live with relatives one was returned to a foster family and three have been placed after publicity campaigns Seven homeless AIDS children remain in New York City hospitals although they are not sick enough to require inpatient care Most doctors and social workers say fear  of contagion and of loss  is what inhibits prospective foster parents New York City pays foster parents 250 to 350 a month and certain categories of children entitle a foster parent to 5 a day extra which Mr Silverstein said was not automatic for AIDS children until recently After the Diagnosis Dr Rubinstein and Dr Oleske disagree about how to deal with children who are still with their natural parents at the time of diagnosis Dr Rubinstein said I always send them back because a bad family environment is better than no family environment His social worker Mrs Septimus said some addicted mothers responded to their childrens illness by reshaping their lives while others became more irresponsible under the new stress Dr Oleske said The worst possible care provider is a drugaddicted woman He occasionally urges social workers to remove a child from its natural mother The Newark doctor is treating 22 AIDS children nine are in foster care six because the natural mother died and three because the mother was judged unfit One 2yearold girl at Childrens Hospital has been hospitalized for 16 months because her teenage mother is not capable of caring for her The child in the final stages of the disease which often ends with pulmonary or neurological failure was put on a respirator and the mother has stopped visiting Waiting for a Cure Often the children are initially labeled as failure to thrive babies with symptoms of immunological failure usually appearing by six months In children with AIDS not just its preliminary symptoms an infection often pneumonia  usually occurs by the age of 12 months In 80 percent of those cases the child is dead within two years Both Dr Oleske and Dr Rubinstein vigorously treat infections in AIDS children and subscribe to an experimental program in which gamma globulin a blood product containing antibodies is administered intravenously Dr Oleske reports that five children on the program are alive four years after diagnosis and three of those are showing improvement in their immune systems Dr Rubinstein said his star patients are two 7yearolds whose symptoms were detected at 12 months and subsequently diagnosed as AIDS Neither doctor cites these cases as an indication that the progress of the wasting disease can be halted their goal is to keep patients alive as long as possible in the hope of a cure Every month we gain every day we gain is worthwhile Dr Rubinstein said But theres no delusion that were doing anything dramatic Dr Oleske said All we can give these children is good supportive care When Hope Ebbs At the stage of severe neurological impairment both doctors cease the most aggressive treatment The brain just shrinks away like Alzheimers Dr Rubinstein said They lose milestones and stop talking walking sitting Once that happens we throw up our hands That sounds terrible but you have to draw the line somewhere Dr Oleske set a similar standard when he decided against a respirator for his 4yearold patient at Childrens Hospital after neurologists advised that the AIDS virus had irreversibly affected the brain When it hits the vital centers we fail he said Parents Mrs Septimus said are loath to confront the severity of the disease in their offspring or themselves She considers this reluctance a blessing because she said a fearful woman is more likely to abandon her child Typical she said was the foster mother of the 3yearold child with AIDSrelated complex who has been hospitalized once in the last six months with pneumonia recently contracted a skin infection after a swim in a hotel pool and has chronically enlarged organs and glands The foster mother a hospital administrator said Im convinced shes going to lick it and she bristles at what she considers alarmist doctors A believer in therapeutic touch the mother said that each night she rubbed her daughters belly and back I say Spleen go down and its already gone down she said Next Ill do the liver and then the lymph glands My Heart Goes Bang For the doctors such hope is more elusive Dr Oleske said there were days when it was nearly impossible to put on his optimistic face that he had not anticipated dealing with so many dying children and wasnt emotionally ready for it Dr Rubinstein said that he protected himself from burnout by delegating many emotional chores to his social workers But Mrs Septimus said the doctor was always the one to tell parents that their child was about to die Ive heard it time and again she said and each time my heart goes bang  Lately Dr Rubinstein said staff members regularly weep in his office There is so little hope at the end of the tunnel he said And the misery of the family  everyone is involved I dont know of any other disease that does this Its good in your head to think you can walk out on the job Mrs Septimus said but even if you wanted to go back to the same little life you couldnt do it because you look at your own humanity in a different way But there are days when I feel like screaming What did they do to deserve this

The Perfect Contraceptive: When?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/01/opinion/the-perfect-contraceptive-when.html,Now that thousands of American drugstores maintain a familyplanning center its hard to believe that state laws forbidding birth control by married couples were struck down only 20 years ago Americans now assume that contraceptives are available to all They are wrong More than three million American women experience unintended pregnancies each year Only 41 percent of the worlds married couples of reproductive age use modern means of contraception For some of those who dont contraception is undesirable For countless others it is unavailable or unsafe No available contraceptive is ideal and some of the more effective ones like the pill and the IUD are apt to produce side effects The condom is culturally rejected in many places Sterilization is highly effective but usually irreversible All else failing more than 40 million women a year resort to abortion which is surely not contraception Whats needed then are contraceptives that are safe effective easy to use and inexpensive and better methods of counseling about their use Nor should they be only for women The prototype for the modern condom appeared in the 16th century Surely its more than time for the development of a new male contraceptive Will they be available any time soon Not nearly soon enough to prevent millions of unintended pregnancies large numbers of them ending in maternal death or abortion The world spent only 175 million for research in the field last year most of it for reproductive biology rather than contraceptive development Some experts think it would take at least 500 million a year over several decades to exploit promising new leads in longacting antifertility vaccines and reversible nonsurgical methods of sterilization Such research isnt possible in the third world which is where its needed most therefore the burden falls on the West  on American and international agencies foundations and pharmaceutical companies Should their investment succeed the return would be extraordinary They would have done the world a favor
A VIGOROUS FEMINIST IN THE FRENCH CABINET,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/01/style/a-vigorous-feminist-in-the-french-cabinet.html,Yvette Roudy Frances Minister for Womens Rights likes to show visitors the artwork by women that is on the walls of her office near the Arc de Triomphe She says there has long been a prejudice against women in the art world that makes it more difficult for them to gain recognition She distributes matchbooks printed with photographs of reknowned feminists of the past such as Rosa Luxemburg and others Outside her office near the entry to the ministry hangs a poster showing a freckled teenage girl flexing her biceps next to the slogan At school we can aim in all directions For Mrs Roudy who has become the most visible and ardent advocate in France of womens rights equality for women is a matter of small symbols and gestures as well as large ones Mrs Roudy a longtime friend of President Francois Mitterrand was named head of the new ministry when the Socialist Party was swept into power in 1981 Since then she has become what the French call un personnage a personality and a figure of occasional controversy as she has pressed for Government action on behalf of women Right to Contraception She has waged television campaigns on what she calls the womans right to contraception she has negotiated with Government ministries to hire more women she has asked schools to help interest girls in technology she has overseen television documentaries on great women of the past to prevent the loss she says of an aspect of French culture She has been ridiculed for creating a commission to feminize the French language meaning to give feminine forms to the names of jobs and positions held by women All of this considerable activity she says is a matter of catching up for France a country that in her view has lagged behind others in the West in giving women equal protections and opportunities I believe that machismo in France is stronger Mrs Roudy said in a recent interview comparing the situation in France with that in other Western countries In the United States you have the great tradition of the pioneers Its not an accident that it was Wyoming that first gave the right to vote to women The women who came there made decisions they fought they were needed Here she continued the social customs are much more conservative because traditional structures are more deeply fixed We also have the Catholic religion which I think its true to say has been less liberal toward women than the Protestants We also have the Mediterranean influence which is more sexist in its traditions than the north But I think that during the past four years I have managed to change the way of thinking a little bit in some areas Mrs Roudy said The President of the republic was telling me the other day in front of four or five people  he said Yvette you have succeeded in changing the mentality in certain areas and that is not easy  Since coming to the Ministry for Womens Rights Mrs Roudy has clearly shown herself to favor direct intervention by the state in womens affairs Most important perhaps she has overseen the passage of three laws that give the Government a greater role in insuring the interests of women What the Laws Do One prohibits discrimination against women in hiring and in fixing salaries another allows women to be reimbursed by social security for the medical expenses of abortions and the third creates a Government bureau that makes the childsupport payments owed by one parent to another after a divorce Mrs Roudy says that by creating an intermediary between the parents conflicts that often arise over childsupport payments can be avoided And if a father fails to make payments the state provides an advance to the mother and tries to make the father pay We are behind in many respects in France she said particularly in the area of professional equality I mean that in the bureaucracy there were many job categories where barriers had been put up against women There were quotas in the police in customs in the army in the Office of the Budget even and Im thinking of something quite funny among the keepers of locks  women were excluded from jobs operating locks on waterways Resistance and Progress I negotiated with the Government ministry involved with the unions and I got the Prime Minister to arbitrate she said In one case she said the police raised their hiring quota for women from 2 percent to 20 percent There is a lot of resistance Mrs Roudy said a lot of effort to get around the decisions But slowly it is moving ahead In all of this Mrs Roudy is a presence on the feminist scene and maintains high visibility She went on television to promote the idea that access to contraceptives is a womans right Her ministry where 120 people work in a grandly restored Paris building publishes a monthly magazine called Citizens in Every Sense With many photographs it closely chronicles her activities and initiatives The ministrys press service issued an information sheet on Mrs Roudy called The Exemplary Life of a SelfMade Woman It says she was born into a very modest family and knew class struggle before gender struggle Mrs Roudy has also recently published an autobiography called A Cause dElles loosely On Behalf of Women that recounts how she became a feminist leader Born in Pessac near Bordeaux she went to work at the age of 16 as a typist in a fish canning plant an experience she says was important in leading her to Socialism She married Pierre Roudy now the director of an acting school in Paris and a man who according to the books preface by Simone de Beauvoir was both older and far more cultivated than she Never Pulled Back In 1963 she founded a feminist organization called the Womens Democratic Movement which two years later became a part of the political machine being created by Mr Mitterrand In her preface to A Cause dElles Miss de Beauvoir calls Mrs Roudy a fighter who never pulled back from any danger Thats true I think yes Mrs Roudy said It seems that I do not become afraid You cant be fearful in politics you cant allow yourself to be intimidated And she went on you should never believe it when somebody tells you something is impossible You have to go to see yourself and to try yourself to make it possible
A FIRST-TERM LEGISLATOR LEARNS ROPES IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/01/nyregion/a-first-term-legislator-learns-ropes-in-albany.html,There are still signs that Catherine T Nolan is a novice when it comes to the business of legislating Her mother sometimes comes up from Queens to watch my daughter the legislator And when the Speaker bangs down his gavel calling the Assembly to order Catherine Nolan actually takes it seriously and sits down and stops talking But as her first legislative session as a Queens Assemblywoman was drawing to a close there were also signs that like many of the 20 other freshman lawmakers she was coming of age as a legislator A week ago Mrs Nolan made her first speech on the floor warning New York City officials not to weasel out of cleanair standards for resourcerecovery plants She introduced eight bills during the session six of which passed both houses And she has learned the secret of networking drawing on alliances offered by other women in the Legislature and by fellow lawmakers from Queens Finding Her Way In short Catherine Nolan is finding her way in this world of favors received and favors repaid I know Im only part of the parade said Mrs Nolan who is 27 years old Sometimes I feel like Im treading water here But then one of your bills passes I know theyre not big deals But its a nice feeling to see them become part of the law of New York State You listen you learn At 230 this morning she ws doing both Sitting in the middle of a chaotic Assembly as bill after bill was rushed to a vote Mrs Nolan jumped up from time to time to leadf through the pile of papers on her desk trying to figure out exactly what she was voting on Sometimes she succeeded sometime she did not Youre here six months already and you think youve caught on she said But things still slip by For guidance she has turned to the committee chairmen who like her are Democrats They tend to take Democratic freshmen under their wings finding out their special interests and steering the sponsorship of bills their way All eight bills sponsored by Mrs Nolan  mostly minor changes in administrative laws  were not her ideas but were referred to her with passage by the Assembly virtually assured That same advantage does not fall to freshman lawmakers of the minority party For example Daniel Frisa a Westbury LI Republican was not the prime sponsor of a single bill that passed Introducing Governors Bill Robach asked me if I wanted to carry a Governors program bill Mrs Nolan said referring to Roger J Robach a Democrat from Rochester and the chairman of the Commerce Committee on which she serves I said Sure  The bill proposed by Governor Cuomo would increase the amount of aid the Job Development Authority could lend businesses owned by women and members of minority groups It passed the Assembly last week by a vote of 148 to 1 While Mrs Nolan talked often of the guidance she received from the Assemblys Democratic leadership she said she had never been pressured to vote for or against a particular bill I havent got one call like that she said But she acknowledged that you pick up during party conferences the way the leaders would like to see things go And for the most part her votes have followed the party line Seeking Colleagues Guidance On what she called the moral issues such as the death penalty and abortion Mrs Nolan turns for guidance to Assembly members whose districts neighbor her own the 37th I feel theyve been here a number of years she said Im a little uncomfortable with all the moral issues In my neighborhood thats what all the churches and synagogues are for And she has been uncomfortable with some complicated issues as well preferring to stay in the background until she masters them In that she is heeding advice from Rosemary Gunning a former Queens Assemblywoman Whatever you do Mrs Nolan recalled Mrs Gunning as saying dont jump into housing until you know what youre doing because youll be eaten alive Searching for Prudent Course Im trying to take what I feel is the most prudent course Mrs Nolan went on Right now Im experiencing Im watching Next session Ill be more aggressive At times she seemed surprised by what she had found in Albany So many lobbyists so extremely knowledgeable But at other times she seemed not so much surprised as disappointed On a vote last week on a bill to outlaw discrimination in housing on the basis of sexual orientation Mrs Nolan decided to vote yes even though she knew the vote would not necessarily sit well with many voters in her district which is bluecollar and conservative According to fellow lawmakers she had hoped that Assemblyman Ivan C Lafayette who represents a neighboring district would also vote yes taking some of the political pressure off her But in the end the Assemblyman did not show up for the vote Some lawmakers said he had left the floor to avoid voting on a controversial issue Mr Lafayette said he was negotiating another bill and arrived on the floor literally three minutes too late In any case Mrs Nolan was left out on her own She declined to discuss the incident But she acknowledged that some of the moves made on the floor were eye opening Theres a whole ballet that goes on she said of the Legislature in general Im learning to dance
THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;   CHEESE MICROBE UNDERSCORES MYSTERY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/science/the-doctor-s-world-cheese-microbe-underscores-mystery.html,AT least 43 people died recently after eating a Mexicanstyle cheese containing the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes one of the most mysterious of all microbes The outbreak primarily affected California residents and is still under investigation It highlights how much even the most sophisticated doctors have yet to learn about this microbe and all the others that cause the myriad infectious diseases Many experts mistakenly believed that infectious diseases would no longer be important after the advent of antibiotics and immunizations Listeria monocytogenes was discovered 59 years ago and is found throughout the world except in the Antarctic in soil water and dust and many domestic and wild animals Yet doctors still know very little about how the bacterium is spread and why the disease it produces listeriosis strikes some people while sparing many others Listeria monocytogenes is a hardy organism that can persist for long periods and that has been isolated from many mammals birds ticks crustaceans dust stream water mud and sewage Doctors have found the organism in the feces of about one percent of the general population and in 5 percent of slaughterhouse workers and in 26 percent of those who had contact with listeriosis patients Yet researchers do not know why many people can harbor listeria and other organisms as carriers without becoming ill Nor do scientists know why most reported cases of listeriosis occur among city dwellers who have had no contact with animals and why the season of highest incidence seems to be from January to May in animals and from July to August in humans in the Northern Hemisphere What is known is that the listeria bacterium can produce abortions stillbirths meningitis and a wide variety of other problems The bacteria has been regarded as a rare cause of human illness with most cases occurring sporadically but many others resulting from small outbreaks There is no mandatory reporting of listeriosis in the United States Practicing doctors voluntarily report about 1000 cases of the disease to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta each year and in most cases epidemiologists cannot determine the source of the infection However some outbreaks have been traced to contamination in foods such as cole slaw and pasteurized milk In reporting a recent outbreak of listeriosis involving 49 people in Massachusetts Federal epidemiologists raised questions about the ability of pasteurization even when properly carried out to kill a large number of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria in contaminated raw milk That outbreak spurred the officials at the Federal disease centers and the Food and Drug Administration to more actively investigate the chances of dangerous organisms surviving the pasteurization process In the California outbreak there have been conflicting reports about the adequacy of the pasteurization At first California health officials said they had not found fault with Jalisco Mexican Products in Artesia Calif the manufacturer of the suspect cheese Later health officials said pasteurized milk might have been diluted with nonpasteurized milk The heating process that Louis Pasteur invented in the 1860s to improve beer and wine production and that was subsequently applied to the milk industry has probably saved as many lives as any other public health measure Thus it may come as a shock to many people that on rare occasions pasteurized milk products can be harmful even lethal Although pasteurized milk rarely is related to outbreaks of infection among humans the one in Massachusetts was a reminder that pasteurization is no guarantee against disease Pasteurization is not as many people mistakenly believe synonymous with sterilization Pasteurization is a technique that selectively kills dangerous bacteria without destroying many others that are considered harmless Nevertheless bacteria vary in their susceptibility to pasteurization and listeria are less susceptible to heat than many other diseasecausing microbes There are three general ways that milk can be contaminated A cow infected with listeria or other microorganisms may deliver contaminated milk Or if the cow has infected teats the milk may be delivered sterile but becomes contaminated as a result of a milkers handling of the infected teats Finally contamination may occur at any point from the time it is pasteurized to the time it is drunk In general the more organisms present in raw milk the more will be left after pasteurization Health officials usually rely on the number of coliform bacteria as a more accurate indicator of the degree of contamination than the total number of bacteria present For human consumption usually there must be fewer than 10 coliforms per milliliter in three or four samples of milk However health inspectors apply other tests to measure the effectiveness of pasteurization Listeria monocytogenes was first isolated in 1926 by three scientists at Cambridge University in England who found it in an epidemic among rabbits and guinea pigs and who called it Bacterium monocytogenes It was then called Tiger River Disease by researchers who reported an outbreak among gerbils at the South African Institute for Medical Research in Johannesburg Undoubtedly the organism was isolated from human patients in the years before but called by different names The name of the bacterium was changed to its present form by 1940 after a scientific meeting in New York The second word of its name is derived from the fact that these microbes sometimes lead to an increase in the number of a specific type of white blood cell called the monocyte Over the years doctors have found that the bacterium tends to strike adults who are pregnant or whose immune systems have been suppressed by drugs or disease It also has a marked affinity for shielded organs such as the central nervous system and the placenta Undoubtedly cases of listeriosis go undetected because doctors do not consider the possibility of the diagnosis often enough And even when they do think about it the diagnosis is sometimes missed because the untrained eye may confuse the small roundshaped listeria bacteria with others such as the pneumococci that cause one form of pneumonia as well as with other organisms such as streptococci and diphtheroids Further even when cases are properly diagnosed in several hospitals the occurrence of three or four cases instead of the usual one may not raise eyebrows Also even if doctors are suspicious it may be extremely difficult for epidemiologists to link them to a food or other common source The Mexicancheese outbreak might have gone undetected if doctors at the Los Angeles County Hospital had not noticed that a disproportionate number of Hispanic patients were affected Clearly doctors have much to learn about the nature of listeria and many other microbes before they can develop effective preventive measures and understand one of the biggest mysteries of infectious diseases Why they have a predilection for some individuals and spare many others
THE STAGE: THREE PLAYS IN WEST END,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/theater/the-stage-three-plays-in-west-end.html,Like Broadway the West End is longer on fluff especially American musical fluff than serious drama this summer Fifteen months after its opening Michael Frayns Benefactors remains unchallenged as the London commercial theaters most highly regarded new drama But if Waste the best play Ive seen in the West End since Benefactors is not exactly new it might as well be Written by Harley Granville Barker in 1907 and promptly banned Waste has rarely been seen anywhere since its belated London premiere in 1936 In its current Shaftesbury Avenue revival which originated at the Royal Shakespeare Company last winter the play seems a completely contemporary portrait of needlessly wasted public and private lives Granville Barker 18771946 is best known today for his Prefaces to Shakespeare still as lively as any theater criticism in the language But he was a Renaissance theater man who among many other achievements performed leading roles for his friend George Bernard Shaw At the original reading of Waste the cast included Shaw John Galsworthy H G Wells William Archer and Gilbert Murray Such illustrious partisans were of no use however once Londons Lord Chamberlain decided that a play featuring an abortion was unsuitable for public performance That abortion is central to Granville Barkers plot which tells of a promising political reformer Daniel Massey brought to ruin by his casual scandalous affair with a married woman Judi Dench Although moral hypocrisy and the sexual subjugation of women are subsidiary themes Waste is at its most extraordinary when examining the cynical machinations of backroom politics Once a Tory shadow cabinet gathers in a smokefilled London study to decide the protagonists fate Granville Barker dramatizes the sophisticated nuances of duplicitous governmental horsetrading as cleverly as any writer Ive ever encountered The scene is dominated by a softspoken yet wily former Prime Minister whose every statesmanlike phrase has at least three encoded meanings As played with silken ruthlessness by Tony Church this Edwardian pol could have taught Richard Nixon a trick or two While the play glistens with aphorisms as dry as gin Life for its own sake is an overrated thing it achieves a devastating finale once Mr Massey discovers that he lacks the interior resources to cope with the collapse of his utopian public ambitions The production directed by John Barton induces the heady feeling that Waste could have been a collaboration between Ibsen and Shaw In addition to the stars the 15member company includes such RSC stalwarts as Sara Kestelman Charles Kay David Waller and Eileen Page Visitors to London should note that Waste ends its limited run on July 27 Two Into One one of the West Ends few new commercial hits also deals with an adulterous Tory politician  and stars another RSC veteran Michael Williams who happens to be Miss Denchs husband But any similarities between this play and Granville Barkers are coincidental Two Into One is a stateofthecraft sex farce written and directed by Ray Cooney the locally beloved author of Not Now Darling and the longrunning Run for Your Wife With its seven slamming doors and countless mistaken identities the show often resembles Nothing On the parodistic farcewithinthefarce of Mr Frayns Noises Off London critics likened Two Into One to Feydeau when it opened last fall and perhaps it has declined with the departure of most of its original cast I saw an understudy in the key role of the philandering Home Office minister which was originated by Donald Sinden As the ministers private secretary a prissy bureaucrat soon forced to dive into the illicit coital shenanigans the frazzled Mr Williams looks like the canary who swallowed the cat Mr Cooneys script is a mixture of hoary doubleentendres When it comes to pornography everyone wants to take up a position and ingenious mechanics At the nastily funny Act I curtain the ultimate indignity befalls the minister and his wife  they accidentally find themselves in bed with each other rather than their respective lovers American audiences may well be startled by the antideluvian sexual manners of Two Into One not to mention its caricaturizations of homosexuals and a nospeakEnglish Chinese waiter played by an Occidental actor No less silly or sociologically antiquated is the seasons latest smash musical a revised revival of Me and My Girl a 1937 London hit with a Noel Gay score and a Douglas FurberL Arthur Rose libretto A Cinderella tale about a cockney revealed to be a longlost Earl the show reeks of class snobbery and is virtually indistinguishable from such warhorse English musicals as Charlie Girl and Mr Cinders Although the director Mike Ockrents lavish and overpopulated production at the Adelphi seems a hamfisted attempt at Hello Dolly the evening has its small charms Most of them are attributable to the leading man Robert Lindsay Previously known only as a serious actor  he was Edmund in Laurence Oliviers television King Lear  this young performer proves an acrobatic clown and impeccably stylish songanddance man He also provides a saving acidic edge to highly corny material As insolent as Harold Lang and as buoyant as Jim Dale Mr Lindsay would be the Pal Joey of anyones dreams So versatile is this actor that two days after seeing Me and My Girl it took me 10 minutes to recognize him when he appeared at the National Theater as a partner to the playwright Peter Nichols in an afternoon public reading Effortlessly impersonating a wild variety of comic characters in Mr Nicholss autobiography Mr Lindsay seemed unlikely to remain contained by Me and My Girl  or Londons

AROUND THE NATION;   Abortion Clinic Blasts Bring 10-Year Sentence,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/03/us/around-the-nation-abortion-clinic-blasts-bring-10-year-sentence.html,Calling the bombing of abortion clinics cowardly and vicious a Federal district judge today sentenced a lay minister to 10 years in prison for conspiring to bomb 10 clinics or offices of abortion supporters in three states and the District of Columbia The convict Michael D Bray 33 years old who is a house painter and lay copastor at the Grace Reformation Lutheran Church in Bowie Md was also ordered to pay more than 43000 in restitution The authorities said the bombings caused more than 1 million in property damage Bombings of this sort are among the most cowardly and vicious of all criminal acts said Judge Alexander Harvey 2d Mr Bray apologized for his involvement in the bombings and told the court he had respect for the law and Judge Harveys authority
MORE MARRIED WOMEN CHOOSING STERILIZATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/05/us/more-married-women-choosing-sterilization.html,Seven years ago when JoEllen Mayes was 36 years old and her husband Gordon was 44 they had a terrible fright Mrs Mayes thought she might be pregnant It was a false alarm but the idea of a second family as Mr Mayes put it when their two daughters were nearly grown and their mortgage was almost paid upset them so much that Mr Mayes had a vasectomy The Mayeses who live in Los Angeles thus joined an increasing number of Americans choosing sterilization It was such an enormous relief for both of us Mrs Mayes said especially when I had visions of another decade of PTA and Girl Scouts In 1983 the last year for which statistics were available 622000 women and 455000 men were sterilized as a contraceptive measure according to the Association for Voluntary Sterilization a private educational and research center in New York According to the most recent survey of the National Center for Health Statistics a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services the use of sterilization by married men and women has risen dramatically since 1965 In fact the survey concluded sterilization has replaced the birthcontrol pill as the most popular form of contraception for married women In 1965 7 percent of married women had had sterilization operations a tubal ligation By 1982 when the latest survey was conducted 26 percent had been sterilized At the same time the use of the pill among married women was on the wane going from 24 percent in 1965 to a peak of 36 percent in 1973 to 20 percent in 1982 Of the 7969 women interviewed for the survey 3551 were married 1100 were widowed divorced or separated and 3318 had never married The margin of sampling error for married women is plus or minus two percentage points for smaller groups within the survey the margin is larger According to the survey 5 percent of married men had been sterilized in 1965 as against 15 percent in 1982 Couples With Children The 1982 survey was based on interviews with a representative sample of 7969 women 15 to 44 years old who were asked about family size their intention to have children and the means of contraception they or their sexual partners used The greatest increase in the use of sterilization female or male has occurred among couples with at least one child and in which the wife is 35 to 44 years old It seems to be a major form of birth control for the married middle class said Dr John J Barton chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center here in Chicago A Matter of Planning H Theodore Groat a sociology professor who studies fertility control at the Population and Society Research Center at Bowling Green State University in Ohio said it was now common for newly married young couples to consider sterilization as a future option The planning for their lives is such today that unless they can plan their fertility as well the plans for other aspects of their lives get knocked out of kilter he said Among unmarried younger women the pill remains the overwhelming choice according to Dr Louise B Tyrer vice president for medical affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America But sterilization is being utilized by women younger than ever before she said An analysis of hospital records conducted by the Centers for Disease Control demonstrates this In the period 1970 to 1980 the analysis showed 17 percent of the tubal ligations were performed on women under 25 According to Dr Nancy Lee an epidemiologist in the Federal centers reproductive health division this same review of hospital records showed that in 1979 and again in 1980 about half the tubal ligations were performed on women under 30 This included women who were sterilized for contraceptive or other reasons and the vast majority of them Dr Lee said had had children Antichild Posture Seen Professor Groat attributes this trend to the devaluation of fertility the devaluation of children as important in ones life The whole fertility revolution he said has to do with an almost antichild posture The popularity of sterilization has risen as medical procedures have become simpler For men the vasectomy has long been a minor operation in which ducts that carry sperm are blocked to prevent the sperm from mixing with semen it is performed under local anesthesia usually in a doctors office For women a tubal ligation involves cutting and tying the Fallopian tubes which carry the eggs to the uterus Until the development in the early 1970s of the technique of laparoscopy which involves inserting a scope through a tiny abdominal incision a tubal ligation required several days of hospitalization Now a woman typically has the surgery in a hospital on a Friday morning goes home a couple of hours later rests over the weekend and returns to work on Monday As medical advances were being made other factors were making sterilization more attractive Among them were rising fears about the safety of the pill and the intrauterine device Citing other factors Miriam Ruben spokesman for the Association for Voluntary Sterilization suggested that the influence of the womens movement shares equal billing with the economic concerns of today Better for the Whole Family After Angela and Alfred Cardenas of Long Beach Calif had their third child Mrs Cardenas a receptionist was sterilized She and her husband a director of security for a manufacturing firm had decided that if they were going to be able to afford a house they would have to limit the size of their family This way its better for the whole family Mrs Cardenas said Other couples have decided that children simply do not fit into their lives Bobbie Duff who is an administrative assistant to Dr Barton at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center knew seven years ago that neither she nor her husband wanted children I firmly believe that women belong at home with them and I was not willing to make that sacrifice she said Rather than continue to use the pill Mrs Duff now 36 said she decided it would be silly not to do something permanent She chose sterilization For years some states made voluntary sterilization a felony But even where there were no legal restrictions many hospitals required a committees approval before a tubal ligation could be performed That began to change in 1969 when the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the decision should be made by the patient and the physician not by committees The Critical Question Now men and women receive counseling but when a physician is convinced that their decision is an informed one the inquiry ends The critical question is Can you look me in the eye and say you would never want to bear a child again said Dr Robert S Neuwkirth director of obstetrics and gynecology at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital in New York Beverly and LeRoy Yates of Chicago made that decision 10 years ago after they had their fifth child Mrs Yates expressed no regrets but observed There are people who have hangups about their own selfworth when they cant reproduce I had those feelings as well she said but I told myself that this was a phase of my life that was over Despite the operation pregnancies still occur in 4 out of 1000 cases as Evelyn Robinson of Park Forest Ill discovered The mere thought of surgery was enough to frighten her but after their third child was born Mrs Robinson and her husband James decided that we really couldnt afford to have any more Mr Robinson who is now 47 chickened out his wife said so she went ahead with the surgery in December 1979 after changing her mind several times Less than a year later she was pregnant Abortion Not an Option She recalled I think I ran the gamut from disbelief to anger to finally acceptance Abortion was not really an option for me since I feel so strongly against it There were complications that nearly cost Mrs Robinson her life But she had the baby and a second tubal ligation in April 1981 Of the child named Kathy Mrs Robinson said Shes been a delight so how angry can I be Some parents become so angry because of a pregnancy following a sterilization procedure that they sue the doctors for wrongful life New York States highest court the Court of Appeals ruled in March that Brian and Susanne OToole of Queens were not entitled to childrearing expenses from two doctors who performed an unsuccessful tubal ligation on Mrs OToole several months before she became pregnant Other state courts have made similar rulings although some have allowed parents to recover actual medical expenses involved in the pregnancy and damages based on the shock and suffering brought about by learning of the pregnancy Despite the increasing acceptance of sterilization familyplanning professionals noted many men still shy away from vasectomies Cost a Factor for Some Theres something in the back of the male psyche that rebels against having their manhood tinkered with Dr Barton said Among blacks according to several experts vasectomies are very rare among whites men are sterilized nearly as often as women are There was a brief decline in vasectomies in the late 1970s after studies suggested a link between male sterilization and the risk of heart attacks Later studies indicated no such link and vasectomies have been on the increase Because of the cost in some couples the man rather than the woman is sterilized The price of a vasectomy generally runs from 200 to 500 a tubal ligation can be as much as 1500 Harold Link a 35yearold engineer in Evergreen Colo had a vasectomy because he felt it would be a bit safer than a tubal ligation would be for his wife Pam He went ahead with it after they had their second child Mrs Link who is also 35 also had three children from a previous marriage She recalled that after her first marriage she considered sterilization but decided against it when a gynecologist suggested that she might remarry and want to have more children Six months later I met Hal and we decided to marry she said so I was happy that the woman had talked me out of sterilization
GAPS IN MATERNITY INSURANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/05/style/gaps-in-maternity-insurance.html,Although the cost of giving birth has reached an average of 3200 for a normal delivery and thousands more when there are complications significant numbers of American women have either no insurance or inadequate insurance to cover those fees According to a report entitled Paying for Maternity Care and issued this week by the Alan Guttmacher Institute two categories of women  the young and the poor are particularly likely to be left out of the healthinsurance system despite the growth of both private and public coverage More than 25 percent of women in the primary childbearing age range of 18 to 24 who account for 40 percent of all births in this country annually have no healthcare coverage and consequently are unlikely to receive adequate medical attention All told 17 percent of women 15 to 44 years old have no form of health insurance The report a statistically oriented analysis based on data from the 1984 Current Population Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau was written by Rachel Benson Gold associate for policy analysis and Asta M Kenney associate for policy development at the institute The report designed to study gaps in the insurance system said Desite various public and private sources of coverage not all pregnant women have access to them In particular it singled out the groups most likely to be left out the young the poor the minorities the unmarried and those employed in certain jobs such as household services and retail industries The report studied both private insurance which covers 77 percent of women ages 15 to 44 and which is most commonly provided by group policies obtained through employers and publicly funded programs such as Medicaid A joint Federal and state program Medicaid covers 9 percent of women in the childbearing age range with 3 percent included in the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services a Federal program for military dependents But despite the availability of public funds  Medicaid has not been subject to budget cuts and through several policy changes has broadened the availability to pregnant women  for one reason or another large numbers of poor women do not fall under its umbrella Miss Kenney coauthor of the report said in a telephone interview People often have the impression that if youre sufficiently poor you have adequate healthcare coverage This study shows that only 4 out of 10 women at or below the Federal poverty level have Medicaid coverage According to the study Medicaid covers only 42 percent of women in the reproductive years whose annual family incomes are below 5000 and only 30 percent of those with incomes between 5000 and 10000 States Eligibility Requirements The others are left out Miss Kenney said generally because states have great flexibility in determining eligibility and 23 states have set the cutoff at half the Federal poverty level or 5000 a year Although they are rarely selfsufficient pregnant teenagers face special problems in obtaining Medicaid coverage Women younger than 18 who live in households receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children a requirement for Medicaid are covered But many teenagers try to hide their pregnancies from their families and thus will not use their parents Medicaid identification as required by physicians and clinics Teenagers living in homes not receiving AFDC must generally set up their own households to receive prenatal care under Medicaid Among the other categories of women who are insufficiently covered the report said while 15 percent of all white women have no protection against medical expenses the figure is 23 percent for blacks and 26 percent for Hispanics And it said Unmarried women are two to three times more likely than married women to be without coverage Twenty percent of all births in this country it said are to divorced separated or nevermarried women According to the study qualifying for Medicaid appears to be only the first obstacle finding a physician who accepts such reimbursement is the second The report said about half of the obstetricians and gynecologists are believed to turn away Medicaid patients mainly because the program reimburses only half the average fee and physicians are prohibited from passing on the difference to patients Limitations on what services are covered by Medicaid can pose additional obstacles We looked at whether those 4 out of 10 women who were eligible for Medicaid were receiving adequate care and we found that many states have limits on benefits Miss Kenney said For example a number of states limit the number of visits an individual can make to 10 or 12 a year A complicated pregnancy requires more visits and poor women are more likely to be highrisk patients The report marks the beginning of a new direction for the research and educational institute whose work in the past has been primarily focused on birth control and abortion A spokesman said Our board felt that we nave never concentrated on helping people have the babies they want It is as important to help women have the children they want under the best possible circumstances as it is to help them avoid the births they dont want
FROM MINORITY ACTIVIST TO FEMINIST LEADER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/06/style/from-minority-activist-to-feminist-leader.html,Ask Irene Natividad to describe herself and she responds without hesitation I am a professional woman a young woman a minority woman a mother and a volunteer Now she is also the chairman of the National Womens Political Caucus which means that for the next two years she will hold one of the most influential positions in the feminist movement Miss Natividad a 36yearold educator was elected to head the 77000member organization at its convention in Atlanta last weekend becoming its first AsianAmerican chairman The caucus with branches in 43 states works to put women in political office In an interview in the West Side apartment she shares with her husband Andrea Cortese and their 6monthold son Carlo Miss Natividad was asked why she had chosen to invest her energies in the womens caucus Because it became obvious to me that political power is the road to equality she responded Every aspect of our lives  from the rights of equal access to the preservatives in our food  is impacted on by legislation that is initiated discussed and voted on by white males in Washington or Albany Born in the Philippines Equally important to Miss Natividad a native of the Philippines is the cause of AsianAmericans Indeed it was through the New York AsianPacific Womens Political Caucus that she became involved with the organization she now leads She has also helped form other groups among them the AsianAmerican Professional Women and the National Network of AsianPacific American Women She was the AsianAmerican liaison to Geraldine A Ferraros campaign for Vice President last fall People of Asian descent identified strongly with the campaign she said because they had something at stake having the daughter of an immigrant win the nomination in particular one whose mother had sewn beads to send her kid to college As a whole AsianAmericans are late to the political arena she said giving her son a bottle They tried to make it in the economic arena first As deputy vice chairman of the Asian caucus in the Democratic National Committee a major project in which I was involved was to create Asian caucuses in each state We did it in 22 states with no specific goals other than becoming enmeshed in the political process But she does not want the National Womens Political Caucus to stress the interests of any single group of women She said she was taken aback by advice before her campaign for the chairmanship that this was not the right time for the caucus to have a minority chairman People focused on my minority status she said For me my biggest advantage was my experience She won 312 votes to 262 over Linda Hallenborg an Atlanta businesswoman Miss Natividad is one of four children of a chemical engineer and a homemaker She lived in the Philippines until she was 5 years old when the family moved because of her fathers job first to Okinawa then to Iran and India among other places She speaks Italian Spanish French Tagalog a language of the Philippines and a little Greek and Farsi I was educated mainly in schools for international children run by Americans and my father worked for American firms so I have always had a cultural affinity with Americans she said That affinity and a desire to partake of the culture of New York brought her to Long Island University where she was valedictorian of the class of 1971 She pursued a PhD in early American literature at Columbia University choosing the narratives of slave women as a topic for her dissertation which she has not yet completed I had trouble getting that topic approved she said The narratives were not considered to be literature and to choose only women compounded it When she announced her intention to marry Mr Cortese 11 years ago her mother who now lives in Ottawa responded But you cant do that  you dont have your PhD yet And she didnt want to come to my college graduation unless I was valedictorian Miss Natividad said Her familys expectations had no limits she recalled She taught composition and literature for three years at Columbia and at Herbert H Lehman College of the City University of New York but was drawn from the classroom into the administration of continuing education She is now on leave as director of the Center for Continuing Education at William Paterson College in Wayne NJ Continuing education is an issue that arouses her feminist sensibilities It is still the stepchild of academia she said Colleges are still geared to 18 to 24yearold males but the overwhelming majority of continuingeducation students are women But she has reservations about the value of returning to school for some women So many are coming back for degrees or additional training out of insecurity she said They simply feel they need more paper when what they probably need more is to learn how to manuever within the structure Nevertheless she is proud that she developed the program at William Paterson College from a few courses to a major center with 3000 students Wants Broader Representation in Caucus Miss Natividads campaign slogan for the caucus race was A national leader for a national movement In her new position she has clear goals among them to broaden the membership Like the rest of the womens movement she said our profile is white age 30 and older middle or upperclass and highly educated I want to expand to include more Republican women more younger women who feel they dont need us older women who feel weve left them behind women of color and professional women who feel that they advanced on their own without help The primary issues on which the organization will lobby she said are abortion rights and pay equity To those who suggest that the womens movement has gone into the doldrums Miss Natividad rattles off statistics and says Look where we are today The local level is critical in order to create a pool of national candidates and in state governments we have 18 women Secretaries of State up from 9 a decade ago We have 1096 women state legislators compared to 771 14 years ago Last week an allfemale City Council was elected in Missoula Mont Does this look like a movement thats on hold or being eroded
RULINGS OF HIGH COURT'S TERM REAFFIRM CHURCH-STATE BARRIERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/08/us/rulings-of-high-court-s-term-reaffirm-church-state-barriers.html,The Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed its traditional insistence on the separation of church and state in the term that ended last week The term confounded widespread expectations based on several recent decisions that the Court was about to relax substantially the constitutional barriers between religion and government Instead the Court handed down four decisions in the past month that reinforced beyond argument the principle that government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion the words the majority used in striking down an Alabama law that set aside a moment for silent prayer in the public schools Setback for Administration The development was a sharp setback for the Reagan Administration which had entered all four cases in an effort to persuade the Court that government should not only be more hospitable toward religious exercise but should also accord religion a special status deserving of more protection than other activities The Administration made this argument most explicitly in defense of a Connecticut law that gave employees an unqualified right to a weekly day off for religious observance but not for other purposes The Court declared the law unconstitutional by a vote of 8 to 1 in an opinion by Chief Justice Warren E Burger In two other cases the Court declared unconstitutional two programs in which public school systems sent teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial instruction and other courses The Court said the programs in New York City and Grand Rapids Mich forged an impermissible symbolic union of government and religion Limits to Accommodation Only a year earlier the Court had appeared to signal a shift on churchstate law in upholding the display of a Nativity scene as part of a municipal Christmas celebration in Pawtucket RI Chief Justice Burger wrote that opinion framing the issue in terms that cheered those who were hoping for a new approach from the Court The Constitution he declared affirmatively mandates accommodation not merely tolerance of all religions But the opinions this year far from embracing the notion of accommodation placed strict limits on that concept As a result last years creche decision which so recently looked like a constitutional watershed now appears to be a dead end The religion cases all but overshadowed the other major development of the term The Court overruled a nineyearold precedent under which state governments were deemed immune from various forms of Federal regulation In February the Court ruled that state and local governments must pay their employees according to Federal minimum wage and hour standards The 5to4 decision was a strong blow to advocates of states rights sweeping away the constitutuional underpinnings of the new federalism In most other respects the term that began Oct 1 and ended July 2 was a quiet one In contrast to the preceding term there were relatively few cases on the docket dealing with either discrimination or criminal law While several decisions a year ago placed new limits on the rights of criminal defendants and prison inmates the Court this term made little new law on those subjects Defendants in fact fared rather well in several cases 59 Opinions With No Dissent Of the 139 signed opinions 59 were decided without a dissenting vote and 19 were decided by a onevote margin either 5to4 or 4to3 By contrast 26 cases last year and 32 the year before were decided by onevote margins Several potentially important cases ended up being decided on narrow grounds or not being decided at all Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr missed more than two months of the term recuperating from surgery for prostate cancer Eight cases argued in his absence eventually ended in tie votes In that circumstance the Court writes no opinion and the 4to4 vote while affirming the ruling of the lower court sets no precedent Justice Powells key role as a centrist on an ideologically polarized Court was apparent in other ways as well He cast only six dissenting votes all term a strikingly low number indicating that the side on which Justice Powell chose to cast his vote almost always prevailed He voted with the winning side in 13 of the 17 5to4 cases in which he participated In 12 of those 13 cases Chief Justice Burger and Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr leader of the Courts liberal wing were on opposite sides Justice Powell voted seven times with the Chief Justice and five times with Justice Brennan Brennan Cast Most Dissents Justice Brennan cast the highest number of dissenting votes 41 followed by his close ally Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall with 40 Associate Justice John Paul Stevens cast 36 dissenting votes and appeared to solidify his status as a loner on the Court Justices are content most of the time to join someone elses dissenting opinion saving most of their energy for the cases in which they are writing the majority opinion But Justice Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion explaining his own often distinctive point of view in 30 of the 36 cases Justice Brennan had the next highest number of written dissents 19 There were 13 decisions from which only one Justice dissented Justice Stevens cast six of those dissenting votes Associate Justice William H Rehnquist with a total of 25 dissenting votes was the lone dissenter in five cases Tracing the Voting Patterns One method admittedly imprecise of tracing voting patterns on the Court is to examine those cases that found Chief Justice Burger and Justice Brennan on opposite sides These are often the most important and politically charged cases The 56 such decisions this term included the parochial school and Alabama prayer cases the state immunity decision and a decision that labor unions may not discipline members who resign during a strike Not all Justices participated in all 56 cases Justice Rehnquist voted with the Chief Justice in 51 of these decisions and with Justice Brennan in three By contrast Justice Marshall voted with the Chief Justice in two and with Justice Brennan in 53 The rest of the Court was somewhere in between Associate Justice Byron R White voted with Chief Justice Burger in 47 cases and with Justice Brennan in nine for years Justice White was regarded as casting a swing vote but now is a predictable member of the conservative bloc For Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor the figures were an almost identical 46 and eight Justice Powell voted 31 times with the Chief Justice and 12 with Justice Brennan Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun split his votes almost evenly 28 with the Chief Justice and 25 with Justice Brennan Justice Stevens voted 20 times with Chief Justice Burger and 35 with Justice Brennan Victories for Brennan The term was something of a triumph for Justice Brennan despite his large number of dissenting opinions At 79 and approaching his 29th Supreme Court term he is the Courts senior member in terms of both age and length of service Long considered a master of Court politics he engineered victories in the cases he cared most about the parochial school decisions which he wrote and the state immunity decision which he assigned to Justice Blackmun but for which he spent years laying the groundwork Despite the expectations voiced often in last years Presidential campaign that there would soon be a number of vacancies on the Court there was no indication of any retirement plans as the term ended A crowded docket for the next term which begins Oct 7 includes more religion cases as well as cases on abortion and affirmative action Following are summaries of some of the Courts most important rulings this year Religion In striking down the Alabama law providing for a moment of silent prayer or meditation at the start of the school day the Court took the state at its word that the purpose of the statute was to bring prayer back into the classroom and found that purpose unconstitutional by a vote of 6 to 3 The decision Wallace v Jaffree No 83812 does not necessarily invalidate all such laws States that can defend their moment of silence laws as having a secular purpose such as bringing a sense of order to the classroom rather than making prayer the favored activity may ultimately prevail In declaring unconstitutional the Connecticut law that gave employees an unqualified right not to work on their chosen Sabbath Chief Justice Burger said the law impermissibly elevated religious reasons for not wanting to work on a given day above all other reasons Thornton v Caldor No 831158 The Court ruled that public school systems may not send teachers into parochial school classrooms to provide remedial or enrichment instruction Twin 5to4 decisions struck down programs in Grand Rapids and New York City New York channeled Federal funds to educationally deprived children its program was a model for hundreds of others around the country A 32 billion Federal program Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will have to be substantially redesigned if the special services are to reach children in parochial schools Grand Rapids v Ball No 83990 and Aguilar v Felton No 84237 Religious organizations that run commercial enterprises must pay the minimum wage the Court ruled in upholding a Labor Department enforcement action against an evangelical Christian group Alamo Foundation v Secy of Labor No 831935 Criminal Law The Court ruled that public school officials may search students as long as there are reasonable grounds for believing the search will yield evidence of a violation of the law or school rules The Court rejected the argument that the Constitution does not apply at all to searches of students on school property On the other hand the Court said the standard of probable cause generally required for police searches need not be met in the school context New Jersey v TLO 83712 For the first time the Court ruled that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal Evitts v Lucey No 831378 In the terms major death penalty ruling the Court made it easier for the prosecution to remove potential jurors with doubts about capital punishment from murder trials that could result in a death sentence Wainwright v Witt No 841427 The Court ruled that a state must provide an indigent criminal defendant who wishes to plead insanity with free psychiatric assistance in preparing such a defense Ake v Okla No 835424 The Court ruled that the police may not shoot to kill a fleeing criminal suspect who is neither armed nor dangerous Tenn v Garner No 831035 The Court ruled that a Government policy of singling out for prosecution only avowed resisters to the draft registration law did not amount to unconstitutional selective prosecution The Court said the young men in effect selected themselves for prosecution Wayte v US No 831292 Federal Authority The Court ruled that state and local governments are not immune from compliance with Federal wage and hour standards or by extension from most other forms of Federal regulation Garcia v San Antonio Metro No 821913 The Court ruled that Congress never authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission to block the publication of stock market newsletters on the basis of past misconduct by the newsletters publisher Lowe v SEC No 831911 The Court upheld a position of the Federal Reserve Board ruling in favor of regional banking zones The decision Northeast Bancorp v Board of Governors No 84363 was followed by a spate of interstate bank mergers The Court gave the Central Intelligence Agency increased discretion to withhold the identities of its sources of intelligence information from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act CIA v Sims No 831075 The Court ruled that the decision by a Federal agency not to take a particular enforcement action is generally beyond the scrutiny of the courts The decision Heckler v Chaney No 831878 backed the Food and Drug Administrations refusal to investigate the lethal drugs used for executions Labor In one of its most important rulings on the scope of the Federal law against age discrimination the Court ruled that airlines may not force flight engineers to retire at the age of 60 The decision Western Air Lines v Criswell No 831545 imposed a stringent standard on employers seeking exemptions from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The Court ruled that labor unions may not penalize members who resign during a strike The decision Pattern Makers v NLRB No 831894 held that unions violate the National Labor Relations Act by imposing fines on members who resign from the union and go back to work Speech and Press The Court struck down the 1000 legal limit on spending by political action committees on behalf of Presidential candidates in the general election The Court ruled that the limit part of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act violated the rights of free speech and association protected by the First Amendment Federal Election Commission v Natl Conservative PAC No 831032 The Court expanded the ability of lawyers to advertise ruling that the First Amendment gives lawyers the right to use printed advertising to seek clients for specific cases Zauderer v Office of Disciplinary Counsel No 832166 The Court ruled that the Nation magazine infringed the copyright on the memoirs of former President Gerald R Ford by printing unauthorized quotations from the book several weeks before its publication date in 1979 Harper  Row v The Nation No 831632 In an important libel ruling the Court made it easier for some individuals who are not public figures to recover damages for libel The Court said that when the libel in question involved a matter of only private interest rather than one of public concern a private plaintiff could recover punitive as well as compensatory damages without having to prove that the defendant knowingly or recklessly published a falsehood The decision left intact the requirement that public figures must prove knowing or reckless falsity to recover damages Dun  Bradstreet v Greenmoss No 8318 Other Decisions The Court refused to set limits on the use of the powerful Federal antiracketeering law as the basis for private lawsuits alleging ordinary business fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act enacted as a tool against organized crime is increasingly being used by companies to sue one another for securities fraud breach of contract and the like The Court said it was up to Congress not the courts to limit the law Sedima v Imrex No 84648 In one of the terms few decisions to interpret the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment the Court ruled that the Constitution does not give the

Too Many Mouths to Feed,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/10/opinion/too-many-mouths-to-feed.html,In many parts of the world death not birth control determines the size of a family When a country has too many mouths to feed its children are the first to die That is why the United States has long been committed to familyplanning programs overseas And one would assume that this commitment has been deepened by the famine in Ethiopia  the consequence of drought poor land use and overpopulation  and the probability of many more famines elsewhere It has and it hasnt Congress voted in the spring for the largest onetime increase in funding for overseas population programs But now that commitment has run afoul of legislators concerned about reports of forcible abortions in China Surely that concern can be acknowledged without sacrificing the commitment But that is not the way of Senator Jesse Helms His amendment to the foreign aid authorization bill denies all American support to all population agencies that work in any country said to permit coerced abortions  even if none of the agencies use Federal funds there Under that proposal the UN which works in China would lose American money even though no UN funds have ever been spent for abortionrelated activities Much more sensible is the approach of Senator Nancy Kassebaum Her proposal and Representative Olympia Snowes in the House would direct that no American money can go either directly or through other agencies to countries said to encourage coercive abortion What is or isnt happening in China remains a distressing question But it also has become a handy excuse for legislators who oppose voluntary abortion and sometimes all artificial contraception and who want to cripple American aid to family planning abroad Coercive abortion is an atrocity Larger atrocities may lie in store however if the world population continues to grow at its present rate
"MEESE, IN BAR GROUG SPEECH, CRITICIZES HIGH COURT",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/10/us/meese-in-bar-groug-speech-criticizes-high-court.html,Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said today that the framers of the Constitution would have found bizarre the Supreme Courts recent reaffirmation that the First Amendment requires government to maintain strict neutrality toward religion Far too many of the Courts opinions on the whole have been more policy choices than articulations of longterm constitutional principle he said in a speech before the American Bar Associations House of Delegates referring specifically to the High Courts decisions in cases involving religion federalism and criminal law in its 198485 term which ended last week The Attorney General said the Reagan Administration would urge the Court to follow a jurisprudence of original intention seeking to resurrect the original meaning of constitutional provisions rather than reading the policy preferences of the Justices into the Constitution Decision on Federalism Opposed Mr Meese chose the bar associations meeting here as the forum for his first major statement about the Supreme Court since he became Attorney General earlier this year He said the Court departed from basic principles of the Constitution involving federalism in a 5to4 decision last February that overruled a nineyearold precedent under which state governments were deemed immune from various forms of Federal regulation He also made clear his displeasure with the Courts rejection of the Administrations position in major cases this year involving school prayer government aid to religious schools and a law giving employees an absolute right to a day off to observe their Sabbath Praise Mixed With Criticism The Courts doctrine that the First Amendments clause on religion requires a strict neutrality between religion and nonreligion Mr Meese said would have struck the founding generation as somewhat bizarre Mr Meese spoke of the Court in a respectful tone however mixing criticism with praise of some of the Courts decisions especially those on issues involving criminal law While asserting that in many ways the Court remains the primary moral force in American politics he said it continues to roam at large in a veritable constitutional forest sometimes with utterly unpredictable results The Court is closely balanced now with liberal and conservative wings and a moderate center that often determines the outcome of cases It is widely thought that if one or two of the nine Justices retired President Reagan could produce a major shift in the Courts ideological balance by choosing successor who shared his conservative views Omissions From Prepared Text The Attorney General did not utter some of the more forceful criticisms contained in his prepared text a clear sign that he was not ready to attack the Court as emphatically as some of his aides and speechwriters would like For example the prepared text of Mr Meeses speech issued by the Justice Department said Nowhere else has the principle of federalism been dealt so politically violent and constitutionally suspect a blow as by the theory of incorporation This was a reference to a 60yearold series of decisions in which the Court has ruled that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights which originally applied only to the Federal Government were made applicable to the states as well by adoption of the 14th Amendment after the Civil War Mr Meese omitted from his speech this statement which would have suggested a desire to see dozens of important precedents overruled Asked afterward whether he questioned the Courts decisions incorporating provisions of the Bill of Rights against the states he replied that I do not have any particular quarrel at this stage of the game with what the Court has done on that issue Intentions of Framers Cited Rather he said the important point was to go back to the original intentions of the framers and that was I believe in religion cases to be sure that there was no preference given to any religion it was not to put religion on the same par constitutionally as nonreligion Legal experts disagree widely about the original intentions of the framers of the Constitution on many issues Generally speaking many liberals who favor the Courts decisions in recent decades prohibiting officially sanctioned prayer in public schools expanding the rights of criminal defendants and recognizing new rights such as a womans right to have an abortion argue that the framers included broad phrases in the Constitution with the intention that evolving societal standards be read into them by the Supreme Court Many conservatives read the Constitution more narrowly and literally The Attorney General also omitted from his speech a reference in his prepared text to the need to avoid a drift back toward the radical egalitarianism and expansive civil libertarianism of the Warren Court
COURT VOIDS ABORTION CURB IN JERSEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/11/nyregion/court-voids-abortion-curb-in-jersey.html,A Federal judge today voided a state rule requiring that abortions after the 16th week of pregnancy be performed in licensed hospitals and not in clinics The judge H Lee Sarokin of Federal District Court said the requirement was unconstitutional because it deprived some women of their right to abortion by considerably increasing the cost of the procedure He noted that United States Supreme Court rulings had stipulated that a state might not unreasonably burden a womans right to seek a secondtrimester abortion  one during the 13th to 24 week of pregnancy  by requiring that all such abortions be done in a hospital unless there was an overriding medical reason for so doing He said that while the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the safety and health of patients seeking abortions the conditions imposed must be such that they do not thwart the availability of lowcost abortions unless mandated by accepted and recognized medical standards Clearly Guaranteed Right Any distinction between abortions which may be performed in hospitals but not in nonhospital facilities must meet this test the judge added in a 26page opinion To permit otherwise would result in violation of the right to abortion now clearly guaranteed by decisions of the United States Supreme Court Judge Sarokin said that whatever standards made it appropriate to perform abortions in a hospital could be imposed in a clinic provided such conditions were consistent with present medical knowledge and practice He stayed his ruling for 90 days so the State Board of Medical Examiners could draft new regulations Thoman Cannon a spokesman for the State Attorney Generals office said no decision would be made on whether to appeal or draft new rules until the office had reviewed the ruling Difference in Fees Noted Judge Sarokin ruled in a case brought by the Pilgrim Medical Group of Montclair In court papers attorneys for the abortion clinic showed that an abortion at 18 weeks of gestation could cost about 1500 if performed in a hospital while a clinic fee would be about 495 It cannot be denied that given the price differential between secondtrimester abortions offered by plaintiff and those performed in hospitals many women and particularly poor women will forgo such abortions the exercise of their constitutional rights having been impermissibly chilled by the state regulation Judge Sarokin wrote The resulting harm is as irreparable as any that can be imagined not only does it flow from the deprivation of constitutional rights but it creates a situation which is irreversible and not compensable It renders preliminary injunctive relief appropriate and necessary

HOUSE ACTS TO ALLOW ANGOLA REBEL AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/11/world/house-acts-to-allow-angola-rebel-aid.html,The House of Representatives voted tonight to repeal the ban on United States military aid to the guerrillas fighting the Marxist Government of Angola The vote was 236 to 185 on an amendment to the foreign aid authorization bill The Senate has approved a similar repeal which means it is likely that the ban first approved in 1976 will be repealed this year But the Senate repeal was attached to a different piece of legislation the State Department authorization act and it is possible that the entire foreign aid authorization bill will not be approved in the House In the House vote 176 Republicans were joined by 60 Democrats in favor of repeal 179 Democrats and 6 Republicans opposed repeal The vote which is a major reversal reflects a growing sentiment in the House for aiding groups that are fighting Communist and other leftist governments On Tuesday the House approved 5 million in aid to the nonCommunist rebels fighting the Vietnamesecontrolled Government of Cambodia The House has also approved aid to the insurgents in Afghanistan and nonmilitary aid to Nicaraguan rebels The amendment approved today was proposed by Representatives Samuel S Stratton of New York and Claude Pepper of Florida both Democrats It only removes the ban it does not provide any financing for military aid Those supporting the amendment said it would show that the United States opposed Communism in Africa and as Mr Pepper said had not washed our hands of Angola Mr Pepper added Those people in Africa have the right to be free The Reagan Administration supports repeal Opponents argued that repealing the ban would indicate support for the apartheid policy of South Africa against which the House has approved economic sanctions In addition they argued it would imply support of the South African Governments military actions in SouthWest Africa and Angola Majority Rule Seen as Issue The issue in southern Africa is not Communist expansion its majority rule said Representative William H Gray 3d Democrat of Pennsylvania He said repealing the ban known as the Clark Amendment after former Senator Dick Clark of Iowa would support the continued suppression of the majority there The socalled Clark Amendment had banned aid to the proWestern National Union for the Total Independence of Angola which is led by Jonas Savimbi The vote came as the House continued work on the 126 billion foreign aid authorization bill At the same time the Senate began today to consider a bill imposing sanctions on the South African Government It was being blocked from moving to approval however by opposition led by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina Measures on Family Planning Earlier today the House approved two amendments to the foreign aid bill that restrict funding for family planning One allows the cutoff of funds to international organizations if abortion is promoted by the family planning programs these organizations support The second amendment which is aimed at China allows the cutoff of funding for the United Nations Fund for Populations Activities if it provides direct or indirect assistance to countries that officially permit forced abortion After the Senate voted 88 to 8 to block a filibuster on the motion to begin debate on the South African bill Senator Helms indicated that he might extend the debate by reading a history of South Africa The bill would apply economic sanctions against South Africa banning new bank loans the sale of computers to agencies like the police that enforce the policy of apartheid and the sale of goods used in nuclear production The bill would also require American companies of 25 or more employees to follow the socalled Sullivan principles which mandate equal treatment of blacks in jobs and housing Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California in denouncing Senator Helmss delaying tactics said If the Senator from North Carolina had been in the Senate 122 years ago he probably would have opposed Emancipation because it would have thrown four million slaves out of work
HOUSE APPROVES FOREIGN AID BILL OPPOSING MARXISTS AROUND WORLD,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/12/world/house-approves-foreign-aid-bill-opposing-marxists-around-world.html,The House passed a 126 billion foreign aid bill today that appears to reflect a growing determination on Capitol Hill to confront Communist and other leftist governments around the world The legislation authorizes new aid for rebels battling the Marxist Governments in Cambodia and Afghanistan and lifts a nineyear ban on American help to insurgent forces in Angola Last month the House reversed earlier votes and supported renewed aid to forces seeking to topple the leftist Government of Nicaragua Dont Want to Look Weak Vin Weber a Minnesota Republican summed up the mood by saying Members of Congress dont want to look weak right now Michael D Barnes a Maryland Democrat added Its sort of an angry mood around here Who can we stick it to next The bill was approved in a voice vote as lawmakers sought to avoid a recorded vote that could prove politically troublesome The Senate has already passed a 128 billion foreign aid bill and a conference will be needed to reconcile the two versions The action today means that Congress is now likely to approve its first foreign aid bill since 1981 In recent years such legislation was swamped by a number of emotional issues and Congress found it easier to finance foreign aid programs through catchall spending bills that avoided controversy Administration Opposes Bill However the Administration opposed the bill offered today raising the possibility that the President might veto whatever compromise emerges The White House said the measure placed too much emphasis on economic assistance and not enough on military aid In addition the Administration is incensed at a provision that would bar Jordan from receiving advanced weapons unless the President certifies that the Jordanian Government is ready to recognize Israel and enter peace negotiations with it The bill adopted today outlines 126 billion in foreign aid programs for the fiscal years 1986 and 1987 Appropriations in a later bill would be needed to finance those programs Conservative Support Many conservatives swung behind todays bill after several amendments were approved that moved the legislation toward the right Representative Weber a leading conservative voice in the House said of the bill Its a change in policy in the right direction Were really enunciating a Reagan doctrine in the Congress  that we will support resistance movements around the world Mr Weber also said that with Mr Reagan in the White House Republicans had a greater responsibility to support foreign aid A majority party he said cannot be an isolationist party Like Taking a Cast Off Conservatives said the most important provision lifted the ban on American aid to the Angolan rebels Known as the Clark Amendment the ban was adopted in 1976 and inaugurated a series of efforts by Congress in subsequent years to restrict the Administrations foreign policy flexibility Henry J Hyde an Illinois Republican said that canceling the amendment was like taking a cast off a broken leg He added It shows were no longer paralyzed by Vietnamguilt legislation Many liberals were deeply distressed by the repeal of the amendment which is named for former Senator Dick Clark Democrat of Iowa They saw it as part of a dangerous trend in the words of Thomas J Downey Democrat of Long Island that is leading toward a more aggressive foreign policy What this bill says is that the threat to use force is part and parcel of our diplomacy and I think thats a mistake Mr Downey said A number of liberals supported the bill however because it contained 45 billion for Israel that Howard L Berman a California Democrat described as critical assistance Mr Barnes noted that the bill also would renew restrictions on aid to El Salvador by requiring regular reports on its willingness to negotiate with guerrilla forces and protect human rights The bill would provide about 6 billion in military assistance almost 500 million less than the Administration requested Economic aid would be almost 4 billion with the rest going for development projects and international organizations The bill includes these provisions  Israel would receive 45 billion including an emergency infusion of 15 billion to help it survive its financial crisis Egypt is in line for 21 billion  A ban on recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization until it recognizes Israel would be reaffirmed  AntiCommunist rebels in Cambodia would get 5 million and another 15 million would aid Afghans resisting Soviet control  American aid for international family planning programs that promote abortion would be barred  Suspension of trade with Ethiopia would be allowed if the President determined that the Ethiopian Government was deliberately starving its people and if Congress passed a joint resolution The Administration argued that under the House bill deep cuts would be necessary in some of its Central American programs It also denounced the requirements for reporting on El Salvadors progress as onerous and contrary to US interests

NEW BATTLE AT FAMILY PLANNING OFFICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/13/us/new-battle-at-family-planning-office.html,Senator Jesse Helms has called it more damaging to American society than terrorism The head of the American Life Lobby the countrys most vocal antiabortion group says it has surely made teenagers more promiscuous And family planning lobbyists who see it as perhaps the best hope for reversing increases in teenage pregnancy are in a constant state of political red alert about even minute changes in its operation The object of this collective agitation is the Federal program that provides contraceptive services and counseling to lowincome women and teenagers Known in Washingtons bureaucratic shorthand as Title X it was created by Congress in 1970 as part of the Public Service Act is run by the Office of Family Planning of the Department of Health and Human Services and this year will funnel 1425 million to 4000 state local and privately operated family planning clinics around the country Ideological Battleground Since the start of the Reagan Administration management of the program and regulations on the use of its funds has been an especially hot ideological battleground in Congress the courts and within the Reagan Administration itself Earlier this year there was a brief truce between the forces for and against the right to abortion but the struggle is now heating up once again Family planning groups have found a new cause for alarm in the expected appointment of Gary E Crum to be new director of the program Mr Crum now an associate professor in the department of health services administration at George Washington University has a long background in public health policy and planning But what worries family planning groups is that he is also on the advisory board of the American Life Lobby which opposes any Federal role in family planning Affiliation with that organization indicates total antipathy to the very existence of the Title X program says Scott R Swirling director of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association which represents 80 percent of the organizations receiving Title X funds Mr Swirling said his group was concerned that the expected appointment was an attempt by the Administration to accomplish through bureaucratic fiat what it had been unable to accomplish through the courts and in Congress Mr Crum says that despite his involvement with the American Life Lobby he is in favor of family planning and if I do get the job I would follow the law as written by Congress He described his membership in the American Life Lobby as purely voluntary and advisory and added Ive agreed with them on some things and disagreed with them on others While he opposes abortion he said what Id advocate for personal morality may be different than what Id advocate for public policy Clinics receiving Title X funds are required to offer counseling and referral on abortions but are barred from using the Federal money to provide abortion services Many however provide abortion services with funds from other sources a situation that has left them open to challenge from abortion foes who see the separation as artificial At one point program officials attempted to require clinics to notify the parents when a teenager was given contraceptives This rule caused one of the programs greatest controversies and eventually was struck down by the courts According to the president of the American Life Lobby Judie A Brown Title X is a tool to brainwash adolescents and divorce them from parental authority Wed like to see it defunded she said I dont feel it has served any useful purpose except to create a lot of promiscuity No final decision has been made on Mr Crums appointment according to Jo Ann Gasper who took over in March as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services But he is under serious consideration she added Seeking Good Manager I do not engage in guilt by association Mrs Gasper said Im trying to find a good competent manager to run the Title X program and I have been unable to find anything in Mr Crums background where he is opposed to family planning He has not taken the position on it taken by the American Life Lobby Mrs Gasper has worked hard in her first months on the job to repair frayed relations with groups on both sides of the abortion issue and to eliminate administrative and political problems Family planning agencies who believe they were subjected to politically motivated financial audits and other harassment before her arrival credit Mrs Gasper with considerable progress But now they fear another administrative onslought on family planning with an appointment of Mr Crum They are losing and have constantly lost every battle to appease the right wing on family planning Mr Swirling said voicing his groups view of the Administrations approach to the issue We go to court and beat them and they cant get the program defunded in Congress They cant give the right wing what it wants So they give it this

CHINESE LIBERALISM GOES ONLY SO FAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/14/weekinreview/chinese-liberalism-goes-only-so-far.html,FOR all that is changing there is much to remind the outsider of the deeprooted differences that still separate China from the West Although Deng Xiaoping the senior leader is committed to rapid modernization he has cautioned visitors not to expect wholesale Westernization In its crudest terms this means that China would like the wealth and technology associated with Western systems but not their political and social culture The point was made afresh last week when the abortion issue arose again to trouble relations between Washington and Peking The Chinese have said repeatedly that they can never hope to pull the country out of its backwardness unless population growth is sharply trimmed They have imposed a limit of one child per family in all but exceptional cases a sacrifice that is probably as difficult for this childloving nation as any the Communists have demanded since they came to power in 1949 The United States had already made its objections clear when it cut 10 million from its contribution to the 1985 budget of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which has a program here But a provision attached to the foreign aid bill last week by the House of Representatives raised the issue to a new level by stating as a fact that China relies on coerced abortion and sterilization which it described as crimes against humanity The House acted just as the Chinese President Li Xiannian was departing for an official visit to Canada and the United States His angry comments showed how quickly civilities between the two countries can become strained The 76yearold Red Army veteran called the measure a distortion and fabrication He added The Chinese people are indignant to the utmost degree It was not the first time this month that Chinese leaders have offered a reminder that their values are not the Wests Roman Catholics including many Americans had petitioned for years for the release of the Bishop of Shanghai Ignatius Kung who was jailed in 1955 for refusing to abjure the authority of the Vatican When Mr Deng finally ordered him freed he was subjected to an exercise in political theater that won few hearts abroad The 84yearold bishop was required to sign an official statement of repentance in court in the presence of Chinese journalists then he was photographed kissing the ring of the man appointed by Peking to supplant him as head of the Shanghai diocese Bishop Louis Zhang Jiashu It was an eloquent demonstration of the limits on the new freedoms permitted under Mr Deng Bishop Kung however would undoubtedly agree that on average the Chinese are far better off than at any time since the mid1950s when the Communists regained their breath after the civil war and began imposing their new order But the wider latitude in almost every area has been clearly circumscribed The good of the country as defined by the party not individual or group welfare remains paramount Mr Deng has been characteristically frank Instead of the talk about human rights under socialism that emanates from the Soviet Union the Chinese leader has said that when it comes to a choice between modernization and individual rights modernization comes first In religion this has meant that many faiths have been revived and more than 40000 churches mosques and other places of worship reopened always on condition that they accept supervision from Peking If a religious figure does something construed as unpatriotic he can expect to be constrained or worse And the pattern holds for individual or creative endeavor in journalism literature and theater in the nascent practice of law and across the gamut of resurgent intellectual life BackStreet Tabloids In a country where more than 80 percent of the people are peasants such constraints mainly concern the educated minority Even among intellectuals complaints are far less common than praise for Mr Dengs openmindedness As a result Westerners and Chinese often look at the same events from opposite angles When Bishop Kung was released most Chinese seemed more impressed at the solution to a problem left over from the past than by the embarrassing genuflexion required of the prelate Compared with most Communist countries China has been undergoing an explosion of selfexpression Presses that once churned out little but the thoughts of Mao are producing thousands of journals on everything from quantum mechanics to modern dance Vendors in every town are hawking skimpy tabloids produced on backstreet presses which offer a mixture of romance mystery and hokum The party press has been declaiming against the competition for months but still the tabloids keep coming Within the party Mr Deng has made a modest start toward giving substance to democracy Tens of thousands of minor officeholders have had to face rival candidates in elections Officials have been told that they must stay in touch with the grass roots or face dismissal Yesterday it was announced that Deng Liqun the partys chief propagandist had been replaced He had been considered an opponent of liberalism But Mr Deng clearly wants to be judged not on progress toward political and cultural modernization but on the success of his economic reforms While it is too soon to say whether market mechanisms and foreign technology will produce prosperity his encouragement of smallscale private enterprise has already produced millions of merchants offering choices to a public previously served only by state and cooperative stores To many Chinese this may be the most important new freedom of all
HOLDEN CAULFIELD'S KID SISTER GETS PREGNANT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/14/books/holden-caulfield-s-kid-sister-gets-pregnant.html,THE BOOK OF PHOEBE By MaryAnn Tirone Smith 280 pp New York Doubleday  Company 1595 HOLDEN CAULFIELD the hero of what was the comingofage novel for several generations had a little sister named Phoebe of whom he was touchingly proud She was only 10 years old but already she was writing books  which she never finished  and seemed an appealingly quirky little kid Phoebe Desmonds mother took The Catcher in the Rye so to heart that it determined her first childs name And this first novel is that childs own comingofage story told in a voice one could easily imagine as the precocious Phoebe Caulfields own At least there is something more than faintly reminiscent of Holdens voice with the achingly sensitive passivity replaced by a confident activism But there is the old Caulfield impatience with phoniness which together with an adolescent awkwardness and gaucheness provide much of the humor of this very funny book Phoebe Desmond is such an activist that at the age of 13 she takes over Grants Tomb together with her disturbed cousin Tyrus to call attention to the plight of the mentally handicapped And she is so confident that when she learns she is pregnant at the age of 19 and three weeks into her first love affair she takes a leave of absence from Yale and goes to Paris to have the baby She is determined no one will know of its existence most particularly the father who turns out to be undeserving of both Phoebe and their progeny Falling immediately out of love with him I looked into his sly hazel eyes for the last time and I will go to the grave knowing that hell never know he had a baby Phoebe chooses to hide out in Paris because her very best friend Marlys lives there Phoebe counts on Marlys to help her through the pregnancy and Marlys is clearly a woman who can get things done She is like Phoebe gifted This Phoebe having no older brother to sing her praises must tell us herself and often how smart she is But instead of going to Yale or Harvard Marlys who is black decided to chuck it all and go to Paris where in less than six months she becomes a famous American expatriate The star of the FoliesBergere she is the toast of the town the Josephine Baker of the eighties Because Marlys is so busy she arranges for Phoebe to live with a young artist named Ben Reuben with whom Phoebe immediately falls in love A person like me who tends to fall victim so effortlessly to love at first sight also tends not to learn from experience At Yale it had taken two meetings In Paris it was taking two seconds Fortunately for Phoebe Ben also falls effortlessly in love When Ben asks Phoebe why she hadnt chosen to have an abortion we learn of the sad and funny friendship of a younger Phoebe and the mad middleaged Tyrus She hands Ben a journal He reads and so do we The inventive 13yearold had turned the facts of the story into wild fiction  as if the facts werent wild enough  so that her aunts and uncles and cousins become crooks and kidnappers But Phoebe swears to Ben that all the facts about Tyrus are true He had been kept hidden in the family attic since he was 9 years old and there occupied himself listening to polka records reading heavy tomes about the Second World War and believing himself to be Gen George Patton and other sundry World War II characters The family loves and protects him but thinks hes retarded Phoebe tries to explain to them that retarded people dont spend all their time reading His delusions are quite funny of course but there is nothing meanspirited about the laughter they provoke Just like Phoebe one smiles at Tyrus with a tug at the heart for he is as trusting and vulnerable as a child Or as the young Phoebe herself puts it Its my belief that kids and mentally ill people have quite a lot in common The sad ending of the tale of Tyrus explains why Phoebe decides to carry her baby to term Ben doesnt read the journal at one sitting so the story of Phoebe and Tyrus is interspersed with the story of Phoebe and Ben It is probably a measure of my involvement in both tales that I found myself becoming annoyed each time Ben either takes up or leaves off reading the journal The technical difficulties involved in weaving together the two tales are for the most part worked out quite neatly Paramount among these perhaps is adjusting Phoebes two voices so that the reader believes the 13yearold in the diary could grow up to be the 19yearold who runs off to Paris Im not sure this problem is worked out entirely The younger Phoebes powers of expression are so extraordinary for a child of her age that despite selfavowals of giftedness they approach the borders of unbelievability The elder Phoebe does not seem to have made any substantial progress beyond her former precocious self Where we might ask are the signs of the three and a half years she has studied at Yale Whatwas she studying A smart kid like Phoebe should have got a lot more out of a firstclass education At the end of the book having undergone various growing experiences which include most importantly carrying and giving birth to a child she knows she cannot keep Phoebe knows what she wants to be when she grows up And so we are left with a first novel very much like its heroine extremely likable and filled with the promise of a perhaps even brighter future
VISIT FROM A 'MENTAL ASTRONAUT',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/14/books/visit-from-a-mental-astronaut.html,PAPER DAUGHTER Autobiography in Search of a Father Volume Two By Jill Johnston Illustrated 287 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 1695 ONE summer day 19 years ago on her weekly visit with her children who were normally in their fathers charge Jill Johnston made an unprecedented gesture she consulted them about how they might like to spend the afternoon Her reward was the thunderbolt recognition that they had ideas I had actually lived with two beings whom I had assumed to have no center of feeling consciousness spirit or intelligence of their own Her son and daughter were 8 years old and 6 years old Miss Johnston was entering her late 30s But she was and may still be mired in some psychic substratum that distances her profoundly from the common human needs of others We know Miss Johnston as a sometime dance critic a flagwaver for the avantgarde arts of the 1960s a crusading lesbian and above all a Village Voice diarist with a chaotic style and a cult following What makes her especially interesting is the blend of flinty intelligence and emotional illiteracy expressed in her writing If the combination is not unique still the capacity to reveal it is nearly riveting Most of us wouldnt dare But then few of us would have the nerve to embark on writing what threatens to become a shelf of books devoted to Miss Johnstons life and times Paper Daughter sequel to the 1983 Mother Bound is the second volume of Autobiography in Search of a Father and hardly steps into the 1970s Between 1965 and 1969 Miss Johnston tells us she lost her reason three times These were not muted breakdowns but terrible sieges of delirium She became a mental astronaut  the human equivalent of the problemplagued Gemini 5 At various times she cast herself not only as the Mother of Christ but as Christ and thought she had established with certainty that she was the daughter of the poet Apollinaire There were periods of hospitalization In the Kafkaesque setting that was Bellevue the patient was no more than a paper daughter existing on medical forms merely as a name and a diagnosis chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia In her less unstable moments Miss Johnston shrewdly judged herself to be a kind of bystander to my life This position allows her to write of her madness and other harrowing episodes in piercing detail and with as much feeling as if she were producing a manual on the art of motorcycle maintenance without the Zen Here she is on the manic fantasies that filled her days and informed the hectic freeform Village Voice columns she began to turn out during her illnesses It was this very lack of reality that made me so creative    With one or two bare facts at my disposal I felt free to embroider quite a large picture I assume that this is what people do who know or have been told very little and that I had done this all along but had until now kept it to myself and from myself as well In some sense a psychosis is nothing but the exposure of hitherto concealed thought constructs The barriers between Miss Johnston and her reader inevitably exist between Miss Johnston and almost everyone encountered in her book A lover leaves her for a man and however important this woman may have been she is given neither the outlines of a personality nor a name Miss Johnston was living in and writing about a seismic cultural period in dance music and art amid such radical artists and performers as Robert Rauschenberg John Cage Merce Cunningham George Segal Allan Kaprow Lucas Samaras they flicker through her pages like so many ghosts hardly leaving an imprint Paper Daughter represents not only Miss Johnstons status in Bellevue but also her standing as a fatherless child The obsessive yearning for an absent unknowable parent is fascinating pathetic and finally tedious With rare exceptions no woman ever gets the father she really deserves if siblings divorce or early death dont savage her expectations then her mother will probably do her in Miss Johnston bears the customary grievances against the only parent she ever knew As she told us in Mother Bound she grew up on Long Island mostly in a grandmothers care believing that her father was dead When she was 20 years old and in college she learned that he had just died an obituary had appeared in The New York Times and her mother fearing discovery sent her the clipping Miss Johnston was told all her life that she had been a child of divorce A few years later she figured out that there had never been a wedding her mother an American nurse had a romance with a rich dashing Englishman who was willing to buy her an expensive abortion but would not marry her N OT only was he monied but in the first picture she ever saw of him her father proved important enough to be photographed standing between King George and Queen Mary grandparents of the present monarch While letting us know that her father is the subject of this book Miss Johnston an expert tease never tells us his name or what she has discovered about his life Presumably the details will turn up in Volume Three Meanwhile in Paper Daughter as in Mother Bound she wrestles with gender confusion without enlightening the reader In the company of couples she is one of the boys thats how George Segal plastercast her in a group scene with their friends When she falls in love with a woman she becomes a real girl once again It is odd that Miss Johnston a feminist persists in defining herself as a girl a term the womens movement has struggled mightily to place in its proper context And yet with her especially stunted inner spirit her unyielding selfabsorption her poorpatheticPearl grudges and her adolescent longings  I was desperate to be Jewish  there is a case to be made that inside this mature woman dwelt an unformed child She keeps telling us that she was working her way to a different personhood Maybe in the next book we will get a grownup THE AVANTGARDE HAS RECEDED The avantgarde world that Jill Johnston chronicled as a critic and diarist for The Village Voice until 1980 is but a shadowy presence in Paper Daughter the second volume of her autobiography As she said in an interview her concerns in the book were not artistic but political The art world to me is like a kind of painting background material cast of characters like dream figures said the 56yearold author who lives in New York I feel Im doing something political in the book which largely narrates the breakdowns she suffered in the late 60s and which centers on illegitimacy  the truth about her birth which her mother kept from her for 20 years The political message underlying all this is that the way my mother handled the situation was determined by her fears as a woman what people would think of her She is working on the third volume of her autobiography  in which she reveals her fathers identity  and on a novel about the 70s As for todays avantgarde she said theres much more of it  of people writing and of the work In the 60s there were only a couple of other writers besides myself who were really interested It seems much more dispersed now along with the scene itself  Patricia T OConner
DECISION AWAITED ON ABORTION CLINIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/14/nyregion/decision-awaited-on-abortion-clinic.html,THE opponents legal battle against abortion has reached a White Plains courtroom where a State Supreme Court judge is deciding whether to allow a righttolife group to file suit against a White Plains abortion clinic Represented by A Lawrence Washburn Jr who gained national attention by intervening in the Baby Jane Doe case four members of the Westchester Right to Life Committee are demanding that the state enforce its licensing powers against the Westchester Womens Health Organization Clinic in White Plains the countys only outofhospital abortion clinic The clinic at 20 Church Street is unlicensed antiabortionists assert and is therefore operating illegally While state officials concede that the clinic is unlicensed they described the whole situation as a legal netherworld  because the clinics application is pending and because Planned Parenthood of Westchester is seeking to acquire the clinics fixed assets so it can run the facility itself In January of this year the State Health Department approved Planned Parenthoods application subject to the completion of certain work on the facility and the acquisition of certain equipment Those conditions should be met within the next couple of weeks Planned Parenthood officials said During a previous legal battle concerning the clinic a Federal judge gave the clinic permission to continue functioning while its license was pending Last week the Westchester Womens Health Organization suspended operations at its White Plains site because said Susan Hill executive director of the National Womens Health Organization the clinics parent organization we are tired of waiting for this matter to be resolved In papers filed with Justice Louis Palella the antiabortion group described its suit as a class action intended to halt the operation of all unlicensed abortion clinics in the state which they say number nearly 100 Frances Tarlton a spokesman for the State Health Department denied the existence of that many illegal clinics and said We are aware of only three scofflaw abortion clinics in the state those clinics that are currently unlicensed and we are taking action The three clinics  which do not include the Westchester Womens Health Organization clinic which is classified as license pending  are the Bill Baird Family Planning Clinic in Hempstead LI the Womens Pavilion in Deer Park and the South Shore Family Planning Center in Far Rockaway The states jurisdiction over abortion facilities Mrs Tarlton said currently rests on the corporate organization of the service rather than the service offered That is if an abortion facility operates as a doctors office the state has no jurisdiction over it but Mrs Tarlton said the department was seeking legislation to change what she called a ridiculous problem Doctors are independently licensed and the state does not control the operation of their offices even if the doctors offer abortion services There are a total of 17 abortion clinics in the state licensed by the Health Department  and that figure includes the Westchester Womens Health Organization clinic although that licensing arrangement is the subject of the current dispute There were 6944 abortion procedures performed in Westchester in 1983 the last year for which figures are available from Planned Parenthood of Westchester Ninetythree percent of these procedures were performed in outofhospital facilities in either a doctors office or in the Westchester Womens Health Organiztion clinic The rest were performed in hospitals Defendants named in the suit also include the states Health Department and Planned Parenthood of Westchester which is awaiting final state approval to take over the Westchester Womens Health Organization clinic Defendants have asked Judge Palella to dismiss the righttolife motion on numerous technical grounds These technical issues said Sandra Forster law clerk to Judge Palella may cause a detour in the quest for a meritorious decision Because Planned Parenthood does not yet own the clinic and cannot operate it the organization has asked to be dropped as one of the defendants Other defendants in the case have charged that the antiabortion representatives lack standing to bring suit at all Some decision announcing the next steps in the case may be expected within six weeks Mrs Forster said but she added given all the motions we are a long way from discussing the merits Mr Washburn lawyer for the petitioners said recently that all I want is to have clinics brought up to standard And he added What the law requires is an operating certificate and the Westchester Womens Health Organization doesnt have one Mr Washburn who practices law both in Albany and New York City gained prominence when he tried unsuccessfully to force the parents of a severely handicapped child Baby Jane Doe to order an operation for her He is also known for his threeyear effort to defend the Federal Hyde Amendment banning Medicade reimbursement for abortions except those performed to save the mothers life Although Mr Washburn lost the case in the lower courts the Supreme Court eventually overturned the lower court decision One party in the antiabortion action Patricia Hatcher conceded that it would be idiotic to say I am not interested in this case as a RighttoLifer Mrs Hatcher a member of the Westchester Right to Life Committee added If abortions are curtailed by clinics having to close down because they are unlicensed that would be wonderful But this case Mrs Hatcher said represented an effort to protect the safety of women who do have abortions We are saying these clinics ought to be regulated and inspected to protect a womans health she said adding If the Westchester Womens Health Organization clinic was a restaurant it would have been closed down years ago but because its an abortion clinic the state doesnt care State officials said they had continued to monitor the quality of care at the clinic and added that they had received no complaints about clinic care during the facilitys eight years in White Plains The Westchester Womens Health Organization has been involved in protracted legal battles with the State Health Department since it began operations in 1977 According to Mrs Hill  We are not scofflaws Weve been in the application and hearing process eight years There is no doubt regulations governing abortion clinics in New York State have been applied unevenly in New York State and we have been challenging those regulations One major legal question has concerned the status of the organization  whether it should be considered as a doctors office or as a clinic Deborah Bachrach chief assistant attorney general for New York who is representing the Health Department in the current dispute said that the state had the power to license the facility as a clinic As the Westchester Womens Health Organization began its application procedure the state attempted to fine the clinic as a scofflaw for failing to obtain an operating license The clinic appealed and a Federal court settlement in 1983 by Federal Judge Thomas Griesa allowed the clinic to continue to operate so long as it pursued due diligence in obtaining a license That process Miss Bachrach said normally takes 18 months As the clinic began the licensing application and sought a certificate of need for its operation the clinic was disapproved by everyone on the grounds of character and competence as well as financial feasibility said Mrs Tarlton speaking for the State Health Department The clinic appealed that decision but before the hearing could be concluded the clinic had begun negotiations with Planned Parenthood of Westchester I thought I was doing the state a favor by turning matters over to Planned Parenthood Mrs Hill said adding But then Washburn stepped in The board of directors of Planned Parenthood had previously decided to offer a full range of reproductive services in Westchester including a program for pregnant teenagers venerealdisease screening infertility counselling and firsttrimester abortion services in addition to the information on contraceptives it had always provided We were intereted in providing abortion services so that we could offer contraceptive services in the process said Francine Stein executive director of Planned Parenthood This is prochoice county with a prochoice constituency and the availability of safe and legal abortion in this county has played a major role in improving maternal health

U.S. BRIEF ASKS COURT TO REVERSE ABORTION RULING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/us/us-brief-asks-court-to-reverse-abortion-ruling.html,The Reagan Administration asked the Supreme Court today to overrule its 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion and to return the law to the condition in which it was before that case was decided Abortion was a matter of state law before the Court ruled in Roe v Wade that a womans decision to end a pregnancy was part of a fundamental right of privacy protected by the 14th Amendment At the time of the 1973 decision women who obtained abortions and doctors who performed the operation both faced criminal penalties in many states In a Supreme Court brief urging the Justices to uphold state laws restricting access to abortions in Pennsylvania and Illinois the Administration said that the textual doctrinal and historical basis for Roe v Wade is so far flawed and is such a source of instability in the law that the Court should abandon it Federal courts of appeals declared both state laws unconstitutional in what the Administrations brief today called harsh and onesided decisions that betrayed unabashed hostility to state regulation of abortion and illdisguised suspicion of state legislators motives Ruling Is Affirmed The lower courts  the United States Courts of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago  based their rulings on Roe v Wade and on subsequent Supreme Court decisions that reaffirmed and elaborated on that ruling Two years ago the Court emphatically reaffirmed Roe v Wade in a 6to3 decision that struck down an array of abortion restrictions imposed by the city council of Akron Ohio In his majority opinion in the Akron case Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr declared that the doctrine of adherence to precedent is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law The Administration had also filed a brief in the Akron case in support of the restrictions That brief stopped short of asking the Court to overrule Roe v Wade But the approach to abortion that the brief endorsed had the Court accepted it would have accomplished much the same result The Akron decision was widely seen as a setback if not a direct rebuke to the Administration Given the strong tone of the opinion the Courts insistence on upholding precedent and the fact that the Courts membership has not changed it appeared highly unlikely that the Administrations arguments would succeed this time Move Is Called Political Leaders of organizations supporting the right to abortion denounced the brief filed today as an effort to appeal not to the Justices but to the Administrations antiabortion constituency David Andrews executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said the filing of the brief was a blatant political move designed to appease the antiabortion factions in America Janet Benshoof director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union accused the Administration of using briefwriting instead of press releases to push an ideological platform She said the brief marked the first time in the history of this country that the Government has ever called for taking away a constitutional right that had been recognized by the Supreme Court Larry Speakes the White House spokesman said at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center today that President Reagan had pesonally approved the filing of the brief In January the President addressed a large antiabortion rally in Washington to mark the 12th anniversary of Roe v Wade Calling abortion a horror and a tragedy he declared The momentum is with us Praise for Action Edward Grant executive director of the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund said today that his organization was extremely pleased to have the Governments support Mr Grants Chicagobased organization brought the appeal of the Illinois ruling to the Supreme Court Its initial petition informed the Court that the appeal of the Seventh Circuits ruling was also being brought in the name of the State of Illinois That was not the case however and a spokesman for Jill WineBanks the Illinois solicitor general said today that the state would not file a brief in defense of the law The Pennsylvania law is similar to the Akron ordinance that the Court found unconstitutional Like the Akron ordinance it requires that women be warned that an abortion may have unforeseen and detrimental physical and psychological effects The Illinois law has a somewhat different focus making doctors who cause the abortion of a viable fetus subject to criminal prosecution The law defines a fetus as a human being from fertilization to birth a definition the Court of Appeals said forces the physician to act as the mouthpiece for the states theory of life The Administrations brief generally steered clear of the theoretical debate over when life begins It noted however that in the 1860s when the 14th Amendment which guarantees the due process of law was adopted many states were passing antiabortion laws directed at what was widely viewed as a moral evil comprehending the destruction of actual or potential human life The brief said that the drafters of the 14th Amendment would have been surprised indeed by the Roe v Wade decision
6 DEFORMED BABIES IN INDIA LINKED TO BHOPAL GAS LEAK,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/world/6-deformed-babies-in-india-linked-to-bhopal-gas-leak.html,A state health minister said today that 36 pregnant women spontaneously aborted and that 6 gave births to deformed babies after the toxic gas leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal here in December Private groups had said there were hundreds of abortions stillbirths and births of deformed babies after the gas leak Autopsies conducted on 27 other stillborn babies indicated the possibility that their deaths had been caused by methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from the pesticide plant according to Balendu Shukla the Madhya Pradesh public health minister The minister said that medical scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research had so far examined 1350 infants born after the Dec 3 gas leak and that 15 were found to be deformed In six cases the deformity was linked to inhalation of methyl isocyanate gas by their mothers he said Private groups had said claimed there were hundreds of abortions stillbirths and births of deformed babies after the gas leak
A SURGEON OPERATES OUTSIDE HIS HOSPITAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/nyregion/a-surgeon-operates-outside-his-hospital.html,More and more of Dr Frederick M Golombs surgical patients never see the inside of a hospital Like surgeons everywhere Dr Golomb is performing more surgery outside the hospital  in his case at the Day Surgery Center at the New York University Medical Center Patients who once were hospitalized for nearly a week he said now come in for surgery much like they would visit a doctors office They are sent home a few hours later Dr Golomb receives the same fee for a surgical procedure whether it is performed in or out of the hospital But the savings in costs to patients and health insurers are considerable The cost for example of performing a dilatation and curettage the most common gynecological procedure in University Hospital where a patient is hospitalized overnight is 2637 The cost for the same procedure at the Day Surgery Center is 275 Avoiding 4 Days in Hospital New procedures also cut costs On June 27 for example Dr Golomb removed a cancerous lesion from the arm of an elderly woman He was able to send her home from the Day Surgery Center an hour or so later because he used a surgical procedure he developed while operating on wounded soldiers in the Korean War Removing the womans melanoma on an inpatient basis would have cost 4636 based on four days of hospitalization With Dr Golombs innovation the cost at the Day Surgery was 550 and the patient avoided the medical risks of infection that are involved in any hospitalization Similarly Dr Livia Wan a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology is able to perform a tubal ligation at Day Surgery and eliminate the two days of hospitalization that the procedure normally involves 4500 Procedures The Day Surgery Center was the first selfcontained outpatient surgery center in the New York metropolitan area when it opened in 1979 It is on the second floor of the Arnold and Marie Schwartz Health Care Center at the NYU medical campus on First Avenue at 31st Street In its first year doctors at the center performed 1000 procedures Last year they performed 4500 compared with 14000 done by doctors who hospitalized their patients at NYU Outpatient surgery or day surgery as it also is called has increased dramatically as health insurers try to cut costs and as surgeons continue to perfect techniques that permit less invasive diagnostic procedures and surgery When outpatient surgery was revived in this country in the late 1960s only a few surgical procedures were done outside of hospitals Now however the major insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Greater New York and Medicare and Medicaid recommend that hundreds of procedures can be done safely and effectively on an outpatient basis The growing list includes biopsies hernia repairs uncomplicated plastic and laser surgery abortions cataract and lens replacement procedures hand surgery cobalt implants tonsillectomies cardiac catherization and numerous kinds of internal diagnostic examinations One reason day surgery has been so successful at NYU is the long wait to gain admission to University Hospital for elective surgery Surgeons needed an alternative site if they intended to keep their patients at NYU
A CLASH ON FAMILY PLANNING AT KENYA PARLEY ON WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/17/garden/a-clash-on-family-planning-at-kenya-parley-on-women.html,The exchange took place in a family planning workshop at the nongovernmental forum of the United Nations Decade for Women conference here An Indian who opposes abortion told the audience that the way to control population is to get men to wait to get their sexual desire under control An American woman shot back What if we want sex honey The incident pointed up the dichotomy between those at the conference who assert that women must control their own bodies and a small but wellorganized group that calls abortion murder and any artificial method of contraception abortofacient abortionmaking That dichotomy in turn reflects several divisions between for example industrialized nations where women usually have access to a variety of contraceptive methods and developing countries where such means are generally restricted between wellfinanced wellorganized antiabortion organizations in the West and family planning groups in developing countries which assert that limiting family size is crucial to economic development and sometimes to survival itself The fact of the matter is all the developed countries are using contraception in planning their families said Avabai B Wadia of India president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation Why should there be any objection if developing countries voluntarily take up these programs and want smaller families than they can care for In Africa the debate over population control is complicated by the fact that many women oppose the use of drugs and are hostile to values they see as foisted on them by the West We are fighting the common belief that the white man is trying to limit the number of our people said Joyce Nkausu an official with the Zambia Family Planning Association Several groups that oppose abortion and artificial contraception have attended family planning workshops at Forum 85  an assembly of nongovernmental groups coinciding with the official Decade for Women conference  to counter the argument that the developing world must have access to all varieties of family planning from sex education to sterilization They are drawing on the resources of the Roman Catholic Church in Kenya and some are staying with local religious orders Because abortion which is usually the focus of their attacks is illegal in most of the developing world their primary target at the womens conference is the International Planned Parenthood Federation the largest nongovernmental family planning organization in the world with affiliates in 120 countries They condemn artificial contraception as immoral and object to the federations sexeducation program charging that it encourages children to be sexually active International Planned Parenthood is bigoted and racist said James L Deger an official of the Washingtonbased American Life League Basically all their activities very easily fall within the definition of genocide Reflecting on calls for population control in the third world Mr Deger said The main reason why there are food shortages and all that in Africa is local problems in food storage and government policies The American Life League was one of the groups that successfully lobbied the Reagan Administration to withhold 10 million of its 46 million contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities The league had charged that China which receives financial support from the fund forces women to have abortions as part of its family planning program The antiabortion groups also oppose the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination in All Forms Against Women which the United States has signed asserting that it concentrates on placing women in the work force and fails to recognize mens role in procreation Officials of the International Planned Parenthood Federation denied that it advocates abortion as a method of family planning To call us racist is absurd Mrs Wadia said The federation which describes itself as a group of autonomous national family planning organizations is defended by most African governments and Western financial supporters which maintain that population control is crucial for the continents healthy economic development Women must control their own fertility which forms the basis for enjoying all other rights Sally Mugabe the head of Zimbabwes delegation and the wife of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe told journalists this week First and foremost our bodies belong to us Mrs Mugabe said Many antiabortion groups and family planning experts agree on one thing that DepoProvera a longlasting birth control drug banned in the United States but available in much of the developing world should no longer be distributed The drugs side effects include excessive bleeding weight gain and mood changes it has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals We see women who say they would rather die than have another child said Margaret Thuo information and educational officer for the Family Planning Association of Kenya in explaining why the drug is still used The Kenyan association has led a number of educational programs for women and men relying on the media songs stories and theatrical presentations to get across the message that  in a country with one of the highest birthrates in the world both sexes must learn to limit the size of their families But even in Kenya where the Government sees the birthrate as its most critical economic problem traditional beliefs are not easily relinquished On a recent tour of a family planning center one Government official told a family planning advocate God will send natural ways for family planning like Bhopal and the famine At Bhopal India more than 2000 people died last December when a pesticide ingredient leaked from a Union Carbide plant The unavailability of legal abortions has led many African women to obtain illegal ones In Kenya illegal abortions are common and every year thousands of women are admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for complications resulting from botched abortions according to the Ministry of Health Some Kenyan women are even more desperate The Kenya Times recently reported that a pregnant woman from the town of Kiambu who fought with her boyfriend and was rejected by her parents poured paraffin on her body and set herself afire in an unsuccessful suicide attempt
GRANT DELAY: GROUP AT ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/17/garden/grant-delay-group-at-issue.html,The Justice Departments recent delay of a 625000 grant for the nations largest coalition of shelters for battered women has produced a philosophical debate among officials of the department Capitol Hill conservatives President Reagans daughter Maureen and other feminists The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence which represents 748 shelters for battered women has worked with the Attorney Generals Task Force on Family Violence for more than a year to develop strategies to combat domestic violence With the unanimous consent of the task force and its chairman Lois Haight Herrington an Assistant Attorney General a 625000 grant to the coalition was to have been announced in early June But the day before the scheduled announcement Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d received a letter criticizing the coalition from Patrick McGuigan of the Free Congress Foundation a Washingtonbased research group This country may need to spend 600000 to combat domestic violence Mr McGuigan wrote but it doesnt need to spend one red cent to finance liberal antifamily activism Representative Mark D Siljander Republican of Michigan and 23 other members of Congress who described themselves as profamily Republicans wrote another letter calling the coalition a prolesbian proabortion antiReagan radical feminist group Since then the grant has been under review The money was intended for national publicawareness and prevention campaigns model shelter programs a national information and referral service and training for lawenforcement agencies that deal with battered women The Free Congress Foundation and other critics of the coalition expressed concern that in addition the Federal money would be used for the coalitions task force that deals with violence among lesbians The critics said that the coalition promoted homosexuality and was therefore antifamily For them to portray us as antifamily is totally absurd said Joan W Welsh chairman of the coalition What we are about is trying to end violence against families There are lesbian women who are battered women and we are working to try to get the word out to them that there is help available she said Other coalition groups work with rural women minority women and women who have been battered in the past Patrick F Fagan director of the Child and Family Protection Institute at the Free Congress Foundation said that the coalition as a feminist organization was antifamily The coalition has a very different view on marriage and sexuality than those of the traditional JudeoChristian values he said The feminist agenda puts the woman paramount in a selfish way He said churchrelated groups or community mental health centers should be used as shelters Last week at a State Department briefing on the conference of the United Nations Decade for Women whose official meeting convened Monday Maureen Reagan criticized Mr Meese for delaying the grant calling the action patently absurd Thats the same kind of problem weve had over the years by people who refer to shelters for battered women as RR centers for bored housewives Miss Reagan said Mrs Herrington met with Mr Siljander last week to emphasize that under the terms of the grant no money would go to the lesbian task force In a letter she gave to Mr Siljander at the meeting she also said The concern that Government resources not be used to further goals unshared by the majority is a legitimate one The letter continued Grant funds may only be used with specific Justice Department consent The letter said that domestic violence should not be considered a feminist or political issue If a doctor found a cure for cancer we would not fail to use it because we dislike his politics Mrs Herrington said There are gay women in this endeavor just as there are homemakers mothers fathers and ministers Ronald E Brackin press secretary for Mr Siljander said the Congressman would consider withdrawing his opposition to the grant if he was convinced the lesbian elements in the coalition would not receive money
BISHOP SELECTED TO HEAD DIOCESE OF LOS ANGELES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/17/us/bishop-selected-to-head-diocese-of-los-angeles.html,Pope John Paul II today chose a native of California who speaks Spanish and has a long record as an activist on social issues to head the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles the nations largest Bishop Roger Mahony 49 years old the Bishop of Stockton in northern California was appointed to succeed Cardinal Timothy Manning who submitted his resignation last fall after reaching the churchs mandatory reirement age of 75 As head of the nations most populous diocese one with more than 26 million parishoners in Los Angeles Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties Bishop Mahony is widely expected in church circles to be elevated to the rank of Cardinal within a year or two In addition to Cardinal Manning four other Americans are currently in the 120member College of Cardinals Cardinal John J OConnor of New York Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago and Cardinal John Joseph Krol of Philadelphia Cardinal Manning a conservative on religious matters and a moderate on social issues has headed the Archdiocese since 1966 when he succeeded Cardinal James Frances McIntyre who was regarded as an autocratic bulwark of conservatism within the church hierarchy Cardinal Mannings first step as Archbishop was to move out of a large mansion used by Cardinal McIntyre into a modest rectory in a rundown section of downtown Los Angeles A popular figure among Catholics here he shunned leadership roles in the church politics outside of Los Angeles so that in his tenure the archdiocese despite its size did not play a commensurate role in the church at large Bishop Mahony as a parish priest in Los Angeles where he was born and in Stockton a farming center in Californias rich Central Valley has had a reputation for sticking close to the Vaticans position on such disputed issues within the church as abortion and birth control while helping to lead efforts for social and economic change He was appointed by Gov Edmund G Brown Jr in 1975 to serve as the first chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board which was established to administer Californias collective bargaining law for farm workers Two years later in an unusual political step by a clergymen he criticized Mr Browns appointment of Rose Elizabeth Bird the state agriculgture director as Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court He called Miss Bird who is now the subject of a conservativeled ouster effort vindictive and of questionable emotional stability Bishop Mahony is said to speak Spanish fluently and has been popular with farm workers and Hispanic priests and political leaders in the state Bishop Mahony issued a pastoral letter denouncing the use of nuclear arms as an instrument of national policy in 1981 two years before the National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a similar letter His appointment today was widely regarded in church circles here as a bid by the Vatican to forge better links with southern Californias growing Hispanic population and to arrest a growing defection of Mexican immigrants to religious fundamentalist sects While many of the immigrants as in their homelands join local Roman Catholic parishes here Catholic officials say they are troubled that many do not and that increasingly they have been losing Hispanic newcomers to fundamentalist sects In the agricultural fields of the Central Valley Bishop Mahony has tried to reach the newcomers through the establishment of small familyoriented Bible study groups In a telephone interview he indicated he would do the same thing as Archbishop here Most of the new immigrants he said have come from small villages where everyone attended the local Catholic Church Here it is more pluralistic he said They dont have the builtin support system its very easyt to drift to someplace else The church he said will have to work to retain these immigrants in their new environment

Still Hostile to a Woman's Right,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/opinion/still-hostile-to-a-woman-s-right.html,As ten thousand women meet in Kenya to observe the end of the United Nations Decade for Women the Reagan Administration tried again this week to set back the calendar in its own benighted way It asked the Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 decision recognizing a womans right to decide to end a pregnancy In that decision Roe v Wade Justice Blackmun held that a fetus cannot be considered a person in the constitutional sense He therefore rejected the view that abortion pits a womans 14th Amendment rights to personal liberty and privacy against a persons right to life Instead he held that a womans rights must be weighed against the fetuss growing potential for life And from this Justice Blackmun reasoned sensibly that the states interest in protecting life increases as the fetus grows closer to term The Court thus left the decision on abortion during the first three months of pregnancy to a woman and her doctor allowed some limitation on abortion in the second trimester and even greater limitation in the third The Justice Departments latest reactionary response is to argue in connection with antiabortion statutes in Illinois and Pennsylvania that abortion is more properly a matter for states to regulate restrict or even declare criminal as they see fit Yet as the department surely knows the Court emphatically turned back a prior attack on Roe v Wade and will probably do so again So what is the Administrations point Before the American Bar Association convention in London Attorney General Meese tried to dignify his quixotic enterprise with a specious analogy The departments duty to act against abortion he said was as great as the duty to urge repeal of the Courts separate but equal doctrine in the 1954 school desegregation cases What a perversion to equate an assault on an important right of women with enlightened defense of the civil rights of black Americans The Attorney General in any case masks the cynical implication of his policy The main effect of returning legal authority over abortion to the states would be to restrict the availability of abortion to women affluent enough to travel  to more liberal states or say Canada If Mr Meese had his way only the poor would be forced to choose between pregnancy and the backalley abortionist
In Re Politics v. Punches,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/us/in-re-politics-v-punches.html,In pressing its social agenda on a reluctant Supreme Court the Reagan Administration appears to have concluded that there are more important goals than winning cases The brief the Administration filed Monday asking the Court to overrule the decision that established a constitutional right to abortion was the latest evidence of a new stance toward the Court That document as well as recent briefs on affirmative action and religion place a much higher priority on giving full expression to a legal and social philosophy than on the traditional effort to tailor arguments to those most likely to persuade a majority of Justices The Administrations critics who were out in force this week to respond to the abortion brief see the strategy as a cynical effort to talk past an unresponsive Court and use the briefs to reach particular special interest constituencies Spokesmen for both the National Abortion Rights Action League and Planned Parenthood described the abortion brief as blatantly political designed to placate the Administrations antiabortion allies who despite President Reagans frequently encouraging words have not accomplished their goals in Congress or the courts Although antiabortion leaders praised the decision to file the brief they conceded there was only a remote chance the Court will overrule the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling Not surprisingly Administration officials portray the matter quite differently Why tiptoe around said one rebutting a suggestion that the abortion brief could have asked the Court to uphold the two state laws at issue on grounds less sweeping than overruling Roe v Wade The political strategy would be to write briefs that pull analytical punches he added We owe it to the Court to follow our arguments through to their logical limits That is a change in tone for the Government which through the Justice Departments Office of the Solicitor General is the most frequent litigator before the Court The traditional approach was expressed by Rex E Lee two months ago just before he resigned as Solicitor General to return to teaching and law practice The principal responsibility of the Solicitor General is to win cases in the Supreme Court and to maintain the stature of the office Mr Lee said in an interview Where that can be done consistent with the broader principles the incumbent President may hold thats fine But my audience in the final analysis is not millions not thousands or even hundreds but nine While the abortion brief is the clearest break with the past the new stance evolved to some degree in Mr Lees tenure Experience in the Supreme Court term that ended this month indicates that the new approach may not be riskfree With hindsight some Justice Department lawyers are secondguessing whether the wisest strategy was chosen last winter for framing the issues in the two cases the Court decided this month on public aid to parochial schools One case involved a nationwide federally financed remedial program for impoverished children in both public or parochial schools The other involved a local program of aid to parochial schools in Grand Rapids Mich The Administration argued in behalf of both although there was no Federal involvement in the Grand Rapids program The cases were similar but they did have differences At argument some Justices were openly searching for a basis for saving the highly regarded Federal program even if Grand Rapids could not pass constitutional muster But the Government lawyers refused to concede any distinction between the two programs insisting that both were equally meritorious and leaving the Court little choice but to let the two stand or fall together Both were ruled unconstitutional by votes of 5 to 4 Some Justice Department lawyers say the Federal program might have survived had the Administration tailored its arguments to winning that one case rather than holding out for the broadest possible endorsement of parochial aid The Administration filed another assertive but little noticed brief a few weeks ago on affirmative action The Administration is asking the Court to declare unconstitutional a collective bargaining agreement between the Jackson Mich school board and the nearly all white teachers union under which black teachers were protected against layoffs in order to increase their number in the school system The brief argues that the racially based misfortune that befell 10 white teachers who were briefly laid off offended both the fundamental 14th Amendment principle of equal treatment for all persons regardless of race and our republics basic moral vision of the unity of all mankind Two lower Federal courts upheld the plan The Supreme Court has ruled twice on the constitutionality of governmental preferences for members of racial minorities and twice albeit with some ambiguity it sustained the concept Very closely divided the Justices are more inclined to inch than to leap through this particular minefield Whether the Administrations highly charged rhetoric is the approach most likely to achieve its goals remains to be seen But no one can doubt where the Administration stands
TV WEEKEND;   HBO PRESENTS WHOOPI GOLDBERG,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/theater/tv-weekend-hbo-presents-whoopi-goldberg.html,HOME BOX OFFICE the paycable channel has not been partial to taping stage productions preferring instead to focus on such special live material as comedy performances With Whoopi Goldberg Direct From Broadway which is having its premiere tomorrow at 10 PM HBO has managed to get both This hourlong production was taped last March at the Lyceum Theater where Whoopi Goldberg in a production supervised by Mike Nichols had been holding forth in a onewoman show since the previous October The television sampling directed by Thomas Schlamme was produced by Whoop Inc in association with Broadway Video and DIR Broadcasting Miss Goldberg is an actress who like Lily Tomlin uses comedy to create a gallery of special characters Her people can be very funny and they have a habit not always ingratiating of dipping into pathos for a moment or two The mixture can work but not infrequently the balance goes slightly  but decidedly off One ends up admiring Whoopi Goldberg but wishing that she would get a bit tougher about her material The program opens with Miss Goldberg arriving at the theater backstage and popping her head into several dressing rooms to say hello to the five characters she will be impersonating on stage As the curtain goes up an advisory is offered about the performances containing some strong language something that is quickly made clear as the star assumes the guise and manner of Fontaine a street junkie with a colorful rap Strung out and moving with calculated ease Fontaine explains genially that Ive got the freedom that allows me to cruise  Im a thief Hes a beautiful character part jive talk and part serious student of American history from the 20s to the present Getting together enough earnings to travel to Europe Fontaine finds himself in Amsterdam visiting the house of Anne Frank Thats when the pathos begins to sneak into his act disconcertingly Before you know it Miss Goldberg is milking the audience for applause by mentioning Shelley Winters and her Oscar for the film version of The Diary of Anne Frank Fontaine gets not only more serious but also more properly articulate Unfortunately he also gets lost The other people in Whoopi Goldbergs repertory are a California teenager whose surfing world is totally great OK until she gets pregnant Im like totally PG she says Like in a movie her puzzled friends and family ask a preteenage black girl who uses a white shirt to simulate the long blond hair that will someday get her on Love Boat the feisty woman from Kingston Jamaica who becomes the special companion of an elderly white tourist who resembles an old raisin and a crippled young woman with a badly contorted body who has met a young man who thinks she is a very foxy chick and is talking seriously about marriage In each instance of course there is an emotional payoff The silly pregnant teenager becomes the victim of a botched abortion The woman from the islands finds the happy ending of a substantial inheritance the audience applauds The crippled woman discovers that normal must be in the eye of the beholder more applause Whoopi Goldberg is reaching for something special in her act She grasps it often enough to merit close attention Patricia Highsmith On Mystery Writing Thirtyfive years and 16 novels after her first book Strangers on a Train Patricia Highsmith remains as fascinated with the idea of crime as with actual criminal acts Although readers already know whodunit in a Highsmith mystery her books hold their interest because she continues to plumb the psychic depths No less than Graham Greene described her as the poet of apprehension rather than fear But Miss Highsmith seems less able to discuss those ideas or concerns than to write about them as evidenced in Patricia Highsmith the onehour program on The Creative Edge series tomorrow at 9 PM on Channel 13 The program is worth viewing if only for the opportunity to see and hear Miss Highsmith an American who has lived for years in France Beyond that the producerdirector Jack Bond has skillfully interspersed parts of an interview with the author with scenes from Ripley Under Ground her 1970 mystery novel about art forgery in England At one point in a scene in a hotel hallway she and the unidentified interviewer pass her psychotic fictional character Tom Ripley played by Jonathan Kent who is on his way to break into her room Strolling in the garden Miss Highsmith says that she wrote her first Ripley book in six months and that it was so easy I felt that Ripley was writing it Whereupon the film cuts back to her room where Ripley sitting before a typewriter begins writing Ripley Under Ground The program produced for London Weekend Television would have benefited from more biographical information about its subject and a less graphic display of Ripley bashing in the skull of the American art buyer Murchison played by Lee Montague The squeamish are likely to squirm when Ripley cremates another of his victims Bernard Stephen Tiller But its major shortcoming is Miss Highsmiths inability to articulate clearly during the program her thoughts about Ripley about murder or about the sanctity of human life Edwin McDowell
CRUCIAL ELECTION LOOMS AT FEMINIST CONVENTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/us/crucial-election-looms-at-feminist-convention.html,A heated presidential election between two of the countrys bestknown feminists will be the major attraction when the National Organization for Women opens its annual threeday convention here Friday The election pits Judy Goldsmith 46 years old the incumbent president of NOW against Eleanor Smeal 45 her predecessor as president who is now a political consultant in Washington The 2500 convention delegates will vote Saturday night The contest contains a number of dramatic elements Mrs Goldsmith was Mrs Smeals candidate to succeed her at the convention in 1982 Mrs Smeals decision to challenge her onetime friend and ally has resulted in a bitter campaign Betty Friedan a founder of NOW who is considered the mother of the modern womens movement added to the controversy when she publicly criticized Mrs Smeals decision to run To me it seems just a case of somebody missing power she said Schisms Disclaimed Both candidates say publicly that the election will not result in any permanent schisms in the group which with about 250000 members is the nations largest and most important feminist organization The election wont hurt NOW Mrs Goldsmith said in an interview We will be 20 years old next year and weve gone through a lot Were so strongly unified around the issues and that is the operative reality for the members Mrs Smeal said she thought the campaign had been good for the organization because it has increased the involvement of our activists She added that if she lost she had no plans to start a separate organization with a philosophy closer to hers Both women acknowledged that they did not have many ideological differences Where they differ is in their approach to womens issues a difference that could be characterized as coalition versus confrontation How Candidates Differ Mrs Goldsmith a tall understated former professor of English literature prefers lobbying and coalitionbuilding Mrs Smeal a small bluntspeaking former Pittsburgh housewife favors demonstrations and other actions that generate publicity for NOW However Mrs Goldsmith seemed to have adopted one of Mrs Smeals tactics by planning to open the convention Friday with the announcement of an abortion rights mobilization campaign called the NOW Campaign to Save Womens Lives One Million Strong She said members would spend six months collecting a million signatures from Americans who favor the right of women to make their own decision about abortion and who oppose the antiabortion activities of conservative political and religious groups Mrs Goldsmith said the signatures would be presented to the nations policy makers next Jan 22 the 13th anniversary of the Supreme Courts decision in the Roe v Wade case legalizing abortion in the United States Mrs Smeal asked whether she thought the announcement of the campaign was a move to call attention to Mrs Goldsmith replied One reason I decided to run for President was to get NOW to increase its activism Im delighted its having this effect Plan on Abortion Issue Her own plan to publicize the abortion issue she said at a candidates forum in New York last month was to stage a march of 200000 people on Washington saying we will not tolerate prohibitions on birth control and abortion Among the candidates other areas of disagreement have been the organizations finances its membership figures the extent of its involvement with the Democratic Party and how to keep the alive the drive for a Federal equal rights amendment Mrs Goldsmith has said that she believes changes in the membership of state legislatures are needed before another attempt is made to pass the amendment Mrs Smeal says she wants to keep ERA awareness alive by supporting the passage of a model state amendment in a referendum in Vermont in 1986 If its successful we could move it to other states she said Mrs Goldsmith according to people in the organization who are watching the campaign closely is thought to be leading in the race for the twoyearterm in the 51000ayear presidency Jennifer Brown president of New York City NOW said her chapter had voted to endorse Mrs Goldsmith Judy has done an excellent job in helping local chapters organize for womens rights in their own communities she said If Ellie is elected Im afraid NOW would once again focus on national actions in Washington Mrs Smeal however believes the race will be close mainly because of what she calls her grassroots support What many people including Betty Friedan dont realize she said is that it wasnt my idea to run There was a lobbying campaign by many people in NOW to get me to run The convention will also include speeches by Sally K Ride the first American woman in space Lois DeBerry a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives who is president of the National Caucus of Black Women Flo Hyman a member of the United States volleyball team which won a silver medal at the 1984 Olympic Games and Eleanor Holmes Norton professor of law at Georgetown University who is a former chairman of the Federal Equal

U.S. WOMEN SPLIT WITH DELEGATES IN KENYA,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/20/style/us-women-split-with-delegates-in-kenya.html,As Forum 85 the informal gathering of more than 10000 women here ended today with jubilation singing and dancing American women were stunned to hear a member of the United States delegation to the official conference question the mandate of the Plan of Action adopted at the 1977 Houston womens conference The plan a national declaration of equality for American women was drafted in response to the United Nations Decade for Women which began in 1976 Alan L Keyes the only male member of the American delegation to the official United Nations Decade for Women conference which closes the decade and which will continue through July 26 said at a press briefing today Well you know one would have to raise some questions about how much the Houston Plan of Action represented the women of the United States Mr Keyes appointed by President Reagan as the United States representative at the United Nations Economic and Social Council with the rank of ambassador added I think that the American people have made it pretty clear that their support of President Reagan and his policies is fairly strong and despite the usual efforts that have gone on within our constitutional system to get them to change their minds they were rather resounding in their lack of desire to do so The National Plan of Action is the official set of recommendations adopted at the 1977 National Womens Conference in Houston That conference Congressionally mandated and funded brought together women from every state and territory as part of the Decade for Women A number of American women here even those who had refrained from criticizing the United States delegation previously out of a concern for unity reacted angrily It was one of the most representative meetings ever held in our country said former Representative Bella S Abzug presiding officer of the Houston convention The Plan of Action adopted was voted in by the democratically assembled delegates Other women such as Arvonne S Fraser senior fellow at the Hubert H Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota who was a delegate to both the international Decade for Women conferences at Mexico City and Copenhagen and to the Houston conference said that the Plan of Action enabled women to get equal rights legislation passed The Plan of Action was the cumulative efforts of 50 states said Mrs Fraser American women at the state national and local level have been proceeding to carry it out and have even moved beyond it Has Ambassador Keyes read it Mr Keyess remarks graphically pointed out some sharp differences between the official United States delegation and many of the 2000 American women now in Nairobi The division between the Reagan Administrations policy and a majority of the American women here is also reflected in a petition that was circulated by the Womens Coalition for Nairobi a multiracial umbrella group of American representatives of religious peace and civilrights organizations The petition which was signed by 1200 Americans calls on the delegation to support a reduction in the United States military budget a curb on the activities of transnational corporations that adversely affect womens employment and conditions of work a guarantee of the right of women to equal pay for work of comparable value as well as the right to full employment and a guaranteed income the elimination of all forms of racial oppression and discrimination against women among other issues Signers included veteran American feminists such as Mrs Abzug Betty Friedan and Dorothy Height president of the National Council of Negro Women Many Americans who attended Forum 85 leave disappointed that they were not given the chance to exchange views with Maureen Reagan head of the United States delegation and Mr Keyes the only two members of the delegation who appeared to be willing to answer questions on substantive foreignpolicy issues In conversation caucuses with other delegations the American delegation stuck to four issues it said reflected the unique concerns of women literacy refugees women in developing countries and domestic violence In the giveandtake at briefings by some American delegates to other Americans attending Forum 85 the latter group expressed many other areas of concern For example women at Forum 85 wanted to discuss the links between domestic violence and the arms race and the delegations refusal to issue a policy statement on family planning Suggestions on Official Document They also made suggestions on the official United Nations document under discussion  to strengthen the paragraphs on apartheid for example It became clear to women attending the Forum that the United States delegation represented the views of the Reagan Administration on womens issues Those who had fought hard for the proposed equal rights amendment objected to the official speech given by Miss Reagan in which she said that all legal barriers to political equality have long since been eliminated in the United States Stephanie Clohesy executive director of the National Organization for Womens Legal Defense and Education Fund called the Reagan speech total double talk in terms of the substantive issues that are of concern to women Her organization issued a pointbypoint refutation of the speech Some of the Americans who represent nongovernmental organizations are monitoring the slowmoving complicated maneuverings of the official conference Those who represent organizations with consultative status at the United Nations have the right to give speeches submit resolutions and statements through their delegations attend United Nations meetings and receive official documents If there was one point of common ground among many of the delegates and the American women attending the Forum it was distress at the decision of the Reagan Administration to ask the Supreme Court to overrule its 1973 decision on abortion on the grounds that its principles are so sweeping as to block state and local efforts to limit abortions Some members of the American delegation only learned about the Administrations move filed in a brief on Monday in press reports here I absolutely disagree with the Reagan Administration on this issue Carrie Francke a United States delegate told a briefing of Americans At a party for the press Mary A Grefe another delegate said I support right of choice I certainly support right of choice Even Lois Haight Herrington a delegate and an Assistant Attorney General who characterized the Reagan Administration as neutral on the legality of abortion said I would be apoplectic if I thought it was purposely timed to coincide with this conference Most of the Americans will head home over the weekend Many will leave in a spirit of commonality with other women exhilarated by their own agendas to begin implementing what they learned here in the last 10 days
MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY;   ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REVERAL ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/21/weekinreview/major-news-in-summary-administration-seeks-reveral-on-abortion.html,Restricting access to abortion is prominent among President Reagans social policy goals Returning to the states powers that he views as usurped by the Federal Government is one of his political aims Last week with the personal approval of the President the Justice Department brought the social and political agendas together asking the Supreme Court to overrule itself and return jurisdiction to decide abortion cases to the condition in which it was before 1973 That was the year of the Roe v Wade ruling in which the Court said that a womens decision to end a pregnancy was part of a fundamental right of privacy protected by the 14th Amendment Before then women who obtained abortions and doctors who performed the procedure faced criminal penalties in many states One of the two multifaceted state laws supported by the Administration in the brief it filed with the Supreme Court last week holds subject to criminal prosecution doctors who cause the abortion of a viable fetus and defines a fetus as a human being from fertilization to birth The other requires women be warned that an abortion may have unforeseen and detrimental physical and psychological effects Federal appeals courts have declared both state laws unconstitutional the first from Illinois on the ground that it forces the physician to act as the mouthpiece for the states theory of life and the second from Pennsylvania because its restrictions on abortion are similar to those imposed by the City Council of Akron Ohio which were struck down by the Supreme Court in 1983 The Administration stopped short then of asking that Roe v Wade be overruled urging only heavy deference to the preferences of legislators The emphatic tone of the 63 decision in Akron makes it unlikely that the Justices will now agree with the Administration that Roe v Wade is so far flawed and such a source of instability in the law that the Court should abandon it

U.S. ASSAILED ON POPULATION AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/22/world/us-assailed-on-population-aid.html,Actions by Congress and the Reagan Administration aimed at reducing or eliminating money for population control projects sponsored by the United Nations could hinder familyplanning programs in more than 100 developing nations United Nations officials and diplomats say The House of Representatives passed a foreign aid bill last week that would allow the Administration to end contributions to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities The United States contributes about onethird of the organizations annual budget and officials said the loss of that money would devastate programs in Africa and Asia particularly Passage of the House bill which is similar to one approved earlier by the Senate was the latest in a series of actions that have cast doubts on the future of the fund In March the Reagan Administration withheld 10 million of the American contribution of 46 million to the population fund for fiscal year 1985 which ends Sept 30 asserting that China one of the nations aided by the fund was including coerced abortions in its population control programs Antiabortion Activists Since Mr Reagan took office antiabortion activists have been lobbying to end Government aid to groups that support programs involving abortion The 46 million American pledge to the fund is about 16 percent of the 290 million that the United States allocated for 1985 to overseas population control programs The balance is for programs with other governments and in grants to private family planning groups The United States decision to withhold money from the population fund and the singling out of China provoked a strong reaction from the Chinese at the United Nations and elsewhere Before leaving Peking last week for a visit to Canada President Li Xiannian of China criticized the House vote and called the Administrations actions interference in Chinas internal affairs Mr Li will begin a state visit to Washington on Monday Population fund administrators have repeatedly denied that any of the programs supported by the fund involve coerced abortions and they have privately expressed consternation at the Administratons policies US Money Already Segregated American contributions to the United Nations fund are already put into a segregated account that cannot be used for programs in China or for projects in such countries as Cuba and Nicaragua Dr Sharon Camp vice president of the Population Crisis Committee a Washingtonbased lobby for population control efforts said The Chinese are concerned not only that their name is being smeared in the United States but also that their relationship with other third world countries is jeopardized by these moves At the recent fund review meetings delegates from developing countries voiced support for the organizations activities and warned of serious consequences if financial support drops
WOMAN IN THE NEWS;NEW HEAD OF NOW PREFERS ACTIVISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/22/us/woman-in-the-news-new-head-of-now-prefers-activism.html,Eleanor Smeal won an upset victory over Judy Goldsmith as president of the National Organization for Women today and the first thing she did when she met the press was to put her arms around her husband and two children Feminists arent supposed to do this sort of thing she said smiling but why not Her husband Charles she said had been her chief vote counter and had predicted she would win by one more vote than she actually got and her two children Tod who is 20 years old and Lori 17 have been behind me all the way Mrs Smeal 45 who served as NOWs president from 1977 to 1982 defeated Mrs Goldsmith 839 to 703 The election results which were supposed to be announced at midnight Saturday were not made public until 1 PM today A faulty sample ballot caused the elections committee to throw out the first 400 votes and start the election over Mrs Smeals victory seemed to indicate that the majority of NOW voters prefer her confrontational approach to womens issues Under Mrs Goldsmiths twoandahalf year presidency the 250000member organization sought to accomplish its goals mainly through lobbying and coalition building Back Into the Streets Weve been pretty good  we tried that last year  but now its time to go back into the streets Mrs Smeal said She said her two most immediate goals after taking the 55000ayear office Sept 1 would be to organize an abortion rights march in Washington next March and a campaign to pass the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1985 which among other things would restore prohibitions on sex discrimination at institutions receiving Federal aid Asked what would happen if the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 decision that legalized abortion as the Reagan Administration requested last week Mrs Smeal said Youll see this movement explode in size Backs Goldsmith Initiative Mrs Smeal said she would continue the campaign for abortion rights that was announced here Friday by Mrs Goldsmith which will include rallies and a petition campaign Mrs Smeal said she also plans to begin a recruitment effort on college campuses start a paid advertising campaign for NOW and work toward passage of a model state equal rights amendment in a referendum in Vermont scheduled for 1986 I want to take on the enemy and one referendum after another she said You cant keep the ERA on the back burner You have to keep it alive Asked why she thought she had defeated Mrs Goldsmith who had been her vice presidentexecutive at NOW and who was her handpicked candidate to succeed her in 1982 Mrs Smeal said Because people thought we would be a real shot in the arm for the movement She added that she hoped Mrs Goldsmith would remain active in NOW as a major speaker or statesman for the movement After the election Mrs Goldsmith issued a statement offering her full support in building the strongest possible organization to continue to move the womens rights agenda forward A Lot of Kick Left Mrs Smeal grew visibly angry when asked if NOW should be trying to recruit more young leaders If I was a male leader Id be considered part of the youth crowd like Gary Hart she said I may have a little gray but Ive got a lot of kick left The daughter of Italian immigrants she was born July 30 1939 and grew up as Eleanor Marie Cutri in Erie Pa Her father was an insurance agent and her mother was a housewife Eleanor the only daughter was the youngest of four children At Duke University she majored in political science was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1961 with a major in political science She also holds a masters degree in political science from the University of Florida and has completed all the requirements for a doctorate there except for a dissertation Mrs Smeal and her husband a former metallurgical researcher both joined NOW on the same day in 1970 They were living in an affluent suburb of Pittsburgh at the time and Mrs Smeal in her early days in NOW often referred to herself as a Pittsburgh housewife First Involvement in Feminism She said she first became interested in feminism in 1969 when she spent a year recovering from a back problem and read about the lives of two early suffragists Susan B Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton They inspired me to want to do something to help the modern womens movement she said Mrs Smeal was the first president of NOWs Pennsylvania chapter and served on NOWS national board from 1973 to 1977 before being elected to her first term as president She did not run for a third term in 1982 because NOWs constitution limits its presidents to two consecutive terms Since 1983 Mrs Smeal has been working with her husband in a political consulting concern in Washington called Eleanor Smeal and Associates The family lives in a twostory brick home in Fairfax Va Charlie does most of the cooking according to a friend Molly Yard Ellie would just as soon never cook another meal in her life Her only hobby according to her husband is reading She reads everything but fiction he said She reads to learn

A No-Win Proposal On Abortion Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/25/opinion/a-nowin-proposal-on-abortion-rights.html,No matter where you stand on the debate over abortion Roe v Wade is a case that is difficult to like The prolife groups obviously oppose the United States Supreme Courts 1973 decision upholding a limited right to end pregnancy But not even the prochoice camp has been fully satisfied because the Court cast its decision largely in terms of a physicians right to prescribe treatment for a patient rather than as a firm endorsement of a womans right to control her body Constitutional scholars on both sides of the debate have criticized the Court for pinning its ruling to the medical question of when a fetus can survive outside the womb  a tactic that effectively built obsolescence into constitutional doctrine As technology improves doctors ability to keep fetuses alive at earlier stages the right to an abortion inevitably contracts The Reagan Administration has now proposed an even less satisfactory resolution of the controversy In a brief filed last week the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to nullify Roe v Wade and return regulation of abortion to the states Feminists and other prochoice advocates are disturbed by the possibility that the states may be given free rein to restrict or outlaw abortion something most of the states did as recently as 12 years ago Opponents of abortion will realize that the Administrations current position does not really satisfy their concerns Whether one believes in a womans right to choose when to have a child or a fetuss right to be born the Justice Departments alternative is unacceptable for the simple reason that it does not protect either right Tossing the problem back to the states as the Administration urges would do nothing more than delegate the fate of mothers and unborn children alike to shifting majorities in 50 legislatures The rights of women would be trampled in some states the rights of the unborn sacrificed in others Regardless of whether one sides with the woman or the fetus or denounces any approach to the abortion problem that pits pregnant women against their unborn children  treating the issue as one properly resolved by a legislative vote is the least legitimate alternative Abortion is not merely a policy issue it lies at the intersection of powerful conflicting rights Fundamental rights unlike liquor regulations or traffic laws should not vary from state to state If a woman has a basic right to decide whether or not to have children shouldnt she have this right regardless of her state of residence And if the right to life is sacred shouldnt it be just as protected in Los Angeles as in Little Rock During this countrys debate over outlawing slavery Abraham Lincoln wisely said the nation could not last long halfslave and halffree The glaring flaw of the Reagan Administrations proposal to overturn Roe v Wade is that it treats both the fetuss claim to life and womens claim to choose when to give birth as issues of discretionary policy exercized by individual states not as matters of fundamental constitutional right No matter which side one takes it is absurd to argue that the right not to be aborted or the right to control ones reproductive choices are more akin to the privilege of betting on horses or driving a car  activities the states may regulate than to the right to vote or to own property or to worship in the church of ones choice  freedoms the Constitution guarantees to all Americans in every state We have a Bill of Rights precisely for the purpose of insulating our basic liberties from the vicissitudes of the democratic process Determining the scope of such fundamental liberties and resolving conflicts among them are tasks for the Supreme Court to discharge by application of constitutional principles The Justice Department has now urged the Court to abdicate this responsibility and leave the abortion debate to individual states where it would be resolved by counting legislative noses For an Administration whose Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d recently accused the Supreme Court of making policy choices rather than articulations of constitutional principle its position is as ironic as it is untenable
'We Punish the World',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/25/opinion/we-punish-the-world.html,Rampant population growth underlies the third worlds poverty and poses a major longterm threat to political stability and our planets resource base Thats what Secretary of State Shultz told a Congressional committee two years ago But Mr Shultzs boss doesnt share his concern On the contrary the Reagan Administration is working hard against the programs that would defuse the population bomb Only sensible and prompt action by a HouseSenate conference can derail this destructive policy At last summers World Population Conference the United States the major contributor to international familyplanning programs announced it would try to end aid to any agencies that so much as mention abortion But population experts protested that would threaten poor countries holding their population control efforts hostage to abortion politics No matter American representatives said Runaway population growth does not hinder progress but actually promotes it If the abortion rule constricts population programs that would do the world a favor The Agency for International Development then cut off aid to International Planned Parenthood the primary network for family planning programs all over the world A small part of its funds none of them Federal  pays for abortionrelated activities As a result Planned Parenthood had to cancel programs in 18 African countries among them Ethiopia Last week AID made family planning even more difficult Any grantees who offer only the rhythm method of birth control need no longer provide information about other birth control methods when asked Congress meanwhile has stirred more confusion in the name of protesting coercive abortions that reputedly take place in China Whether they do or not is a distressing question but one that is irrelevant to population control by acceptable humane means The Senate has approved an amendment to the foreign aid authorization bill proposed by Senator Nancy Kassebaum to deny any population funds for programs in China Senator Jesse Helms would go much further denying all American support to population agencies working in any country said to permit coerced abortions  even if no Federal funds are used in the country Under that proposal even the UNs population agency would lose American money A third amendment adopted by the House would permit the President to deny Federal funds to any government UN agency or private agency because of the way they use their money whether or not it comes from Uncle Sam This means that the President a foe of abortion could on his own cut off all US population aid Will Congress finally settle on some more reasonable population policy At the moment thats up to a conference committee meeting this week on the foreign aid bill Senator Kassebaum is on that committee and since hers is the most levelheaded of the amendments it is to her that the public must look for a way out of this morass The worlds population is now doubling every 30 years  and most of that growth is taking place in the poorest countries Drought poor land use and overpopulation have already produced catastrophe in Ethiopia Unless Congress can finally halt the Administrations wrongheaded Mexico City policy Ethiopia may be only a harbinger
"Court-Packing, Reagan-Style",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/26/opinion/courtpacking-reaganstyle.html,President Reagan has long said he admires Franklin D Roosevelt Now hes repeating Mr Roosevelts worst mistake and realizing the fears of his own critics by threatening to pack the Federal courts with judges committed to a narrow ideological agenda The latest volley in the Administrations crusade against the courts came in an address by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d to the American Bar Association He declared that recent United States Supreme Court decisions had departed from the original intention of the Founding Fathers who he said would find the views of todays judges bizarre But even more ominous than the speech is evidence that the Administration and some of its Congressional supporters are moving from courtbashing to courtpacking The opportunities are certainly there Whereas Mr Roosevelt asked for and was denied special legislation to pack the Supreme Court Mr Reagan need only fill existing vacancies to load the courts with likeminded judges Five of nine Supreme Court justices are over 76 years old and oneseventh of all Federal judgeships are vacant The Administrations judicial appointments already include many who are committed to extreme conservatism and unusually young in the words of Herman Schwartz professor of law at American University And while denying he is imposing ideological litmus tests Mr Meese says he is seeking nominees who believe in the sanctity of human life  shorthand for opposing the Supreme Courts 1973 ruling upholding womens abortion rights In this respect his language parallels that of the 1984 Republican platform which called for the appointment of judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life Several of the Administrations staunchest allies in the Senate have insisted that judicial nominees pledge allegiance not only to the social agenda in the platform but also to a narrow viewpoint on political economic and even religious issues Not long ago three Republican Senators Jeremiah Denton of Alabama John P East of North Carolina and Orrin G Hatch of Utah forced two nominees for Federal judgeships to complete an eightpage questionnaire asking among other things whether they agreed that affirmative action should be cut back and whether the National Labor Relations Act was unconstitutional Much of the strategic coordination and intellectual ammunition for these ideological screenings comes from an influential New Right thinktank the Center for Judicial Studies Headed by James McClellan a former counsel to Senators Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina Hatch and East the Centers board includes two leading aides to Mr Meese special assistant Grover Rees 3d and counselor Kenneth Cribb In a recent interview with the John Birch Societys magazine Mr McClellan boasted that he is conducting interviews to try to find those best qualified to serve on the Supreme Court To pass muster with Mr McClellan prospective judges may have to support a philosophy that enshrines states rights In Mr McClellans view the fundamental problem with 20th Century constitutional law is the doctrine of incorporation which holds that state governments as well as the Federal Government must uphold the Bill of Rights Mr McClellan denounces this doctrine as the great seedbearer of Federal judicial power In his address Mr Meese joined Mr McClellan in attacking the doctrine of incorporation which he called intellectually shaky While Mr Meese condemned it only as it applied to churchstate issues his broader implications were not reassuring If state governments may disregard the First Amendments barrier between church and state why cant they also disregard the rest of the Bill of Rights and abolish jury trials restrict free speech threaten other individual freedoms The American people refused to allow one of our most popular Presidents FDR to tamper with the Constitution Attorney General Meese and the President he serves should think twice before trying to pack the courts with judges pledged to repeal the 20th Century

NOW'S PRESIDENT: ASSESSING THE ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/27/style/now-s-president-assessing-the-election.html,As the smoke cleared this week after one of the most heated presidential elections in the 19year history of the National Organization for Women NOW leaders tried to assess Eleanor Smeals upset victory over Judy Goldsmith Among the factors contributing to Mrs Smeals victory they said were personality differences between the two candidates a faulty sample ballot the lastminute decision by a NOW officer to endorse Mrs Smeal a legal votebrokering system and a surprisingly vitriolic final campaign speech by Mrs Goldsmith Before the election in New Orleans Sunday Mrs Goldsmith a moderate was believed to be leading She was the incumbent seeking her second term and NOW presidents had traditionally served two consecutive twoyear terms Members of NOWs 35member national board and its state coordinators supported her by a 2 to 1 margin And she appeared to have more supporters at the conventions plenary sessions Yet Mrs Smeal who had served as president from 1977 to 1982 defeated Mrs Goldsmith by the surprisingly wide margin of 839 to 703 Even Mrs Smeal who campaigned as an activist who would take NOW members back into the streets seemed pessimistic about her chances before the results were announced Sunday In her suite in the Fairmont Hotel she told her downcast supporters to prepare for defeat  then you wont feel so bad if we lose This week the 45yearold Mrs Smeal sounded as though she thought she was going to win all along Im a very good vote counter she said and judging from what our state coordinators told us about the vote count coming in I was ahead from the day the convention opened The only thing we worried about she added was large numbers of people we didnt know about coming in GrassRoots Support Mrs Smeal a Washington political consultant said a major reason for her victory was her grassroots support I was drafted by a large faction in our organization she said When I started I had commitments from some very large states including Pennsylvania Florida and California and all those people worked very very hard She said she thought she had won some votes when Lois Galgay Reckitt NOWs incumbent vice presidentexecutive decided at the last minute to abandon her neutral stance and endorse Mrs Smeal The Goldsmith campaign Mrs Smeal added badly misjudged the dissatisfaction of members who wanted a more confrontational approach to womens issues Noting that Mrs Goldsmith had been quoted as saying that further attempts to pass the proposed equal rights amendment during the Reagan Administration would be an exercise in futility she said I cant tell you what that did to our activists many of whom would give their lives for the ERA Mrs Goldsmith described herself as surprised by the elections outcome She said she thought a major reason she had lost was that Ellies rhetorical style was more effective in the overheated environment of a national NOW conference She said her chances had also been hurt when the elections committee threw out the first 505 votes and started the election over again The problem was a faulty sample ballot put out by the Smeal campaign That gave them several more hours to lobby Mrs Goldsmith said Asked if she thought the faulty ballot had been distributed intentionally she replied I have not accused anyone of that type of conscious and cynical manipulation and I wouldnt but it does seem to go beyond coincidence Its not a mistake that would be easily made Mrs Smeal denied that her side had deliberately put out the inaccurate ballot Patricia Ireland a Miami lawyer who served as Mrs Smeals campaign manager said a key to the victory had been the Smeal campaigns ability to attract a majority of the 10 percent of the delegates who were uncommitted We picked up a lot of momentum during the convention which helped to draw in a fairly substantial number of the uncommitted people she said Much of that momentum was provided by Mrs Smeals campaign workers at the convention who appeared to be more exuberant than Mrs Goldsmiths supporters They also had more eyecatching campaign paraphernalia including raspberry Tshirts with the name Ellie on the front buttons that read I H L E and professionally printed raspberrycolored campaign posters Perhaps as a result Mrs Smeals reported campaign expenses were 18000 compared with Mrs Goldsmiths 14000 She Can Inspire You Linda Bowker president of NOW New Jersey said she thought Mrs Smeal had won because her dynamism revived memories of a time when NOW was more involved in political activism Ellie got to peoples guts she said She can inspire you to do things other people cant like giving her your last dollar or staying up all night working and then starting out again the next day That quality is the reason she has never lost an election Some of Mrs Goldsmiths supporters  including her campaign manager Merry Demarest of Corvallis Ore  said they thought Mrs Goldsmith was hurt by the votebrokering system that is officially sanctioned in NOW elections Mrs Goldsmith disagreed that brokering might have cost her the election It was done by both sides she said and I dont think it effectively made a difference Several NOW leaders said they thought Mrs Goldsmiths final campaign speech in which she uncharacteristically attacked her opponent in hardhitting language had lost her some votes She accused Mrs Smeal of among other things duplicity character assassination and a wardboss political mentality Mrs Goldsmith 46 a former professor of English literature seemed to be trying at the last minute to reverse her image as a president who preferred coalitionbuilding to one who might be comfortable with her opponents combative style Deliverywise it was probably the best speech of Judys career said Kim Gandy of New Orleans MidSouth regional director of NOW But its content lost her votes Theres a strong feeling in NOW that you dont attack another woman that way Mrs Smeal will assume the 55000ayear presidency on Sept 1 She said she would begin planning an abortion rights march on Washington Mrs Goldsmith said she was considering running for Congress from her home state Wisconsin She said she would maintain cordial relations with NOW but with no official duties
The Muppie-izing of America,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/28/opinion/the-muppie-izing-of-america.html,Yuppies are nearly muppies Their exchange of the y for the m also promises major changes for America It is a critical time in the lives of these young urban professionals who were born in the postwar baby boom Within a year the first of them will turn 40 That means they become middleaged urban perhaps suburban professionals During this season of life as a rule the meorientation of ones 20s and 30s diminishes and an awareness of others rises The focus on career tends to expand further to include home hearth and community and the drive for success is tempered by growing sensitivity to the wellbeing of future generations For many the old dreams  some achieved others not  are traded for new visions to guide the future Because of the number of babyboomers  they constitute 35 percent of the total population  changes in their lives will alter the contours of our society as they did earlier in their lives In the 1960s when they entered the period of rebellion typical of teenagers America assumed some of the same characteristics The nation was described as divided fragmented alienated angry When the babyboomers grew older married and began rearing families their interests shifted to traditional concerns  careers material goods And traditional notions of success America was seen as a harddriving and running successoriented selfindulgent nation Now America is likely to be perceived as a country in metamorphosis  a country whose spirit of community is resurgent The meism will diminish in favor of a renewed sense of altruism There will be less talk about having it all and more about giving and public responsibility The accent will shift from a preoccupation with the hereandnow to a concern for tomorrow The nations mood will seem less sybaritic we will enter a period of social consciousness The political consequences of this change could be dramatic Voting patterns are likely to shift sharply Consider a comparable group  those born after World War I During their teenage years they provided the radicals of the 1930s In their late 20s and early 30s they were the generation in a hurry the men in the gray flannel suits In overwhelming numbers they voted for Dwight D Eisenhower for President In their early 40s they changed Their votes went increasingly to John F Kennedys New Frontier and Lyndon B Johnsons Great Society As the babyboomers reach middle age they will vote increasingly for progressive political candidates The effect will be to overturn the Reagan majority which may vanish almost as quickly as it emerged A comparable change can be expected in the national political agenda We can anticipate a shift from todays personal politics  pocketbook issues school prayer abortion  to a more social agenda improving the cities assisting the poor helping the aged However none of this is likely to suggest nostalgia for a return to New Deal and Great Society politics nor a disregard of new problems such as the budget deficit and the plight of old industries Rather we are likely to see a new as yet uncrystallized progressive agenda Once again our nation is likely to find magic in President Kennedys call ask not what your country can do for you Ask what you can do for your country
STAGE VIEW;   THERE'S NOTHING DATED ABOUT THE BARD'S VIEW OF CHASTITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/28/arts/stage-view-there-s-nothing-dated-about-the-bard-s-view-of-chastity.html,The notion of chastity has a quaint ring to it It seems to belong to a distant time along with maiden aunts and antimacassars That may be one reason why Joseph Papp chose to play for laughs the Measure for Measure that opened Shakespeare in the Park this season the production closed last Sunday How after all could he expect a young audience bred on sexual permissiveness and the pill to take seriously a heroines efforts to defend her virginity from the vile intentions of a powerful male Done straight it might have struck them as Victorian melodrama Yet the characters and issues in Measure for Measure are no more dated than the Moral Majority A reminder of the plot The lenient duke of Vienna pretends to depart the city leaving mortality and mercy to his likely successor Lord Angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence No sooner is Angelo in power than as part of a crackdown on sexual promiscuity he condemns to death a feckless young man named Claudio for the rarely punished though much practiced crime of fornication Claudio has gotten his betrothed Juliet with child As the kindly provost laments All sects all ages smack of this vice and he to die for t Claudios sister Isabella a novice at a nunnery and the plays heroine comes to Angelo to beg for clemency and he proposes a bargain  her brothers life for her body for a night  which he does not intend to honor Now up to this point Angelo has had a reputation for surpassing honor His reputation means so much to him that after jilting his fiancee because she could not come up with the dowry he expected he sought to excuse himself by spreading rumors about her light ways Insult to injury Its the sort of thing that public men in all centuries have been known to do to keep themselves public and it sounds one of the great and undated themes of the play  commitment to others at the expense of ones own pleasures or even principles Isabella is a different case yet chillingly like her adversary She is no hypocrite but the value she places on her honor draws her into a perverse alliance with Angelo to send her brother to the executioner A key scene of the play reduced to slapstick in Mr Papps version comes when Isabella tells her beloved brother of Angelos proposition She expects or at any rate hopes that he noble lad will choose death rather than have his sister dishonored But he confesses that he prefers not to die Death he points out is a fearful thing Isabella is appalled but there is much about her own behavior that is appalling When Claudio pleads with her Sweet sister let me live she calls him a beast a faithless coward a dishonest wretch The play takes an unexpected shape Certainly Isabella is far more highminded than her brother and would probably sacrifice her life to save his honor yet he comes to appear more lifeaffirming than she Well she wouldnt be the first saint to detest life Claudio and his Juliet who want only to be left alone to live out their love are models of mental health compared to Isabella and Angelo Isabella has trouble pleading effectively for Claudios life because fundamentally she agrees with Angelos judgment that the young man has committed a grievous sin and ought to be punished There is a vice that most I do abhor And most desire should meet the blow of justice For which I would not plead but that I must For which I must not plead but that I am At war twixt will and will not Both Isabella and Angelo place an inordinate value on her virtue she will do anything to protect it he will do anything to capture it To be sure he simulates honor hers is the real thing But both are obsessed and willing to carry their obsession to a most bitter end There comes a point where the unrestrained pursuit of virtue and of vice merge in inhumanity Better it were goes the Isabella doctrine that a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die forever She comforts herself More than our own brother is our chastity A couple of centuries later this woman would have been talking about a fate worse than death Isabella and Angelo are candidates for the Moral Majority It would be rash to suggest that all Moral Majoritarians are either pureinheart or hypocrites What is certain about them is that they profess to know absolutely what sin is when it comes along and they are not satisfied to leave punishment to the hereafter but demand that the state do the job in the here and now One reason that Moral Majoritarians are sour on sex education is that they fear the freedom that knowledge of how to avoid pregnancy gives to young couples They have a point You dont have to sympathize with the sort of repression of sex and of information that the Moral Majority preaches to wonder about the consequences of sexual freedom for personal commitment Does the availability of the pill make it too easy for young couples to avoid emotional ties or does it permit them to make commitments when they are ready without being forced into them Does it enable couples to be more honest or only encourage them to be careless of one another The current figures on divorce and on singleparent households cannot be testaments to commitment Neoconservatives argue that social programs like Aid to Dependent Children have the effect of discouraging parents from staying together More equitable laws on divorce and nofault abortion seem to be loosening bonds well above the poverty line And perhaps the fits of selfabsorption to which middleclass youths are periodically prone has something to do with the difficulty many find in making permanent connections Shakespeare in this as in all his work is very much a commitment man The whores and pimps of Measure for Measure come off better than their repressors but the libertine Lucio like the straitlaced Angelo is punished for faithlessness Having gotten a woman of the town with child Lucio abandons her lest he be made a laughing stock Lucio and Angelo so different otherwise are kindred spirits in their refusal to honor or even acknowledge their commitments a far worse offense Shakespeare wants us to know than innocent fornication The most decent if improbable character in the play is the Duke Though he acknowledges that his reign has been overly permissive he is not out for the blood of every offender Call him liberal or conservative but never radical or reactionary He would probably be put off more by the Moral Majority than by loose living but he might find some way to keep pornographers within bounds The judgments that this duke ex machina hands out at the conclusion however when he delivers measure for measure by joining couples may leave todays audience uncertain that all has ended well this time Claudio and Juliet will probably get along all right The young fellow may stray occasionally and if his bride finds out shell be sensible enough not to make a fuss Everyone knows such loving couples Maybe in a fit of liberation Juliet will do some straying of her own That was not unheard of even in Elizabethan times If so lets hope that Claudio gives her the leniency he sought in vain from Angelo But what of Angelo and Mariana Todays audiences would probably find the ending more satisfying if Mariana showed some spunk and rejected the suitor who once so cruelly rejected her Mariana slam the door But for that we will have to await Ibsen And finally what of the duke himself and his Isabella She is the only strong woman in a play whose other female characters are tossed about by the whims of not very admirable men But her strength can be destructive Will she learn from the Duke to place a little less value on words like honor and virtue not to expect too much of mortals in general and to go slow in resorting to public power to enforce private morality Or will she hold fast to her religious principles and strong as she is impress her own super morality on the duke If so the people of his domain may have reason to regret she didnt wind up in that nunnery
WESTCHESTER JOURNAL;   SUIT DISMISSED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/28/nyregion/westchester-journal-suit-dismissed.html,Opponents of an abortion clinic in White Plains received a setback last week when a Supreme Court judge dismissed their suit to close the facility on technical grounds The cogent issue of jurisdiction has not been met Judge Louis C Palella said in his opinion dismissing the petition by four members of the Westchester Right to Life Committee against the New York State Department of Health the Westchester Womens Health Organization and Planned Parenthood of Westchester Judge Palella dismissed the petition because he said legal papers have not been served upon the Department of Health Without passing on the morality or immorality or legality or illegality of abortion this court has no alternative Judge Palellas decision read in part The State Health Department had previously issued a ruling that allowed the clinic to operate while its application was pending Petitioners in the case had asked that the State Health Department be made to enforce existing licensing requirements against a White Plains abortion clinic which they contend is unlicensed and therefore operating illegally The state while conceding that the facility does not have an operating license said an application was pending and that the Planned Parenthood organization was seeking to take over the clinic and operate it on its own The case has attracted considerable attention in part because the lawyer for the petitioners Lawrence Washburn had already gained national attention by intervening in the Baby Jane Doe case in which he tried unsuccessfully to force the parents of a severely handicapped child to order an operation for her

MANVILLE OFFERS ASBESTOS VICTIMS $2.5 BILLION FUND,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/03/business/manville-offers-asbestos-victims-2.5-billion-fund.html,The Manville Corporation after grappling for 15 years with thousands of asbestosrelated claims yesterday offered to pay victims 25 billion in the largest healthrelated settlement proposal ever made by an American company The offer calls for Manville to set up a fund to which shareholders would surrender half the value of their stock and the company would give up much of its projected earnings for the next 25 years To take effect the offer must be approved by stockholders unsecured creditors codefendants and current and future health claimants as well as a bankruptcy court Lawyers in the case said the prospects for approval within a year were good More Than 12 Billion Sought Approval would allow Manville to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings which it initiated on Aug 27 1982 after about 16500 lawsuits claiming more than 12 billion had been filed against it over asbestosrelated health problems The fiber once widely used in insulation appliances clothing and other products causes various debilitating or fatal lung diseases including asbestosis and cancer The diseases often take more than 20 years to develop and Manville once the worlds largest asbestos producer expected more than 60000 claims mainly from shipyard workers and others exposed to high concentrations of asbestos in the workplace The company had estimated its eventual obligation at 2 billion The largest fund previously set up by a company to settle health claims was 615 million by A H Robins  Company in connection with the Dalkon Shield an intrauterine birth control device associated with pelvic infections sterility and spontaneous abortions Stockholder Objections Seen I like the financial terms very much and I think the committees will go for it said Robert J Rosenberg a Manhattan lawyer and courtappointed representative for all presently known asbestos victims He said the biggest objection would be from stockholders but that bankruptcy law provided for approval of a reorganization plan even if one class objected The bankruptcy filing was intended to insulate the company from billions of dollars in claims while settlements were worked out It was considered a novel tactic because Manville was solvent But legal experts said yesterday that the plan had backfired The company had expected that the proceedings would enable it to pay the claims over a period a time as individual settlements were worked out without severe damage to its financial structure Instead however the company was required in the bankruptcy court to provide for all future claims based on statistical and epidemiologi cal analyses The company could have dealt with each claim year by year instead of accelerating all claims and wiping out the stockholders said one legal expert who declined to be identified Legal and financial experts yesterday uniformly said that the results of Manvilles bankruptcy move were bound to discourage other preemptive bankruptcies by companies expecting large health claims The settlement plan negotiated by Leon Silverman another Manhattan lawyer appointed by the bankruptcy court also obligates the forest products and mining company to pledge 20 percent of its annual profits indefinitely until all claims are settled Manvilles total cost to emerge from bankruptcy could thus well exceed 3 billion meaning severe financial damage to the company and its stockholders for years The company conceded that the proposal would be a severe financial hardship but that it would at least result in a viable operation that could emerge from bankruptcy in 12 to 18 months Only So Much Money It will have an adverse effect but there is only so much money and a lot of constituencies must be satisfied said Curtis B Linke a company spokesman Consider the alternative of perhaps the stockholders ending up with zero He added that the company would likely continue its nodividend policy set up just before the bankruptcy filing for some years The plan provides for a special trust fund to pay the asbestos claims The fund would include half of the companys 24 million shares of outstanding common stock Mr Linke said Manville would likely call in all of the stock and give back to each stockholder only half as many shares That means an investor stands to lose half the stock value immediately The company said the eventual loss to investors could be 80 percent if more claims were filed The stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at 7875 a share up 87 12 cents Some analysts suggested the rise reflected a belief the company would remain solvent The trust would also be financed initially with 315 million from insurance already obtained by the company 300 million in cash or other insurance the company expects to obtain and 200 million in cash and other receivables From the 4th through the 13th years after the plan is approved Manville would guarantee 75 million annually and from then to the 25th year up to 75 million a year would be paid if necessary Manvilles 1984 net income was 77 million The fund payments would likely be tax deductible and so would not result in dollarfordollar reductions in earnings the company said No Unsecured Creditors Paid Manville also agreed to pay unsecured creditors 250 million when the company emerges from bankruptcy and another 175 million to 250 million in the following three years None of the unsecured creditors have been paid since the bankruptcy filing Preferred stockholders also are in for losses Manville plans to exchange the 46 million outstanding shares of that stock for more junior preference stock for perhaps 85 million about 25 percent less than the current par value the company said Various parts of the plan were left unresolved lawyers fees a proposal not to pay unsecured creditors interest during the bankruptcy period and a precise claims formula Manville suggested that it be allowed to join an industry arbitration group called the Wellington Agreement to settle claims The plan also does not deal with the more than 80 billion in property damage claims against Manville by school districts and other parties that have had to remove asbestos from their buildings But lawyers involved in the case said the liability there would probably be relatively small perhaps 50 million After the approval by the Denver companys board its president Josh T Hulce said the plan provides a desirable alternative to tort litigation an equitable and efficient means of compensating the valid claims of all creditors and preserves Manville as a viable business But various legal experts yesterday said that unlike most bankruptcy reorganizations Manville would emerge financially weaker than when it entered Healthy solvent companies dont give up 50 percent of their equity Mr Rosenberg the plaintiffs lawyer said
MEESE AND HIS CANDOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/03/us/meese-and-his-candor.html,Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has outlined his thinking about the state of the Supreme Court and constitutional law in recent weeks He is not entirely pleased Mr Meese has given two speeches criticizing Federal courts and has authorized subordinates to urge the Supreme Court to abandon its 1973 decision legalizing abortion And he appears to be flirting with a bolder assault on some pillars of modern legal doctrine than any attempted by his predecessor William French Smith But it remains unclear how far Mr Meese plans to push for dismantling precedents of which he disapproves because he has backed away from the seeming implications of some of his more farreaching statements For example in recent written remarks Mr Meese seemed to question the constitutional underpinnings of six decades of precedents requiring the states to follow the Bill of Rights Later he disclaimed any intention to challenge these precedents Mr Smith for his part denounced subjective judicial policymaking and suggested the time had come for judges to heed the groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election But as a quintessentially establishment lawyer he was also mindful that it had become almost taboo in recent decades to blast away at the Supreme Court in ordinary political discourse Thus while Supreme Court precedents in Mr Smiths tenure were fundamentally at odds with the Reagan Administration on issues including abortion school prayer and busing he rarely criticized the Courts members or decisions directly By contrast conservative legal experts have heralded Mr Meese as a man who will not mince words when the Supreme Court has gone astray and who will litigate more vigorously in support of Administration policies Terry Eastland the Justice Department spokesman says no other Attorney General in 40 years has been as candid in his comments about the judiciary as has Mr Meese In speeches to the American Bar Association in Washington and in London last month Mr Meese said the Supreme Court had departed from the intentions of the Constitutions framers in recent decisions rejecting Administration positions on school prayer and other issues He also authorized the filing of a brief urging the Supreme Court to overrule its arbitrary 1973 decision legalizing abortion Mr Smith passed up a chance to do the same in 1983 But Mr Meeses most intriguing even radical statement so far was one that he refrained from saying aloud His criticism of the doctrine of incorporation Despite its name that doctrine has nothing to do with business organizations It is rather the intellectual cornerstone of an edifice of decisions in which the Court has held most provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to state governments The first 10 amendments to the Constitution which make up the Bill of Rights originally applied only to the Federal Government But the Court has ruled over the past 60 years that most provisions were incorporated and thus made applicable to the states by adoption after the Civil War of the 14th Amendment which bars states from violating due process of law among other things Of Civil Liberties Litigation These decisions set the stage for much of contemporary civil liberties litigation Federal courts have struck down state laws and actions deemed contrary to the First Amendment freedoms of speech press and religion and its prohibition of establishment of religion the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable search and seizure the Sixth Amendment rights of criminal defendants to counsel and to trial by jury and other provisions Although the historical soundness of the incorporation doctrine was debated for decades and is still doubted by some scholars the Supreme Court has accepted the decisions based on it as settled law since the late 1960s The written version of Mr Meeses speech however seemed to question the entire line of cases going back to 1925 when the Court first said that states must honor the freedoms of speech and press Since then a good portion of constitutional adjudication has been aimed at extending the scope of the doctrine of incorporation Mr Meeses text said But the most that can be done is to expand the scope nothing can be done to shore up the intellectually shaky foundation upon which the doctrine rests And nowhere else has the principle of Federalism been dealt so politically violent and constitutionally suspect a blow as by the theory of incorporation The implication seemed to be that dozens of Supreme Court precedents were suspect those requiring separation of church and state mandating reapportionent of state legislatures protecting privacy rights and limiting libel suits to name a few In delivering his speech however Mr Meese omitted these criticisms of the incorporation doctrine When asked later whether he thought the Supreme Court had gone too far in applying the Bill of Rights to the states he seemed to back away from the criticisms No he responded I well I think this is something thats been done in 1925 and since and so I dont think I do not have any particular quarrel at this stage of the game with what the Court has done in the intervening 60 years Asked to reconcile Mr Meeses written and spoken statements Mr Eastland said it was the Attorney Generals view that the incorporation doctrine rests on shaky ground But Mr Meese recognized he said that the Court has applied provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states and believed some of them should apply Mr Eastland declined to predict whether the Administration would urge the Court to disincorporate provisions of the Bill of Rights But he said There may well be a case in which we might

TEXANS PICK A CONGRESSMAN TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/03/us/texans-pick-a-congressman-today.html,The campaign for the vacant First District Congressional seat here in the rolling green hills of northeast Texas has been billed as a titanic struggle between the Democrats and the Republicans that will chart the course of political change across Texas and even the rest of South But it is hard to detect that here Campaigning in the runoff election that will be held Saturday the Democrat Jim Chapman has so often called himself a conservative Democrat as opposed to a national Democrat that some people here say they are beginning to think he is a member of some new party And Mr Chapmans opponent Edd Hargett the Republican at times seems as if he would be just as happy if the voters would forget about parties and vote for a onetime star quarterback at Texas AM which he is The First District has never sent a Republican to Congress in fact it returned the same Democrat Wright Patman for nearly 50 years Distancing From Reagan And while both President Reagan and Vice President Bush have appeared in television commercials for Mr Hargett the Republican candidate took pains to make sure no one takes him for the Administrations cats paw In a candidates debate two weeks ago Mr Chapman a former District Attorney for several of the 20 counties in the district assailed Mr Hargett as the handpicked candidate of the national Republican establishment which would expect him to toe the party line In response Mr Hargett said he would not be a rubber stamp to anyone Ill vote for President Reagan when hes right for East Texas he said and Ill vote against him when he is wrong for East Texas Mr Hargett even said he would vote with the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr when Mr ONeill was right for East Texas but quickly added that he would not hold his breath until that happened Charges and Countercharges For his own part Mr Chapman used his opening remarks to make it clear that he did not share any of of the liberal ideas promoted by some prominent national Democrats He said he favored school prayer and a balanced budget for example and had no use for abortion or gun control In a recent radio advertisement Mr Chapman has tried to saddle his opponent with the image of a nice fellow whom the Republicans selected at what he called a secret meeting That done the spot maintains Mr Hargetts backers then sent him to charm school to learn his lines Presto an instant Congressman The Republicans meanwhile came out with a new television advertisement featuring Mr Reagan who carried the district overwhelmingly against Walter F Mondale urging voters to back Mr Hargett They also aired a spot accusing Mr Chapman of frightening old people by suggesting that Mr Hargett would help the Republicans whittle away at Social Security benefits Better than a third of the districts voters are over the age of 65 Mr Chapman has dwelled on the subject of Social Security and he has enlisted the aid of Representative Claude Pepper of Florida to write a letter to elderly residents portraying Mr Chapman as a man who would help us protect Social Security from the Republican onslaught A Republican victory Mr Pepper maintained would be a terrible blow against that effort Jobs Are an Issue The drastic erosion of jobs in the district the third poorest of the 27 in the state has also become an issue Lone Star Steel alone has lost about 3000 jobs over the last decade and Mr Chapman has tried to capitalize on that by suggesting that Mr Hargett is not equipped to do anything about it Mr Chapman has for example made much of a article in a Texarkana newspaper in which Mr Hargett was quoted as saying I dont know what trade policies have to do with bringing jobs to East Texas The race is considered close and Democrats are particularly worried that a dispute over the failure of the state to file a Federal election application as required by the provisions of the Voting Rights Act could lead some voters to believe the election might become invalid and thus stay at home which would probably benefit Mr Hargett The state has pledged to provide the necessary paperwork to the Justice Department and a threejudge panel said Thursday that the election could go on and would not be invalidated at a later date so long as the necessary documents were filed by next Friday
IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/04/books/in-short-nonfiction.html,THE TRANSFORMING PRINCIPLE Discovering That Genes Are Made of DNA By Maclyn McCarty Norton 1495 Maclyn McCarty a professor emeritus at the Rockefeller University and the surviving member of the research team that identified DNA as the genetic material in 1944 here recounts the story of the discovery with clarity and dedication In 1941 Dr McCarty a physicianscientist trained in pediatrics and troubled by the deaths of young patients from infectious diseases turned to the research laboratories of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Studies to study pneumonia His mentor Oswald Avery was intrigued by the finding that harmless forms of the pneumococcus bacterium could be heritably changed to diseasecausing ones by extracts from the deadly bacterial cultures Dr McCarty retells the nowclassic story of the detective work that identified DNA as the elusive component of the extract that caused the heritable change Until then DNA was believed to be an uninteresting substance The teams finding preceded by nearly a decade the now famous derivation of DNAs structure by James Watson and Francis Crick The path to the teams discovery was much longer and more arduous than the one to the double helix and a cautious scientific community was slow in rewarding the teams great achievement In The Transforming Principle Dr McCarty reconstructs the logic that guided his experiments with the same care he applied 40 years ago He provides a fascinating view accessible to laymen of the scientific method operating in its highest form
SPAIN LAW ALLOWING SOME ABORTIONS TAKES EFFECT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/04/world/spain-law-allowing-some-abortions-takes-effect.html,Abortion became legal in Spain today over the bitter objections of many doctors and a statement by the Spanish Roman Catholic Church that anyone who cooperates physically or morally in the operation will be automatically excommunicated The regulations enacting the new law signed July 5 by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez after nearly two years of court battles were published Friday in the official state bulletin and went into effect today The law limits abortions to cases of rape a malformed fetus or danger to the mother but all abortions were illegal before The operation is free of charge in public clinics Authorities said they expected 25000 abortions to be performed in the first year but hostility by the church and leaders of the National Medical Association suggests that many Spanish women will still have difficulties getting the operation Called Morally Unjust The sweeping declaration of excomunication was made by the National Council of Bishops five weeks ago and has been regularly repeated by bishops and priests speaking from the pulpit Decriminalization is a morally unjust and pernicious decision the bishops said The life of the new human being is stripped of its rightful protection and left to the mercy of others Archbishop Antonio Rouco Varela of Santiago created a political stir when he harshly condemnded the law in a sermon before King Juan Carlos and Government officials at a mass July 25 celebrating the patron saint of Spain St James He said abortion violated human rights Spain which is an almost totally Catholic has been greatly liberalized since the death of Franco 10 years ago Most Spaniards now back abortions in at least the laws limited cases according to repeated polls The law does not grant abortion on demand a Health Ministry official said in a radio interview The law protects the rights of the unborn child and will be strictly enforced Medical Association Opposed The ethics commission of the Medical Association however declared recently that it opposed all abortions except in cases of rape for fear the law would lead to abortion on demand A 1983 poll of the associations members showed that nearly half strongly oppose any abortion Seeking to avoid suits by doctors the Governments regulations were loosened just hours before publication to allow doctors to exempt themselves from having to perform the operation in public clinics A doctor however must notify the authorities of his decision a requirement that the governing board of the Medical Association said infringed on doctors rights We are ready not to give any list Dr Ramiro Rivera president of the association was quoted today as saying in Diario 16 a leading daily He said he personally favored an inquiry by the association into any member who accepts the regulations and submits his name Ministry of Health officials said an abortion hot line was being installed to give Spanish women informaton they fear doctors may withhold Exemptions Raise Skepticism Those favoring the right to abortion reacted skeptically to the exemptions for doctors The ministrys regulations lend themselves to a situation in which at no moment does a woman have a guaranteed right to abortion said Consuelo Ruiz Jarabo a leader of the Association for the Defense of Public Health She and others said they would start their own information campaigns A law legalizing some abortions was pushed through by the Socialists in 1983 but the main conservative opposition party Popular Alliance appealed it to the Constitutional Tribunal preventing it from taking effect The tribunal finally ruled in April that the law violated a right to life But the justices took the unusual step of suggesting minor procedural changes to bring the law within constitutional bounds The changes were incorporation into the new law
Animal Instinct and Human Intelligence,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/04/opinion/l-animal-instinct-and-human-intelligence-167810.html,To the Editor Since abortion is a legalized crime permitted in our country today maybe it would be wise to reflect on the efforts of animals to raise their young For example emperor penguins raise theirs in the dead of winter along the shores of the coldest lands in the world Antarctica Winds blow more than 100 miles an hour temperatures of the penguin rookeries fall below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit To protect the eggs from the solid ice the male takes the egg as soon as it is laid he holds it on his feet for the full incubation period of nine weeks Since courtship may have taken four or five weeks the breeding males normally fast for threeandahalf months in the coldest part of winter Standing for two whole months of this time with their eggs balanced on their feet under the most severe weather conditions and without food they lose over half of their body weight We call this instinct In contrast doctors in comfortable offices throughout this country including small Lodi and very large New York terminate life in but a few minutes We call this intelligence RON ARTHUR Lodi Calif July 26 1985
Lawyers Were Heroes In Brown Decision,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/05/opinion/l-lawyers-were-heroes-in-brown-decision-169286.html,To the Editor Your report July 15 on the Justice Departments plan to ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its 1973 abortion decision refers to department officials saying the request would be the first time since 1954 that the Government has asked the justices to reverse themselves on a basic constitutional decision In 1954 they would have it the Government successfully urged the Court to overturn its 1896 ruling on the constitutionality of separate but equal schooling in Plessy v Ferguson The Government is taking more credit than it deserves The 1954 Brown v Board of Education case was brought by private lawyers who had planned it for a generation Before Brown the Government had never tried to overturn Plessy though Congressional power to do so would probably have been recognized True when the Supreme Court took the Brown case the Government submitted a friend of the court brief on the plaintiffs side but that brief asked the Court to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of separate but equal schooling and to find instead that the black schools at issue were illegal because they were not equal If that narrow argument had been accepted segregated schooling could have continued simply by improving the quality of black schools But a unanimous Court proceeded to the broader question writing our nations most important humanrights opinion In 1954 as today private lawyers define and litigate the critical civilrights questions At best the Government leaves them alone At worst as today it seeks to undermine them Only after the courts have settled an issue and made it politically safe will the Government use its many resources for the comparatively routine though important task of enforcement STEPHEN GILLERS Professor of Law New York University New York July 16 1985
DEMOCRATS CHEER RESULTS IN TEXAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/05/us/democrats-cheer-results-in-texas.html,Despite the unusual interest of party leaders outside the district Democrat Jim Chapman insisted throughout the hardfought battle for Texass First District Congressional seat that the contest here in northeast Texas was more regional than national Its just another Congressional race Mr Chapmans campaign manager Bill Brannon insisted before the votes were tallied last night But after unofficial returns showed Mr Chapman had defeated his Republican opponent Edd Hargett Chapman forces were a little more willing to accept the races wider implications Mr Chapman won 52670 votes as against 50737 for Mr Hargett a former Texas A  M football star Mr Hargetts total campaign spending will total well over a million dollars perhaps 15million most of it raised outside the low rolling hills of northeast Texas Democrats Applaud Result The argument that voters generally are aligning with the Republicans is clearly not feasible George Shipley a Chapman campaign strategist said after the votes were tallied The national party too found the results heartening Paul G Kirk Jr chairman of the Democratic National Committee said today in Washington The election results demonstrate two things First the talk about realignment is still only a Republican dream And second Democrats will continue to win when we campaign on moderate mainstream issues that connect with the concerns of the average voters For his own part Mr Chapman maintained that the Republicans had fired a 15million volley and still fell short of victory He also noted that both Vice President Bush and President Reagan had campaigned via television for his opponent Mr Hargett simply said he was disappointed He attributed his defeat to a failure to get out the vote adequately Democratic District Even though Mr Chapman won the race Mr Hargett made an impressive showing in a district where voters have not sent a Republican to Congress since the 1870s when part of what is now the First District was represented by a Republican who served less than a full term Mr Chapman had campaigned hard on the Social Security issue maintaining that Mr Hargett would help in a purported Republican plan to whittle away Social Security benefits The Hargett forces tried to counter that and other charges with lastminute television advertisements showing an elderly woman in a rocking chair shelling peas and accusing Mr Chapman of frightening old people Shame on you Jim Chapman the woman chirps flailing the air with a peapod Trade Policy an Issue Another issue that seemed to strike fire was the erosion of jobs in the district Mr Chapman noted that Lone Star Steel once one of the districts biggest employers had laid off thousands of workers in the last decade He blamed American trade policy that he said allowed foreign manufacturers to sell steel in this country at artificially low prices In response Mr Hargett was quoted as saying he did not know what trade policies have to do with bringing jobs to East Texas He initially said he was misquoted then that the remark was taken out of context Mr Chapman made much of the whole affair Mr Chapman also gleefully exhibited a campaign cap given away by the Hargett forces that bore a label Made in Taiwan The Chapman forces also worked hard to suggest that Mr Hargett himself was a product more of Washington than East Texas Debate on Campaign Funds In midJuly the last complete campaign finance reporting period Mr Hargett had received more than 882000 Less than 15 percent of it came from within the district and 40 percent issued from political action committees Mr Chapman also got a lot of financial support from outside the district but of the 333000 he reported raising by midJuly about 40 percent came from within the district A Chapman radio spot portrayed Mr Hargett as the handpicked candidate of the Republican establishment Although race was billed as a harbinger of the future in rural Southern districts where the Republicans are now pinning their hopes for major resurgence in the House of Representatives neither candidate emphasized his party affiliation In the early stages Mr Hargetts broadcast commercials drew on his image as a football star  one newpaper reporter accused him of attempting a quarterback sneak  and throughout the campaign he stressed his independence Mr Chapman by the same token stressed that he was a conservative Democrat who supported school prayer and a balanced budget and opposed gun control and abortion rights

THE ABORTION CONFLICT; WHAT IT DOES TO ONE DOCTOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/magazine/the-abortion-conflict-what-it-does-to-one-doctor.html,ONE FRIDAY AT NOON AFTER FOUR gray days of rain the leaden clouds over northwestern Oregon drew apart and the sun filled the operating room of Dr Peter Bourss clinic in Forest Grove The winter light came through clerestory windows set in the peak of the cathedral ceiling filtering through the glossy leaves of the palms and ferns in the loft falling gently on Dr Bours his nurse and the pregnant woman lying on the operating table The woman looked older than her 32 years  her broad forehead was pale her cheeks slack her eyelids heavily veined She had three children no spare money and wished no fourth child She had come to Dr Bours for an abortion In other rooms of the clinic on other days women gave birth to children they want to raise and love and babies delivered by Dr Bours returned bringing their earaches and their colds for treatment But Tuesday and Friday mornings were set aside for abortions and on those days out of sight of the doctor and his staff but never far from mind a small grim band of men and women guarded the entrance of the clinics driveway Armed with signs and literature old Life Magazine pictures of healthy fetuses and sad pictures of aborted ones they stood outside in the damp cold of that Friday morning Some knelt on the chill gritty pavement heads bowed rosary beads threading through their fingers Others shouted at patients making their way in and out of the clinic Do you know that little babies are dying in there Rosemary Young called to a young woman with a little girl I dont want to hear it the woman shot back April Dauenhauer another protestor raised her eyes imploringly If somebody was murdering me on the sidewalk right now would you ignore it You bet because you asked for it the woman snapped and the clinic door closed behind her The protests started more than two years ago Since then on those days when Dr Bours performs abortions a loose coalition of Roman Catholics and evangelical Christians has set up a gauntlet at the driveway entrance On Mothers Day weekend 1984 two primitive firebombs ignited against a wall of the clinic Several death threats have been made against the doctor and his family his staff and even some of the young mothers whose babies he has delivered None of that has dissuaded Dr Bours from doing abortions but the violence and the protests at his office did reduce the number of expectant mothers who came to him for care Now caught in the same insurance squeeze that has led other doctors to leave the field of obstetrics he has decided to stop delivering babies devoting himself almost entirely to family planning including the practice of abortion Inside the clinic on this Friday noon the woman who wanted no more children had been prepared for an abortion and for a tubal ligation When all was ready Dr Bours  a bearded 41yearold with sandy hair and intense blue eyes  began the procedure Ten or 11 weeks before a sperm loosed inside the woman had joined with an egg in that space medical science knows as the uterus but which antiabortionists call the womb Out of that union came what medicine terms an embryo  to antiabortionists it is a baby Now Dr Bours reversed the process suctioning the tiny form into a clear glass jar It took only a few minutes this procedure sanctioned by law and repeated hundreds of thousands of times each year across the nation For Dr Bours it is part of a modern family practice to those men and women outside the clinic it is murder And the conflict at the driveway has spread through the small college and farming town booming out on the evening news turning the letters page of the local newspaper into a polemical battleground inspiring opposing petitions circulated among the towns 11500 residents In one form or another the confrontation over abortion has found its echoes in dozens of communities across the nation There have been some 30 cases of bombing firebombing and arson at clinics during the last three years In Alabama a Roman Catholic priest smashed up a clinic with a sledgehammer The operator of an Illinois clinic and his wife were kidnapped Patients at a clinic in the state of Washington had their phones tied up by as many as 700 anonymous callers In Texas an arsonists work at a clinic spread to and burned down a small shopping center Pickets march outside scores of doctors offices and clinics and more and more doctors report personal threats The public anger and conflict grow Just last month the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion If the Court did that the legality of abortion would again become a matter of state law and in many states at the time of the decision abortion was still a crime Like other standard medical procedures abortion is normally a private matter quietly practiced seldom discussed by the either the women or the doctors involved But now to meet the attacks of the antiabortionists women are being urged to speak out  Eleanor Smeal the newly elected president of the National Organization for Women has vowed that defending a womans right to abortion will be a top priority for her And Peter Bours who once felt reluctant to enter the public debate has changed his mind I think we have to he says Being lowkey hasnt helped THE COURSE OF PETER BOURSS life in many ways seems to have led him inexorably into the center of the storm over this most divisive of social issues He grew up in the graceful countryside populated by executives and family members of the Du Pont Company outside Wilmington Del Peters father William Alsop Bours III joined the company after graduating from Princeton and Columbia and eventually became a vice president His son was christened William Alsop Bours IV but the family called him Pete and as an adult he chose to be known as Peter It was a milieu of handsome homes and pools and tennis courts of affection for Wyeth paintings Oldsmobiles and the Republican Party Like many of his neighbors Peter Bours went to private schools and then to college At Stanford University he made Phi Beta Kappa his junior year That year was 1965 which also marked a political turning point for Peter Bours I remember William Sloan Coffin coming out and speaking he says recalling the antiwar chaplain of Yale University now the senior minister at Manhattans Riverside Church And I remember after that a whole generation of students in protest He became fervently opposed to the Vietnam War and critical of the society that supported it An economics major Peter Bours did his senior thesis on population control and economic development in thirdworld countries It was an interest he brought from home where his parents had long been active in Planned Parenthood At the end of his senior year the subject of birth control became suddenly personal I was heading off to Boston  to Harvard University Medical School  and my girlfriend of all four years was heading off to law school at Berkeley That was the first month we had sex and she got pregnant In 1966 most abortions were illegal in the United States It had not always been so In fact through most of history they had been freely practiced In early common law abortion performed before quickening  defined as that point when the fetus begins to move in the uterus at 16 or 18 weeks  was not an indictable offense In the mid19th century as Kristin Luker a professor of sociology at the University of California at San Diego points out a survey showed that between 17 percent and 34 percent of all pregnancies in Michigan ended in abortion It was not until after the Civil War in the sway of the Victorian era and at the urging of the recently formed American Medical Association that the states began passing laws making abortion illegal The only exception was when a physician determined that an abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother In California that spring of 1966 Dr Bours recalls after some clandestine arrangements all these furtive plans made through a doctor across the border in Mexico  we had to meet these guys in the Los Angeles airport I had to give them 700 cash His girlfriend flew off to Guadalajara for the abortion and Peter Bours with no money for his own airfare had to wait for her return But even then the abortion picture was changing Some years before in Arizona Sherri Finkbine had discovered that her sleeping pills contained strong doses of thalidomide Although her life was not at risk her doctor urged her to abort her fetus which he felt certain was deformed Her story as Kristin Luker puts it forced people to define exactly what circumstances in principle constituted legitimate grounds for abortion Then in California came an outbreak of rubella or German measles also a danger to a fetus Many doctors considered it reason for an abortion but the California State Board of Medical Examiners for one did not Seven prominent physicians were charged by the board with performing illegal abortions In 1967 urged on by the American Medical Association the American Bar Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics  Gov Ronald Reagan signed a law that made abortion legal in California when done by a registered physician in an accredited hospital to prevent physical or mental damage to the woman Meanwhile Peter Bours had settled in at Harvard His political activism continued centered on opposition to the war Im sure I was considered part of the leftwing element of the medical school he says He also organized a symposium on abortion But that was all from the political end Dr Bours recalls It wasnt like I ever saw myself being involved in it In 1968 Dr Bours married his girlfriend from Berkeley days who had moved to Boston but the marriage lasted only two years Then he moved back West signing on as an intern at the University of California in San Diego By then more than 99 percent of all California women who applied for abortions were being granted them Abortion on demand had become a reality in California and a number of other states had enacted similar laws Peter Bours had planned to become an orthopedic surgeon but during his internship and residency in San Diego he changed his mind He had married again and fathered a daughter Emma and the experience left him more interested in children in families and family care than in bones When he began to practice it would be in family and maternity care In 1973 the Supreme Court issued its landmark abortion ruling Henceforth no state could make abortion unlawful except in those instances when the fetus was old enough to sustain life outside the uterus Before that age thought to be between 24 and 28 weeks  the decision would rest with the woman and her physician F OREST GROVE some 25 miles west of Portland is one of a string of small communities clustered along Highway 8 as it strikes through woods and farmlands toward the Pacific Coast Founded by Congregationalists in the 1840s washed by a tide of Dutch Roman Catholics who migrated from Wisconsin about a century ago it is a town of churches And increasingly in recent years the new congregations have been evangelical and fundamentalist The signs at each intersection along the highway tell the story pointing the way to the Assembly of God Central Baptist First Life Ministries Hillside Bible Foursquare Church The towns population is layered too with lawyers and architects who commute from Portland students and professors from the towns Pacific University and farmers There is also a community of several hundred people now middleaged who split with traditional society during the radical years of the 1960s and 1970s and settled in Forest Grove to find a simpler life Peter Bours too was drawn by the uncomplicated beauty of the place He bought a piece of farmland and an old frame house outside town in 1974 and went into practice By this time Dr Bours was once again single If I werent such a social traditionalist he says in wry reflection I wouldnt have married so many times And within a few years he did it again marrying his nurse Joan Moss Together they built a family practice based on delivering babies  often in that era to couples who wanted their children born at home or in one of the birthing cabins that Dr Bours fashioned from outbuildings on his property It was an effort to take obstetrical medicine out of cold institutional hospital delivery rooms and return it to the home  and it fit with the ideas he had developed during the war years the search for a redefinition of personal and social relationships Few doctors in the area were offering that kind of care So we had a lot of highly educated 30 to 40yearolds in Portland coming out to have their babies with us Dr Bours says For his wife it was an idyllic time In one year she recalls we did 350 deliveries and that was in just 365 days I remember thinking I have the most wonderful job in the world  In time the couple had their own children a daughter Heidi and a son William Alsop Bours V Peter Bours had his own style He wore loose shirts and comfortable pants and knockaround shoes almost never a coat and tie His patients called him by his first name And he kept his rates low paying himself less than 50000 a year sinking the rest of his income into the new clinic which he built in town next to the community hospital Says the Rev Richard E Osburn pastor of the United Church of Christ whose congregation supports the right to abortion A lot of people considered Peter a strange duck Different When the town police would stop Dr Bours for speeding on the way to a delivery recalls the minister a former chaplain of the police force the doctor would inform them that he would meet them the next morning if they wanted to give him a ticket but that at the moment he was in a rush I know that a lot of the officers think of Peter as thinking hes above things the minister says Dr Bourss practice flourished His new office and patient rooms were bright and cheerful crammed with snapshots of pink new babies and their beaming parents And at the top of the building he hung a bell to ring out the news of birth From time to time women would come to him seeking an abortion He decided that women who wished to terminate their pregnancies deserved the same guiltfree atmosphere of professional care that women who brought their pregnancies to term enjoyed Then he recalls the Portland Womens Clinic started referring me a regular group of patients each week Suddenly I had an abortion practice With its low fees and cheerful atmosphere it became one of the largest in the state Reflecting Dr Bourss philosophy the clinic offered women the options of birth control giving birth putting the baby up for adoption or as a last resort abortion One day he stood quietly at the counter in his outer office with a young father and his son whom Dr Bours had delivered six years before Just now he had performed the third abortion for the boys mother Dr Bours turned to the father and said I think we need to get you on some kind of effective birth control A doctor who performs abortions confronts a host of personal decisions The law for example permits abortion until the fetus is about six months of age leaving doctors to decide how late in lifes evolution they are willing to terminate a pregnancy I dont know where you can draw the line Dr Bours said at his home one night as he moved about the kitchen building a casserole I say 12 weeks Others might say 14 16 or 18 weeks When you get beyond 18 or 20 weeks you get into trouble I have a practicable kind of morality The technique changes a lot between 12 and 13 weeks The complications increase The amount of pain to the patient goes up And an abortion on an advanced fetus which has taken on more of a recognizable human form takes a greater emotional toll on a doctor and his staff Earlier that day performing the procedure on the woman who wished no fourth child Dr Bours finished vacuuming her uterus funneling the remains of the fetus into a sock of white gauze suspended in a jar After an abortion the doctor must inspect these remains to make sure that all the fetal parts and the placenta have been removed Any tissue left inside the uterus can start an infection Dr Bours squeezed the contents of the sock into a shallow dish and poked about with a finger You can see a teenytiny hand he said At the sink and sterilizer where the surgical instruments are cleaned a nurse stood and turned on the faucet Ive been cleaning up after him for four years she said We all wish it were formless but its not It has a form And its painful Theres a lot of emotional pain W HEN DR BOURS began performing substantial numbers of abortions in 1977 there were no organized protests Most of the women who came to him for deliveries were unaware that he did abortions But even back then there were passionate antiabortionists in Forest Grove They only lacked a target Then in May 1983 the parish priest at Rosemary Youngs church invited one of the founders of Catholics United for Life to speak to his congregation As the visitor talked of the need to save lives by counseling women against abortion the words tugged hard at Mrs Young At the University of Oregon at Eugene a decade earlier Mrs Young and her thenboyfriend Randy Young a Southern Baptist had  like Peter Bours  been part of the student reaction against the Vietnam War involved in what was then known as the counterculture They helped collect food to supply the Indian radicals rebelling on the reservation at Wounded Knee and for a time considered going to live with friends in a commune In their junior year they married and five months later the 20yearold student was pregnant I considered abortion myself she confesses  she had been raised in the Catholic Church which holds that human life begins at the moment of conception but her faith had slipped I thought seriously about it But I knew that I couldnt do that So she bore her child dedicating herself to house and family while her husband went to work Then Mr Young decided to take instruction in Catholicism Mrs Young went along We had a really nice old Irish priest who answered all our questions she recalls So often you find that so many churches give no absolutes They gave us absolutes Thats what we wanted We were sick of searching and they gave us absolutes Thus when in May 1983 the priest suggested that the women of the parish might want to meet with the speaker from Catholics United for Life to discuss what was called sidewalk counseling Mrs Young offered her home as a meeting place Among those who attended were Jamie Nibbler and Maria Vandecoevering Before I knew it Mrs Young recalls Jamie and Maria said Well go and do it  and theres a doctor right here in Forest Grove  So the picketing outside Peter Bourss office began pitting the doctor who had hewed to the liberal ideas of his college years against many of his neighbors who had abandoned those same ideas The protests have had strong support from the Roman Catholic Church Twice on the anniversary date of the Supreme Court decision the Most Rev Kenneth D Steiner Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon has arrived on the scene to bless the effort And gradually Protestant fundamentalists joined in the picketing Both groups are fiercely singleminded One day Peter Bours recalls they had a 20week fetus in a bottle There were some firstgraders walking down the street and they showed it to the firstgraders and said This is a baby and the doctor in there is killing them for 1000 a baby  In fact Dr Bourss fee is 140 The most vociferous of the demonstrators has been Michael Thomas Story who began conducting his own campaign on the days when abortions were not performed He carried a sign likening the clinic to Auschwitz He paraded with a cross on which he had crucified a doll splattered with bloodred paint Because of Mr Story Dr Bourss children no longer drop by the clinic after school You wouldnt either Dr Bours says if you had Michael Story yelling at you Would you want to be a child brought to the doctors office for an earache and have this man yelling at you that the doctor is a murderer He stopped his disgust evident Ive had a hard time not getting into a fist fight with the guy he said And I havent been in a fight since I was seven years old In fact late last month the two did get into a scuffle The battle over abortion in Forest Grove has taken a variety of forms At one point the antiabortionists started to flood the local weekly The NewsTimes with letters to the editor attacking Dr Bours and his clinic Some of his friends got up a petition of support It drew several hundred signatures Then the fundamentalist owner of a fastfood store started an opposing petition It gathered even more names The attacks on Dr Bours in the letters columns grew ever more graphic and angry Finally says David H Baker the managing editor at the time this elderly lady called me and said Look I love your paper and Ive read it for years and years but I just cant take this anymore And she was crying and sobbing And I said Oh God youre right  When in May 1984 the clinic was bombed Mr Baker fearing that the letters had become inflammatory announced a temporary moratorium on them The first firebomb attempt came the Friday of Mothers Day weekend the second that Saturday In each case a plastic 7Up bottle filled with gasoline was connected to a propane tank and attached to the clinics outer wall Each time the gasoline flamed but the propane failed to explode the cedar wall was badly scorched The bombings were somewhat upsetting says Dr Bourss wife Joan Moss but it was the death threats that changed my feeling and how we lived The first letter handwritten on plain paper and then machinecopied was signed The Firebomber and the writer provided exact details of the firebombs construction In case you havent noticed the letter read there is an evergrowing militaristic movement against babykillers You will be stopped Unless you stop voluntarily upon receipt of this letter you and your staff will be killed to save the lives of those you would kill Terrorism No more than the American revolution was terrorism or the civil war Emma Dr Bourss daughter by his second marriage had just arrived to spend the summer but her alarmed mother insisted that Emma could not stay in Forest Grove So the Bourses rented a house 50 miles away on the Oregon coast and Joan Moss took Emma and her own two children to stay there It was very stressful she says I was very upset Then the second letter from The Firebomber arrived This time Dr Bours did not tell his wife the details The letter  describing the story of David and Goliath  promised that since Dr Bours had not ceased doing abortions he would be decapitated and his head would be left in a public place to be urinated on by his enemies Peter Bours was with his family in their refuge on the coast celebrating his 40th birthday when the next threat came delivered in person to the Bourses house in town As the neighbors described it Someone pulled up in a pickup truck in front of the house at 4 or 5 in the morning Dr Bours said and revved up a chain saw and said they were going to kill the whole family Forest Groves police force of 17 has been unable to find the person or persons who placed the firebombs sent the letters or showed up with a chain saw Gary Tyler the police chief says that his investigation has been hampered because the antiabortionists will not cooperate they take offense at being questioned he says Joan Mosss fear for her children lasted until the end of summer when the family moved back to town And then after two weeks I had my cancer diagnosed she says It was breast cancer the same disease that had killed Dr Bourss sister Mary Anne in 1980 The familys focus shifted to the new threat Joan Moss had a mastectomy and began chemotherapy treatments She lost her hair and bought a wig she rested at home on the days the chemicals made her ill but continued working in the clinic when she felt well As the months passed each Tuesday and Friday brought the antiabortionists back to the clinic but the family was preoccupied by the more immediate threat The crisis that they are all dealing with that they know about Joan Moss says simply is my cancer January of this year brought another anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Peter Bours closed the clinic for the day but at home that night on the television news he saw Bishop Steiner blessing the protest effort And he saw John David Ott a new doctor in town the product of Catholic schools a former Marine who for a time prepared for the priesthood standing over a tiny makeshift coffin with a bugle blowing Taps Says Peter Bours It was gross He called Dr Ott a man he saw every day at the community hospital or the community pool where both men swim at noon They talked and now Dr Ott though still a firm antiabortionist seems sorry about his performance Of Peter Bours Dr Ott remarks I think hes been the fall guy I think theres been a witch hunt and most of the people here are tired of that If anything Dr Bours says the people he sees each day seem to know that were going through a hard time and most of them seem to go out of their way to be friendly In restaurants and stores around town friends remain friends and abortion Dr Bours says seems an issue that most people would rather not bring up  which is fine with us because we talk about it plenty anyway He is glad that he followed his familys pattern placing his children in private schools In public schools he says they might be thrown in with the children of the antiabortionists who really do teach their kids that Im a murderer He has seen the change this message can bring Theres a 6yearold boy that I delivered that I say hello to Dr Bours says and after the last newspaper article came out he wouldnt look at me Thats the hardest thing for me because Ive always prided myself on my relationship with kids It hurts me Dr Bourss practice has been affected Not his abortion practice he says That doesnt seem to have been affected at all But deliveries fell from about 300 cases a year to 150 or fewer The major dropoff he is convinced was because of the protest and the controversy About half are people who are against abortions and didnt realize I was doing them all that time And the others simply worried that someone was going to try to blow the place up while they were in there Meanwhile the controversy goes on The protestors picket The newspaper again prints letters of protest And the threat of violence remains The Rev Stan Doland until recently the pastor of the Foursquare Church and now a missionary said The Marines thats what I call them I dont think the Marines around here will let up until he goes out of business or quits doing abortions or God forbid  something violent happens The church is against abortion but the minister  whose son was delivered by Peter Bours before the pastor knew the doctor performed abortions  cannot bring himself to call it murder Peter honestly believes what he is doing is right the minister says O NE AFTERNOON Rosemary Young spread across her kitchen table snapshots of a handful of women who had been persuaded not to have abortions She pointed to a photograph of Kimberly Crutsinger 19 years of age She comes over quite frequently Mrs Young said Shell probably need our help for quite some time Then Kim Crutsinger arrived carrying her baby Amber Christina She has a 3yearold son as well Her husband who was furious that she chose to have Amber left returned left again He had no job Neither did she and she was pregnant again Everything seems so dark now but I dont regret having them at all Its a responsibility she said her eyes shining but its a joy too She is living on welfare in an apartment of her own For the two children I get 386 a month plus food stamps And I have car insurance to pay It wasnt enough She smiled uncertainly and turned to give Mrs Young some news They are coming to get the furniture today Mrs Crutsingers fortunes have since changed again  her husband is back the new baby has arrived and the furniture is safe But it is the kind of case history she represents that supports Peter Bours in his conviction that abortion serves a moral need He sees women every day he says for whom unwanted pregnancies are a real disaster So for me the continuing experience of being involved in this area further reinforces my feeling that this is right For a time under the pressures of his dayandnight practice and the protests and the worry about his wifes cancer he considered going into industrial medicine or some other kind of private employment or simply moving his practice to a highrise building in downtown Portland But this is home We couldnt replace the friends we have here he says He could however change his practice and he did After 2200 births he decided to stop delivering babies Since April 1 he has accepted no more pregnant women for obstetrical care Dr Bours will confine himself to the other elements of family practice specializing in womens health care family planning birth control and the main business we have been doing abortions and tubal ligations and vasectomies The reason for the change is grounded in a national trend  the huge increase in malpractice suits and as a result an enormous rise in the cost of malpractice insurance For a doctor doing the work of an OBGYN in Oregon in the last three years Dr Bours says malpractice premiums have gone from 6000 to 30000 this year And its expected to continue to go up In fact for many doctors particularly those who do large numbers of procedures as Dr Bours does and for those who deliver babies  it has become more and more difficult to obtain malpractice insurance at all In the first week of July Dr Bours went to court to defend himself against a threeyearold lawsuit brought by the parents of a child whose scalp had been scarred in a difficult delivery The estimated cost of repairing the scar was 4000 Dr Bours says but the parents had sued him for 450000 The jury found him blameless but the case made it more difficult for him to get malpractice insurance To deal with the problem Dr Bours established a new maternity care practice in his clinic under the direction of a nursemidwife who could more easily obtain malpractice insurance But now midwives are experiencing the same insurance problems The new maternity center has received a 60day cancellation notice from its insurance carrier and if a new form of coverage cannot be found Dr Bours said last month then well be out of that business altogether On July 6 Dr Bours turned 41 At about midnight he says as they were celebrating at home I got called off and had to go deliver a baby Now he has only a few more expectant mothers left in his care But the prospect that he will deliver no more babies beneath the bell he erected years ago to ring out the news of birth does not dismay him as it would have once I have a certain sense of relief at this point Peter Bours says We need time to focus on the family
THE OUTSPOKEN TRAPPIST,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/books/the-outspoken-trappist.html,THE HIDDEN GROUND OF LOVE The Letters of Thomas Merton on Religious Experience and Social Concerns Edited by William H Shannon 669 pp New York Farrar Straus  Giroux 2795 MY life is in many ways simple but it is also a mystery which I do not attempt to really understand as though I were led by the hand in a night where I see nothing but can fully depend on the Love and Protection of Him Who guides me These words of Thomas Merton written in 1962 to Abdul Aziz a Pakistani expert in mysticism offer a clue to the extraordinary career of the famous Trappist He was a mystery to himself and he has not ceased to have something of a mysterious character and attraction for countless others who write and read about him nearly 20 years after his sudden death in Bangkok in 1968 In fact the Merton vogue shows no sign of fading away on the contrary it appears to deepen and expand with every year There is nothing more revealing of a persons character than letters written with openness and an honest effort to convey ones reactions to life contemporary institutions superiors associates and those with whom one feels a close bond by way of common interests If Sigmund Freud could be described as aghast at the publication of his letters to Wilhelm Fliess no such reaction would seem to have entered Mertons mind with the single reservation that he requested several correspondents to keep what he wrote confidential lest his views embarrass his religious community or get him into trouble with his monastic superiors Msgr William H Shannon has edited this first volume of a projected series in the same spirit his subtitle The Letters of Thomas Merton on Religious Experience and Social Concerns gives the key to its contents The editors task was not an easy one As he explains there are about 3500 letters to well over 1000 correspondents in the Merton collection at Bellarmine College in Louisville Ky letters Merton was at pains to preserve  which as Monsignor Shannon remarks suggests that he had a premonition of their importance The title of this volume incidentally was taken from the monks letter to a group of students at Smith College who had celebrated a Merton evening He counseled them to learn to listen and to cultivate the silence in which we can find    the happiness of being at one with everything in that hidden ground of Love for which there can be no explanations As for Mertons style it was racy at times fragmentary never dull on occasion it touched on literary grace This was especially true with matters of deep spiritual concern for example as in his two dozen letters to the Brazilian nun Sister M Emmanuel de Souza e Silva several constitute an extended treatise on prayer It was nuclear warfare however that occasioned Mertons most impassioned expression a subject that easily occupies front rank here as can be seen in his more than 70 letters to Wilbur H Ferry a vice president of the Center for Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara Calif On war and peace Merton let go as he said more than once with a verve that revealed how intensely he felt at times he wrote in an ironic vein that might well have made certain hawks wince if they had read his indictment of their policies The cold war and nuclear war were in fact the subjects of several letters he wrote to me in l96162 which I was surprised to find here I had met him only once briefly during a visit to another monk in his abbey The Merton style was not lacking in humor His love for Pope John XXIII was obvious and at the opening of Vatican II he told Rabbi Zalman Schachter that what he had read of the event sounded most hopeful He then added The Pope that wonderful little guy got all the diplomats in the Sistine Chapel and pointed to the Last Judgment of Michelangelo and said Well fellows whats it going to be This struck me as what a Pope ought to be saying When Pope Johns encyclical Pacem in Terris came out in 1963 Merton was elated and remarked to James Forest an activist in the Roman Catholic peace movement The Pope is lucky he does not have to be approved by the censors of our Order he would never get by them The range of interests of this contemplative monk was simply astounding Zen Buddhism Sufism and Shakerism constituted only a sampling of the interests that put Merton in contact with experts both in this country and on the other side of the world He felt a strong attraction to Latin America and in 1967 hoped to be sent to Chile by his order More than once he mentions Ernesto Cardenal the present Minister of Culture in Nicaragua who had been a novice at Gethsemani Abbey during the time Merton was novice master His 22 letters to Dorothy Day the leader of the Catholic Worker reveal his lively interest in racial justice and social reform while those to Popes John XXIII and Paul VI are evidence of his alertness to developments within the church That Mertons fame and influence had become worldwide was obvious when he received a request from Paul VI to write a message from contemplatives to the world and when Boris Pasternak sent him a greeting through a mutual friend T HROUGHOUT this correspondence there is steady and mounting criticism of the American and world scenes with dark foreboding about humankinds future More than once Merton confessed his inability to judge current events because of his seclusion and he shied away from expressing his views on such topics as birth control sterilization abortion and ecumenism When he did occasionally venture a judgment on world politics he could be quite wrong thinking for example in 1962 that Castro is now apparently on the skids Thomas Merton was an extraordinarily complex personality His letters at times showed a sharply critical attitude toward his religious order and his superiors whose censorship of his writings often brought keen disappointment and irritation Yet he retained to the end a basic obedience to their directives and repeatedly counseled his correspondents to accept reverses and remain obedient As he told Dorothy Day in December 1965 I have had enough in twentyfour years of monastic life to know that even if certain measures of Superiors may be a little unfair one never loses anything by obeying quite the contrary and God sometimes reserves special gifts and an extra fruitfulness for us something we could not have gained without this sacrifice Here then is an expertly edited work of absorbing interest in which the reader meets directly one of the most original and challenging American minds of the mid20th century
POPE URGES AFRICAN LEADER TO UPHOLD RIGHTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/world/pope-urges-african-leader-to-uphold-rights.html,Pope John Paul II today offered three African Presidents what a Vatican official called an implicit pact promising Roman Catholic support in return for a respect for freedom social justice and human life The Pope delivered his message as he hopscotched across West and Central Africa traveling some 1500 miles from Togo to the Ivory Coast and then to this capital city of 350000 people surrounded by rich green jungle and tropical forests In an address to priests and nuns here this evening the Pope warned the people of developing nations to be wary of the values of more technologically advanced societies where the religious sense weakens He also urged the priests and nuns to guard against a return to paganism It was one of the Popes most pointed comments on traditional African faith since his trip began on Thursday The Pope commented repeatedly on human rights and justice throughout a grueling day of travel In Togo where he ended a twoday visit that included a visit with President Gnassingbe Eyadema the Pope praised the countrys commitment to religious liberty He said that your Catholic community will bring with it a richness in concert with the universal church and contribute to the progress of the nation Later on arriving in the Ivory Coast he said I believe that most share my conviction that the future will not be happy or worthy of man unless the essential values of justice freedom for persons and groups and a respect for life inspire all of societys activity When he reached Cameroon toward sunset he told a large welcoming crowd including President Paul Biya of his admiration for Cameroons tenacious will to develop its potential in a climate that harmonizes respect for groups social justice and national unity Popes Intent Is Described Joaquin Navarro Valls the chief Vatican spokesman said the addresses were a signal to the leaders of the three countries all of which have substantial Catholic minorities In all these speeches the Pope is offering the President an implicit pact Mr Navarro said He is saying that if they can guarantee three things  social liberty for individuals and groups justice and a respect for life  Catholics would collaborate in building up their countries Mr Navarro said that although the Pope often used the term respect for life to refer to his opposition to abortion he was particularly concerned in these speeches with human rights Among the three nations the Pope visited today the Ivory Coast despite a oneparty Government is generally seen as having the best human rights record Togo allows wide religious freedom but little political liberty Cameroon has severe regional ethnic and religious divisions and last year Amnesty International charged that 120 people had been executed there after a coup attempt In the Ivory Coast today President Felix HouphouetBoigny appeared to address the Popes concerns The President said his country was seeking to produce the seeds of peace justice liberty solidarity Mr HouphouetBoigny announced that in honor of the Popes visit the Ivory Coast would release the major part of its prisoners in December on the 25th anniversary of its independence He also said his country had no political prisoners and did not use the death penalty The Ivorians he said wish to make peace their second religion Dedication of Cathedral The main purpose of the Popes fivehour stop in the Ivory Coast was to dedicate a cathedral in Abidjan whose cornerstone he laid five years ago The cathedral in Abidjan one of Africas wealthiest cities is said to have the largest seating capacity of any Catholic church except St Peters Basilica in Rome It is estimated to have cost 10 million to 15 million The Pope called the modern cathedral an eloquent sign of faith and a testimony to the maturity and vitality of the church
DIVIDED YOUNG DEMOCRATS PICK WOMAN AS CHIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/us/divided-young-democrats-pick-woman-as-chief.html,The election this year of the first woman as national president was supposed to be a proud moment for the Young Democrats of America But by the time Marie Prezioso of Charleston WVa was elected today at the Young Democrats national convention here the 52yearold organization appeared to many of delegates to be deeply divided and lacking a sense of direction The hotly contested race had narrowed to a contest between Miss Prezioso the 33yearold current executive vice president and Jeri Winter 32 of Las Vegas the groups liaison officer with the Democratic National Committee Mrs Winter who won 531 votes to Miss Preziosos 767 was a strong favorite with Young Democrats from the West who are challenging the traditional domination of the organization by Southerners Charges of Embezzling The race intensified last spring when members learned that Mrs Winter faced charges in Nevada of embezzling a quartermillion dollars from the air conditioning concern she worked for and was scheduled to stand trial this fall Mrs Winter daughter of a Nevada legislator at first said the charge was a civil complaint and suggested it was drummed up by political opponents But William Belk the 35yearold outgoing president who strongly backed Miss Prezioso said Mrs Winters explanation was incorrect We did some research and found she had nine counts of criminal embezzlement against her said Mr Belk who is the director of finance for his familys department store chain She hasnt been telling the truth Mrs Winter who has pleaded not guilty to the embezzling charges resisted overtures that she end her candidacy and campaigned doggedly for the Young Democrats post This issue has been hung around my neck by a closeknit group of Southerners who dominate the Young Democrats she charged Drift and Stagnation A second area of concern is more deeprooted than who gets to run the Young Democrats an organization for Democrats 35 years old and younger for the next two years Many delegates say the organization shares with the national Democratic Party a problem of drift and stagnation on national issues dwelling on internal matters rather than discussing national policies Is this convention going to address any of these issues Mrs Winters asked in a debate Friday with Miss Prezioso Mr Belk observed The delegates are pretty feisty and combatant about who gets elected here Thats not bad if theyd use the same energy to support national Democratic goals But its a bloodbath among ourselves The Republicans will have a field day with this They think its pretty funny Money troubles another serious problem shared with the national party has cut deeply into the Young Democrats attempts to attract new members Mr Belk said He placed the current membership at about 150000 and estimated that fewer than a tenth worked hard for the party He said President Reagans popularity among young Americans had frustrated efforts to bring new members into the party In the Presidential campaign he said he had to end voter registration drives by Young Democrats on many campuses because a clear majority of those registering indicated they would be voting for Mr Reagan A Change Since the 1970s Most of the current leaders of the Young Democrats became politically active in the 1970s when the organization was galvanized by several national issues the Vietnam War Watergate civil rights the environment and womens issues According to a number of delegates members now seem intent on building political careers and making job contacts or else concentrate on single issues like abortion or education They say the membership tends to be far more middle class than in the party as a whole Few blacks or members of other minority groups were noted among the hundreds of delegates attending the fourday meeting which began Wednesday at the Doral Country Club on the outskirts of Miami Need for Clearer Message Can you imagine Young Democrats in the 60s and 70s holding their convention in a nonunion country club or any country club for that matter asked a Miami delegate who did not want his name published A string of national Democrats came to address the convention including Geraldine A Ferraro the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate last year and Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware But leaders including Miss Prezioso expressed concern that despite the midnight caucusing and the lapel buttons and pamphlets addressing issues the Young Democrats would go back home to a world not at all touched by their debates and quarrels Perhaps our message isnt strong enough for young people said Miss Prezioso who vowed to change that perception as president Everyone perceives that were ignored even by our own party As if to underline that sentiment it was widely noted that Paul Kirk chairman of the Democratic National Committee did not attend the convention because of a scheduling conflict

G.O.P. SEEKS SUN BELT GAIN IN '86 VOTING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/15/us/gop-seeks-sun-belt-gain-in-86-voting.html,The 1986 elections are shaping up as a major test of the Republican Partys longterm strategy for gaining political dominance in key Sun Belt states Next to deciding which party controls the Senate the most significant political result of 1986 could be the outcome of gubernatorial and state legislative races in California Texas and Florida the nations first third and sixthlargest states respectively Texas and Florida in particular are politically changeable states where Republicans have established a solid base in recent elections In the view of political professionals these states along with California will be crucial battlegrounds in the Republican effort to strengthen the partys hand in the next round of Congressional redistricting Democrats Seek New Gains For Democrats next years elections are an opportunity to break the psychological advantage Republicans have had since President Reagans landslide reelection victory Presidential politics will not dominate the political environment next year and political strategists see the 1986 campaign as a more level playing field for testing the ability of Republicans to compete with conservative Democrats for state and local offices especially in the South Recent interviews with officeholders party officials and political professionals in these states found Democrats publicly confident of their chances but taking seriously the Republican challenge at every level of politics They cite these specifics  The emergence of twoparty politics in Florida is reflected by a dramatic increase in Republican voter registration and by the largest slate of candidates for statewide office ever fielded by Republicans  Texas Republicans narrowly lost an important special election in the states First Congressional District recently and are headed toward a potentially divisive gubernatorial primary that is already generating tension between leaders of the state partys old wing and its new converts former Democrats  In California Republicans are using the reconfirmation vote on the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court to personalize the issue of capital punishment and Democrats are concerned that it could be damaging to their prospects in close races District Boundaries Are Key A Republican breakthrough in these states next year would signifcantly advance the partys effort to position itself for the next battle over reapportionment The Republicans consider reapportionment their best hope for gaining a majority in the United States House of Representatives in the 1992 elections After the 1990 Census governors and state legislatures will draw new political boundaries for Congressional districts to reflect the population shifts of the past decade and the rapidly growing states of the Sun Belt are expected to gain 19 more House seats Democrats now control both houses of the legislature in 27 states and the Republicans have a majority in both houses in 11 with the two parties splitting control in the remaining states In governorships Democrats have a 36to14 advantage over Republicans In California a state with loose party traditions Republicans need to pick up only eight seats to gain a majority in the 80member Assembly Jim Dutra an aide to the Assemblys minority leader Pat Nolan said that in 1984 five Republican candidates lost by a total of 20000 votes out of the more than eight million ballots cast in those Assembly races We lost one seat by 250 votes another by 500 another by 2000 he said adding that Republicans hoped to pick up a minimum of three new seats in 1986 Focus on Governors Race The reelection of Gov George Deukmejian who is expected to be opposed by Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles a Democrat is also an important part of the Republican strategy in California Mr Deukmejian has filled two vacancies on the sevenmember State Supreme Court and could get a chance to fill at least two other seats in a second term If the 1990 redistricting plan is challenged by either party the court will have to decide the issue which is one reason Republicans consider Mr Deukmejians judicial appointments to be so important One court seat Republicans hope the Governor will have a chance to fill is held by Chief Justice Rose Bird who was appointed in 1977 by Gov Edmund G Brown Jr Her reversals of lower court decisions especially in 37 death penalty cases have angered conservatives Justice Bird faces a reconfirmation vote next year and several separate conservative groups are waging a heavily financed campaign to defeat her Some people who follow politics believe the Bird issue could adversely affect Democratic office seekers in the state The Bird thing could be decisive in close races said Peter D Kelly a Los Angeles lawyer who is a former state Democratic chairman Recent polls show that more than 80 percent of Californians favor the death penalty and one state polltaker Mervin Field said his findings suggested that the Bird issue is directly coupled with the public feeling on the death penalty Building on National Success Despite their recent gains in voter registration and public support Republicans are uncertain as to how they can translate their success in Presidential elections into state and local victories This is the third opportunity this century we have had to build on a twoterm Republican Presidency and we have to succeed this time said Gov Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania chairman of the Republican Governors Association Mr Thornburgh whose group plans to spend 2 million a record to aid Republican gubernatorial candidates next year said that part two of the Reagan revolution will be played out in state and local governments and that winning more governorships and state legislative seats was the key to longrange Republican goals Gov Lamar Alexander of Tennessee recently invited Governors Thornburgh and John Sununu of New Hampshire to join a small group of House members and party strategists to discuss how the party could extend Mr Reagans popularity and message to state and local elections Were looking at the polling data that governed the White House political strategy and breaking out those things that can help us at the state and local level Mr Thornburgh said in a recent interview The question is how do we organically transfer the sentiments behind Reagans popularity to the Republican message at the state and local level We dont know the answer at this point Issues Chosen Carefully It may be he added that state and local Republican candidates should as much as possible leave emotional social issues including abortion to national politicians and focus on such concerns as education fiscal responsibility and environmental questions The problem with this as many Republicans acknowledge is that the partys conservative wing feels strongly about social issues But some political strategists including Edward J Rollins the White House political director contend that the party if it is to solidify its gains will have broaden its agenda to reflect the concerns of former Democrats young people bluecollar workers and other newcomers to its ranks Gov Bob Graham of Florida a Democrat said he believes his party will have the advantage on the kind of issues described by Mr Thornburgh On education care for our elderly the environment Florida Democrats have generally been more supportive of these things than the Republicans said Mr Graham who next year is expected to challenge Senator Paula Hawkins a Republican Florida has elected only one Republican governor in this century Claude R Kirk Jr elected in 1966 and no Republican has ever won a Cabinet office But next year Republican candidates will be in serious competition for the governorship and most other statewide offices Four candidates including Mayor Bob Martinez of Tampa have announced their candidacies for the Republican gubernatorial nomination A former local official of the National Education Association Mr Martinez was a Democrat who switched parties in 1983 The Mayors chief political operative is Mac Stipanovich who ran President Reagans campaign in Florida last year They are using the personal contacts and computerized voter files left over from that effort as the foundation of the Martinez campaign Democrats Dominate State Republicans have a way to go before breaking Democratic dominance in Florida They have a majority of registered voters in only 8 of the states 67 counties but they are registering new voters at twice the rate of Democrats Just three years ago registered Democrats in the state outnumbered Republicans 2 to 1 But a continuing Republican registration drive is expected to reduce that ratio to 3 to 2 by the end of this year In the long run this trend in party identification could threaten what has been the foundation of Democratic strength in the South the fact that local politics has traditionally been centered in Democratic primaries Governor Graham said that the experience of several Florida counties shows that when Republican registration reaches 40 percent to 45 percent the scales quickly tip toward a Republican majority When a county reaches that level of registration the governor said people decide its no longer necessary to be a Democrat to have influence in local politics One force swelling Republican registration rolls in Florida is the large influx of people moving into the state at the rate of almost 800 each day New Residents Lean to GOP In terms of population growth said Mr Graham ours is coming almost entirely from new people moving in A preponderance of them were Republicans before they moved here and they tend to identify with national political figures because they dont know our state leaders In Florida where Republicans have registered 400000 new voters since 1980 Mr Graham and other Democratic candidates are avoiding at least publicly organized labor and other groups identified with Walter F Mondales failed Democratic Presidential candidacy Said an aide to one top state Democratic official Our strategy is to show what the state party is about and to avoid any public identification with the symbols of the national party or the Mondale campaign Its a sad fact of life but thats the price Florida Democrats are going to have to pay for survival John Mills the Speakerdesignate of the Florida House said Some people thought we could ignore the national party in 1984 and the result was we lost some people in the Legislature Democrats hold 77 of 120 House seats and Mr Mills said a shift of 20 seats could change the balance of power in that chamber That would mean Republicans would control the next round of Congressional and legislative reapportionment in the state 1986 is going to be bunker time for Democrats in Florida said Mr Mills If we get through 86 and dont get a strong Presidential candidate in 88 then I think well be on a downslide in Florida One Tallahassee lobbyist who is active in Democratic fundraising said This time Democrats are planning their campaign strategies more around the general election than the party primary I havent seen this before in Florida Texas Race Stirs Hopes In Texas Democrats are making much of the fact that their candidate Jim Chapman won the First District Congressional race in a special election Aug 3 All this talk about realignment is hokum said Gov Mark White a Democrat who is facing a Republican challenge next year People in this state vote for the man not the party Some analysts say that realignment does not mean that Republicans are going to win every election but that they will be competitive in places where they have not been The First Districts voters have never elected a Republican to any office The fact that Edd Hargett a Republican candidate making his first bid for office came within a whisker of winning that House seat is seen by some political professionals as another indication of Republican momentum in the state Mr Chapman received 52670 votes or 509 percent to Mr Hargetts 50737 or 491 percent In 1984 Texas Republicans won a United States Senate seat and picked up five new Congressional seats But even more striking was the partys breakthrough in electing county judges and sheriffs Lance Tarrance a Republican polltaker in Houston said that almost as many voters cast straight Republican votes last year as cast straight Democratic votes Candidates Are Sought One of the biggest problems facing Republicans is finding enough strong candidates to take advantage of political openings We have 20 State House seats that we believe are winnable next year said Royal Masset political director of the Texas Republican Party We just need enough candidates to run in these races Mr Masset said the party was focusing on those legislative districts where surveys and past voting behavior show that a Republican candidate would win at least 55 percent of the vote Republicans now hold 53 of the 150 State House seats and need to pick up 23 to gain a majority Every time we run somebody in an unwinnable race Mr Masset said we set our party back Strategists in both parties say the race for Governor will be the controlling event in Texas politics next year and Democrats are predicting and hoping that an intense Republican gubernatorial primary will leave the opposition bitterly divided Role of ExDemocrats Former Gov William Clements who was defeated for reelection by Governor White in 1982 was the first Republican to officially announce his candidacy His chief opponents for the nomination are expected to be Representative Tom Loeffler a conservative with strong political credentials and former Representative Kent Hance a former Democrat who switched parties earlier this year Mr Clements has not concealed his unhappiness with the role another former Democrat Senator Phil Gramm is playing in state party affairs Mr Gramm was behind the Congressional candidacy of Mr Hargett another Democratic convert and is backing Mr Hance in the gubernatorial contest George Strake of Houston the Republican state chairman said an intense gubernatorial primary would be a healthy thing as long as the candidates do not savage one another Potentially divisive primary fights he added are the price Republicans have to pay for growing up  its kind of like raising your kids through their teenage years
BIRTH CONTROL CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/17/opinion/birth-control-control.html,Imagine an American couple who ask their doctor for advice on controlling the size of their family Then imagine the doctor giving them only one answer periodic abstinence Thats unimaginable even a physician who favored the rhythm method of contraception would at least describe the alternatives But the United States Government is about to impose just such a scenario on poor people overseas The Agency for International Development which proposes to give 20 million over five years to promote natural familyplanning programs will no longer require its grant recipients to supply couples with a wide choice of contraceptive methods AID instituted its new policy under pressure from people who believe that all artificial forms of birth control are morally wrong What is at issue here then is not abortion no AID money goes for abortionrelated activities but a persons right to make a free and informed choice about familyplanning methods M Peter McPherson the director of AID describes the agencys new policy as an advance of family planning over all To which we can only say that he must be using a unique dictionary Only four years ago funding for natural family planning was a modest 800000 so low because the method is recognized as unreliable This year funding shot up to 7 million not because the rhythm method has suddenly become more effective but because people who want to control birth control have more clout Maybe thats what Mr McPherson means by advance The Family of Americas Foundation Inc is the first recipient organization to demand and receive permission to deny information to people it serves Representatives William Lehman and Dante Fascell of Florida and Matthew McHugh of New York have blocked funding for the organization until AIDs previous policy is reinstated Everyone who dislikes treating foreigners as lesser beings should wish them success
CONNECTICUT CITY TO HOLD A VOTE ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/18/nyregion/connecticut-city-to-hold-a-vote-on-abortion.html,Residents of this industrial city in central Connecticut will be asked in a referendum in November whether they support legalized abortion and groups on both sides of the issue are already starting campaigns in an attempt to sway voters Last Monday an antiabortion group Celebrate Life persuaded the Bristol Common Council to place a question on the ballot in the November local election that will ask Should the decision by the Supreme Court regarding abortion be overturned It refers to the United States Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade which legalized abortion 12 years ago A Yes vote by a majority of residents would not change the legal status of abortion in Bristol It would simply have the effect of a public opinion poll said James Kennedy a spokesman for the State Attorney Generals office Bristol with a population of 58480 is the states 11th largest city Most residents are Roman Catholic and there are five antiabortion organizations here If Bristol does this and we win the vote you can be sure thousands of prolife groups will follow suit said the Rev Patrick J Mahoney spokesman for Celebrate Life and pastor of an interdenominational fundamentalist church called New Covenant The ultimate goal he said would be to press Congress to act on the abortion issue possibly by adopting a constitutional amendment Laura Minor of Bristol who is a member of the National Abortion Rights Action League expressed hope that the referendum would not turn into a big issue But she added it may spark people to have referenda on their ballots Mrs Minor is director of the Summit Womens Center in West Hartford which performs abortions and provides family planning assistance counseling and pregnancy tests Spokesmen for groups on both sides said they expected to spend thousands of dollars trying to persuade Bristol residents to vote for their position Public forums rallies billboards and pamphlets are being planned Lets Have the People Decide Mr Mahoney acknowledged that Bristols vote might not be representative of an average American town because of its large Catholic population Lets have a town in Iowa vote then said Mr Mahoney a 31yearold father of two who has lived in Bristol for three years Lets have a progressive town like San Francisco vote Lets have the people decide The Bristol Common Council refused to consider the abortion referendum question until Celebrate Life dropped a lawsuit against the city The suit sought a declaratory ruling on whether proposed antiabortion ordinances could have been placed on the local ballot Last year the city refused to put the proposals on the ballot acting on legal advice that said local governmental bodies could not act on abortion matters because abortion was a state or Federal issue The November election will be the second in which Bristol voters can take a stand on a national issue Last year a majority of voters expressed support for a nuclear freeze in a referendum Mayor John J Leone Jr who is seeking reelection said he would just as soon not have this be a major issue in this community But he added he would much rather see a question like this than abortion clinics being bombed
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: POPE'S RHINO,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/18/world/reporter-s-notebook-pope-s-rhino.html,Samia flew 210 miles just to see Pope John Paul II today Samia is a 6monthold 250pound rhinoceros She was flown specially to the Masai Mara Game Park where the Pope took a safari today to make sure he got a chance to see a rhino an increasingly rare species Those attending to Samia took special care to make sure she would not run away when the head of the Roman Catholic Church approached her The attendents have been wearing white robes to get the rhinoceros used to the idea of a man in white And sure enough according to his spokesman the Pope today got a chance to touch Samia She was not afraid The episode was testimony to the lengths to which black Africa has gone to receive John Paul In city after city his picture hung from light posts and buildings Presidents flew him to their palaces traveled with him almost everywhere he went In many countries notably Togo the machines of the single ruling party went to work to turn out the crowds At Niamtougou in northern Togo several thousand people turned out for an airport welcome Not only that The same several thousand people sat in the hot sun for five hours while the Pope made his rounds in the north just to make sure they were all on hand to cheer the Pope when he left Such behavior might be understandable from ardent Catholics but in this crowd there were a lot more than Catholics Ibrahim Daou a leader of a delegation of Moslems said his group was there to receive the Popes blessing He then explained with a large grin Oh were all with the party This was a reference to the Rally of the Togolese People the party of President Gnassingbe Eyadema Mr Daou said that since many in the crowd had been bused in from far away to welcome the Pope there was no place for a lot of us to go so we just sat here and waited There were many explanations as to why all these leaders went to so much trouble for John Paul Much of it is the sheer prestige of being associated with the Pope Some presidents chose to hang their pictures next to his on podiums and light posts Others like General Eyadema just made sure they were always at his side This can be very embarrassing for the Vatican which does not necessarily want the Pope associated with some political leaders known for corruption or a dictatorial style Vatican officials acknowledge privately that there is no good solution to this problem In some cases the Pope seemed eager to link himself with the government This was particularly true in Cameroon where President Paul Biya is a Roman Catholic Though there is much debate over the quality of Mr Biyas human rights record both Vatican officials and American diplomats say things have improved somewhat under his rule At least you can now talk about politics in a bar without being arrested one Cameroonian said And Mr Biya has surely made life for the Catholic Church much easier So the Pope in his speeches occasionally used code words such as moralization associated with the Biya Government The proGovernment press made much of this And the Pope met with Mr Biya privately for 25 minutes  an unusually long meeting the Vatican spokesman went out of his way to say One thing the Popes 27 foreign trips have made absolutely clear is that there are Polish exiles in almost every country of the world Wherever he goes Poles turn out to meet him sometimes in twos or threes sometimes in groups of a dozen or more In Lome Togo a woman with striking blond hair stood out in the crowd She was Katarzna Glowacka 23 years old a Polish graduate student She was standing with her friend Margaret Malgorzata whose father is a Polish diplomat in Ghana The Polish Government is now allowing its diplomats to go to papal events so the whole Malgorzata family and friends decided to come to Togo For the Pope the most surprising Polish encounter took place in Yaounde Cameroon There he was greeted by a tall black man who spoke with him in impeccable Polish The Pope looked surprised The man said he had met his wife in Poland and brought her over The Pope was even more surprised She was a striking darkhaired darkskinned woman and she spoke perfect Polish too Youre very pretty the Pope is reported to have said but you dont look Polish She was not Polish either but a Cuban who had also studied in Poland And Poles or no Poles the local people usually did their best to make the Pope feel at home When he arrived at the airport in Lubumbashi Zaire John Paul looked quite shocked when a choir of young girls a sea of black faces broke into a noble rendition of the Polish song Sto Lat Sto Lat whose key line is May you live 100 years The Pope broke off from the dignitaries stood with the girls and sang right along with them John Paul has been clear throughout his trip in opposing both polygamy and contraception But until today he never used the word polygamy Today in an address at a mass wedding  the Pope joined together 32 couples  he spoke out as inequivocally on these subjects as he has during his entire journey The Christian notion of marriage he said is radically contradicted by polygamy This in fact directly negates the plan of God he said adding that marriage is a communion of one man and one woman And marital love he said is expressed when the couple willingly accepts children and brings them up in the knowledge and love of God That is why he continued antilife action such as contraception and abortion are wrong and are unworthy of good husbands and wives The Popes position on birth control is unpopular with the Kenyan Government since it is trying to bring down its 4 percent annual population growth rate which is believed to be the worlds highest Opposing birth control is not the Governments idea of helping the country On the other hand polygamy is one of the causes of the high birth rate here So that part of the Popes message may be welcomed by advocates of population control And it was noted here that some tribes had a tradition under which a husband could not have sexual relations with a wife for three years after she gave birth to a child This practice together with an end to polygamy might indeed solve the countrys population problem But it was not at all clear that the two practices could ever work well in tandem

D'AMATO STYLE: PLAIN TALK AND HARD DRIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/19/nyregion/d-amato-style-plain-talk-and-hard-drive.html,The Senator from New York put on his babytalk voice Penny girl Alfonse M DAmato cooed into the phone in his Washington office do me a little favor will ya Penny the secretary to Edward Rollins a White House aide had already explained that her boss could not talk because he was in a meeting and had to rush to a reception But the Republican Senator who wanted to ask Mr Rollins about getting the President to campaign for him in New York never takes no for an answer if he can cajole shout ply or pressure his way into a yes or a maybe Penny sweetness he said you walk into that meeting and give him a little piece of paper that says Senator DAmato no make that Alfonse  Alfonse says he hasnt bothered you in a long long time So can you call him  please please Dont forget your friend Alfonse Tell him Ill only bother him for two minutes No one minute Cant you do that for Alfonse What time is the reception Alfonse DAmato may not have a challenger yet but he has an obsession that is remarkable even in the city of political obsessions that is Washington After spending five years getting ready for the 1986 race by pampering New York constituencies and raising 4 million he is now starting some serious campaigning I want to come back Mr DAmato says Ive worked too hard not to come back The 48yearold junior Senator who likes to refer to himself in the third person as the Fonz the Fonzerello or Alfonzo the son of poor Italian immigrants has a fast tempo and a mercurial temperament He can be engaging or he can go for the jugular as his friend Representative Guy V Molinari the Staten Island Republican puts it It is a style rarely seen in the staid Senate where Mr DAmato has turned out to be one of the most surprising and complicated members of the Republican freshman class pulled into office in 1980 on Ronald Reagans coattails and tagged for their initial political immaturity the Popsicle brigade Polyester vs Pin Stripes In 1980 Alfonse was savaged as a Neanderthal who had no business being in the Senate said John Zagame the director of governmental relations for the Republican National Committee who served as Mr DAmatos top aide for three years Al was the pasta candidate and Jacob Javits was the pate candidate He was polyester and Javits was pin stripes Now he needs to be reelected to disprove all that Mr DAmato a former Hempstead Town Supervisor has tried to escape from the long shadow of the Nassau County Republican political machine But he was back in Hempstead Friday to testify about his role in a practice in which Nassau County employees said they were forced to contribute 1 percent of their salaries to the Republican Party in return for raises and promotions He knows that the Democrats are eagerly watching the Nassau proceedings to see if any of the tar sticks to him He calls his association with the machine an impairment but says he wants to show that someone with his background can succeed Maybe it is something I have to prove to people he said in a moment of introspection that you dont have to be an Ivy Leaguer or come from a certain strata that you can be an Alfonse Marcello DAmato and you can have been the product of a political machine and certainly you made mistakes along the way but that in the final analysis its the kind of job you want to do Like Governor Cuomo he has talked about the humiliation he felt as a young man at not being able to get a job with a major New York law firm attributing this to prejudice against his ItalianAmerican heritage and the secondary standing of his law school Syracuse University Democratic Party leaders regard him as vulnerable but they concede that he is in a stronger position than they ever could have predicted when he narrowly won office after Mr Javits a veteran Republican Senator who ran on the Liberal Party line and the Democratic candidate Elizabeth Holtzman split the liberal vote Miss Holtzman now the Brooklyn District Attorney whom Mr DAmato calls Holtzperson is considering running against him next year as is former Representative Geraldine A Ferraro who was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Vice President in 1984 When asked how he would fare against those two Democrats the Senator merely grinned and said Teeheehee Mr DAmato relishes the appellations some Democrats use to deride him the Pothole Senator and the Alderman Senator He polishes an image that Norman Ornstein a political scientist calls an Everyman fighting for the working Joes and he trumpets his success in bringing home the pork money for housing transit and water projects in a state that has often got the short straw in the draw for Federal dollars He says he is not trying to create a role for himself now as a stylish orator helping to shape foreign and national policy the traditional reputation of senators from New York he says he wants to be the sort of player who runs the ball on the ground and gets a few yards here and there for his state A Medal for the Gershwins On the frenetic evening that Congress passed a budget and adjourned Mr DAmato was lobbying a couple of senators who were balking at a resolution to mint a gold medal commemorating George and Ira Gershwin The Gershwins he explained are New Yorkers When he sidles up to you and says I got something I want to talk to you about buddy you know Als got another one in New York said Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska Senator Stevens the Republican chairman of the subcommittee dealing with post offices recalled being hounded relentlessly by Senator DAmato about the name of a new post office in New York Als a very personal guy and he can rub people hard if he doesnt get what he wants Senator Stevens said Hell bang the table wave a paper at you but when he knows the decision is made he stops and says Hey buddy lets get a cup of coffee  The Smallest Details He personally gets involved in the smallest details from phrases in minor speeches  Say it in American English OK babes he tells a speech writer  to whether the pictures from fundraising events have been mailed out Mr DAmato regards going to the Senate floor as a chore I wouldnt fit in at the Court of St James he said His high scratchy voice and thick New York accent do not seem suited to highflown oratory and phrases such as my distinguished colleagues But in the nittygritty of committee hearings he is a master And on the telephone he is an impresario The phone calls cascade into his office and his car all day long Sometimes he talks to two or three people at once his voice a Beethoven sonata of crashing fortes and silken pianissimos profane or purring depending on what is needed The conversations evoke the DAmato code of deals made and favors traded and loyalties kept or broken I did a little miracle for you  I got you a million he proudly told Walter Haslik the Water Commissioner of Brookhaven on Long Island as he reported his success in securing funds for 500 homes to hook up to a central water supply I keep my commitments Now do that other thing for me Its Sewed Up His conversations reflect his delight in playing Mr FixIt and his interest in making sure the press knows what he has fixed Its sewed up so dont shoot your mouth off Call the guy up tell him the Senator is very antsy and hed better do this or Ill start objecting to everything he wants Tell him this isnt right  its America Tell the bum Ill kill him Zook it up with the press you know the weeklies He always signs off even the most bitter conversations with OK I love ya babes Nice or Rough Although some Senate aides who have tangled with Mr DAmato have been sharply critical of his style his administrative aide Michael Kinsella said he believed the Senators tablethumping made him more effective I tell people Tina Turnerstyle that we can do it nice or we can do it rough Mr Kinsella said And if theyve been through a project with the Senator when he used a whip a chair and a gun they dont want to go through that again Mr DAmatos tenacious style does not always work He wears well with some people he does with me said Representative John J LaFalce a Democrat from upstate New York But I know some he doesnt wear well with Mr DAmato cedes the intellectual plane to New Yorks senior Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a Democrat  He is a a student of history I admire him for it  but he paints himself as the more aggressive member of the team I have no problem being known as the person who fights for New York Mr DAmato said Federal Grant Money Mr DAmato has deftly used his Senate Appropriations Committee seat to win Federal grant money for the state In 1982 he agreed to support a gasoline tax increase in return for a commitment to spend 900 million over four years on New Yorks mass transit This year he got a 12 million Federal grant for buses in Rochester and obtained 5 million for an Albany development project Although Mr DAmato is prodefense he threatened to vote against the MX missile last year until the Reagan Administration agreed to his demand to provide more resources to fight drug smuggling in New York He is a fiscal conservative but he voted for the multibilliondollar Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway which many critics called the classic example of porkbarrel spending in exchange for support for the cleanup of a waste site near Buffalo Wasteful Spending When he was traveling upstate last week holding hearings on legislation he has introduced to take the money seized from drug criminals and use it for enforcement and prevention he said his bill would pinpoint the best programs and stop wasteful spending on a lot of needless programs But only a few days before he had tacked on to his appropriations bill as a favor to his friend Senator Paula Hawkins Republican of Florida an amendment that would allocate 325000 to create a commission of seven senators to monitor and promote compliance with international narcotics control treaties The move enraged Senator Wendell H Ford Democrat of Kentucky one of the few legislators left on the floor at the late evening hour Saying that we already have Federal agencies set up to do that Mr Ford suggested that this was merely a way to give seven senators a travel and publicity boondoggle Mr DAmato has seized on issues that appeal to many New Yorkers even if they have little to do with Congress He captured headlines for defending Bernhard H Goetz who shot four young men who asked him for money on a New York subway and for recommending that funds be cut off for two troubled subway projects in New York He will fight for New York money he said but he will also fight to see that it is not misspent The Senators ability to spin publicrelations gold is perhaps best illustrated by the taxdeductibility issue It was Senator Moynihan who first pointed out in an OpEd column in The New York Times last Nov 21 that the taxsimplification plan proposed by Representative Jack Kemp a New York Republican and Senator Bob Kasten a Wisconsin Republican eliminating all state and local income tax deductibility would be ruinous to a hightax state such as New York Needed to Take the Lead But it was Mr DAmato who quickly recognized it as more than an academic problem He called in an aide to Senator Moynihan and suggested that the two senators immediately sponsor a senseoftheSenate resolution protesting the deductibility proposal He said he needed to take the lead on this because he was up for election the aide recalled and that Senator Moynihan could take the lead on issues in 1988 when hes up Soon Mr DAmato was holding hearings all over the state on the issue and along with Representative Mario Biaggi a New York Democrat was heaving cardboard boxes representing copies of the Reagan tax revision off the deck of a tall ship in a New York Harbor reenactment of the Boston Tea Party Not everyone agrees that Mr DAmatos approach is best Mr Ornstein a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute said When youve got a senator from New York not being one of the major movers and shakers on big issues like the deficit and instead focusing a lot of attention on Bernhard Goetz it changes the whole concept of what New York stands for It seems to be a gamble that has paid off politically he said But it may be shortsighted to focus on the narrower pork projects In the long run what is best for the state is involved with the larger issues of the national and international economy Truman Is His Idol Mr DAmato who says his political idol is Harry Truman has put his loyalty to New York above his fidelity to the President and the conservative cause With New Yorks large Jewish constituency in mind the Senator first broke with President Reagan over the Administrations approval of the sale of sophisticated surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia In April he was one of four Senate Republicans to vote against the Presidents compromise budget He objected because of the plans proposed deep cuts in domestic programs particularly a proposal that sought to trim Social Security benefits An Opportunist This behavior has drawn the ire of some conservative groups that supported Mr DAmato in 1980 Hes an opportunist trying to take a highprofile role in attacking the President with no other priority in mind than getting reelected said Robert C Heckman chairman of the Fund for a Conservative Majority But on social issues Mr DAmato has remained conservative He favors the death penalty and has voted to weaken guncontrol laws He has voted against Federal financing for abortions even in cases of rape and incest and is a supporter of the Human Life Amendment which declares that life begins at conception Issues for Campaign After Congress recessed he dashed around upstate New York where he sketched out issues for the coming campaign He talked about curbing drugs and crime He demanded a redress of the trade deficit but in more blunt terms than other politicians Criticizing the Japanese as he rode by car from one event to another he said When they drop off the cars they bring the boats back empty They should have to fill up those boats with our coal timber and grain He said he had paid the price for his compulsive politicking with the end of his 23year marriage to his wife Penny with whom he has four children The two are separated and Mr DAmato lives in a condominium in northern Virginia Mr Zagame his former aide recalled that after Mr DAmato first announced for the Senate they were flying from New York City to Buffalo The candidate looked out the window at the tiny specks of people below and yelled You dont know it yet but youre going to

POPE APPEALS FOR FAMINE AID AND ORTHODOXY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/19/world/pope-appeals-for-famine-aid-and-orthodoxy.html,Pope John Paul II concluded his visit to black Africa today with a solemn appeal on behalf of the victims of famine renewed criticism of apartheid in South Africa and a firm call on theologians not to stray from Roman Catholic orthodoxy The Popes five addresses today summed up the message he took with him through six countries across black Africa over the last 11 days Several hundred thousand people gathered in Uhuru Park here for a mass this morning closing the 43d Eucharistic Congress The Pope again defended the Catholic concept of marriage the exclusive and unbreakable union of husband and wife Later he used an address at the United Nations Environmental Program to issues a solemn appeal on behalf of the people of the Sahel and of other critical regions where the drought is still continuing and there is a clear need for international assistance and solidarity In reference to political problems that have snagged the delivery of food to the starving the Pope asked nations to solve the conflicts which are hindering efforts to help Using a broad definition of the environment to hammer away at his major themes he said environmental problems should be seen in relation to the needs of actual men and women Whatever impedes human freedom or dishonors it such as the evil of apartheid and all forms of prejudice and discrimination is an affront to mans vocation to shape his own destiny he said Before returning to Rome on Monday night the Pope will fly eight hours to make a stop in Morocco where he will say mass and address a group of Moslem youth in Casablanca Although the Pope toughened his message on theological issues today his tone to black Africans has generally been warm and conciliatory The chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls agreed in response to questions from reporters that this approach stood in sharp contrast with the much firmer line John Paul has taken on other trips notably his visit to the Netherlands in May Hes much more demanding in some places and less demanding in other places Mr Navarro said But he added that despite the difference in tone the Pope remained very strict on questions of church dogma wherever he went As an example the Vatican spokesman noted that two of the 32 couples the Pope married at a mass on Sunday were carrying their children with them This he said was a sign of the Popes openness But it did not stop John Paul from firmly condemning polygamy birth control and abortion in his sermon at the same mass Mr Navarro said A critical issue during the Popes visit has been the extent to which African customs and traditional religious beliefs can be integrated into Roman Catholicism John Paul tread a careful course repeatedly declaring himself sympathetic to forms of Catholicism that were authentically African and authentically Christian He told animist priests that their faith and Catholicism had much in common And he said the day of the European missionary was passing and that spreading the faith was now the job of African Catholics But he also insisted that the church in Africa remain true to orthodoxy and he repeatedly condemned polygamy In a dedication speech at the Catholic Higher Institute of Eastern Africa he said In order to be truly Christian theological reflection must be guided by the revealed word of God and by the teaching of the church But most of the Popes remarks were on the social and human rights themes that have characterized his visit In his environmental address he said that the exploitation of the riches of nature must take into account not only the immediate needs of people but also the needs of future generations In an address to Hindus and Moslems the Pope asked for cooperation across religious lines to help refugees who had fled repressive situations or zones of war or famine

CHRONOLOGY OF ROBIN'S TROUBLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/22/business/chronology-of-robin-s-troubles.html,Following is a chronology of events leading to yesterdays announcement by the A H Robins Company that it has filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code June 1970  A H Robins acquired the right to market the Dalkon Shield from the Dalkon Corporation Robins said that it had tested the device rigorously January 1971  The company began national marketing of the device May 1974  Robins implicated the Dalkon Shield in the deaths of four women who became pregnant while wearing the device and suffered septic abortions caused by infection in the uterus These findings were disclosed in a letter sent by the company to 120000 doctors At the time some 22 million women had been fitted with the shield since 1970 June 1974  Robins suspended distribution and sale of the Dalkon Shield pending a safety study by the Food and Drug Administration January 1975  Robins removed the Dalkon Shield from the market The company termed the action market withdrawal not recall because it was undertaken voluntarily rather than at the order of the FDA July 1979  A Federal court awarded 68 million to a Colorado woman who charged that use of a Dalkon Shield had caused a miscarriage that almost killed her It was the largest claim awarded to date in a case involving the product September 1980  Robins recommended to doctors that they recall all Dalkon Shields June 1982  A Federal appeals court ruled that individual claims filed by women who say they were injured through use of the Dalkon Shield did not have to be integrated into a classaction suit October 1984  Robins started a television advertising campaign aimed at convincing women still wearing the device to have it removed Claims paid by Robins and its insurers at this time amounted to 2447 million in 7600 suits involving the device with 3768 still pending April 1985  Robins set aside a 615 million reserve to settle legal claims from thousands of women who used its Dalkon Shield The reserve was by far the largest provision of its kind to date in the history of product liability cases May 1985  A jury in Wichita Kan awarded nearly 9 million to a woman who charged that the use of the shield forced her to undergo a hysterectomy The award was the largest made to date in the history of litigation involving the shield July 1985  A Federal judge rejected a request by Robins to grant classaction status to the remaining suits resulting from its Dalkon Shield The move in effect upheld the 1982 appeals court decision Aug 21 1985  Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors citing in part the burden of litigation relating to the Dalkon Shield
"ROBINS, IN BANKRUPTCY FILING, CITES DALKON SHIELD CLAIMS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/22/business/robins-in-bankruptcy-filing-cites-dalkon-shield-claims.html,The A H Robins Company besieged by health claims from its Dalkon Shield birth control device filed yesterday for bankruptcy protection from its creditors It became the second major American company to do so because of expanding damages from defective or dangerous products The Richmondbased pharmaceutical company which said it is otherwise financially healthy said the claims and damage awards threatened its viability The company said it became clear that the 615 million fund it established in April would not be enough to pay legal expenses and compensatory and punitive damages to thousands of women whose health problems included pelvic infections sterility and spontaneous abortions A few deaths have also been reported Last fall the company urged women still using the device to have it removed and offered to pay the medical costs It said yesterday that it has so far paid 16 million to 4500 women for that purpose In another case involving product liability Eli Lilly  Company pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that it failed to tell the Government about four deaths and six illnesses related to its arthritis drug Oraflex [Page A16] A H Robins said it hoped the Federal bankruptcy court in Richmond would set up a payment schedule that would enable it to survive while insuring that victims would be treated fairly In a statement the companys chief executive E Claiborne Robins Jr called it essential that we move to protect the companys economic viability against those who would destroy it for the benefit of a few Robins released no estimates of its total liability but some financial sources said it could be as high as 2 billion At the end of 1984 the company listed 309 million in assets About 28 million of the intrauterine birth control devices were sold in the United States from 1971 to 1974 when the product was discontinued the company said Another 17 million were sold abroad it said But few suits have been filed outside the United States a company spokesman Roscoe E Puckett Jr said Robins is filing for what has been called preemptive bankruptcy intended to protect itself from billions of dollars in health claims from its products In 1982 the Manville Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over asbestos claims Both concerns had strong balance sheets at the time of filing but faced potentially devastating claims In a Chapter 11 filing a company asks a judge to postpone the payments of its debts until a manageable repayment schedule can be drawn up The judge can order a company to be liquidated to pay those debts but normally it emerges from bankruptcy and continues to operate Legal experts said the likely result of the bankruptcy action would be to consolidate into one forum the thousands of cases that have been filed around the United States On Aug 2 Manville agreed to set up a 25 billion fund proposed by a courtappointed attorney to settle its claims the only such fund larger than Robins Some legal experts then said that Manvilles bankruptcy filing had been a mistake because the fund was probably larger than the company would have had to pay by fighting each claim separately Some lawyers yesterday repeated that warning in the Robins case Robins said its filing was spurred by the Aug 9 refusal of attorneys representing most of the plaintiffs to agree to a classaction suit on the issue of punitive damages In a class action each victim receives the same award determined from a lump sum payment The damages awarded are usually far less those given in individual personal injury cases It was unclear last night whether Robins will have the same protection as Manville In July 1984 Congress said bankruptcy courts could deal only with existing debt not potential product liability claims George S Deptula a Syracuse attorney and member of a New York State Bar Association unit on business law said the bankruptcy court in theory could continue the bankruptcy until pending claims are settled elsewhere but existing creditors might challenge such an action Called Victory for Clients Attorneys in the personal injury cases yesterday called the filing a victory that would lead to high awards for their clients What happened in the Manville case is exactly what will happen here said Jerome F ONeill of the Burlington Vt law firm of Manchester  ONeill one of the lead plaintiff attorneys in the Robins case Robins will not find itself protecting shareholders as it wants to Instead it will wind up paying as much to women as it would have otherwise He said however that the company could save substantially on its legal costs and could save somewhat on punitive damages As of June 30 Robins and its insurers had paid 3783 million to settle 9230 cases the company said Legal expenses totaled another 1073 million The company said about 5100 cases were still pending and the pace of new claims is increasing Legal sources said the payment in settled claims has averaged about 65000 but has ranged up to 300000 By contrast of 60 trials that have produced verdicts the highest amount paid was 68 million The company has won 27 of those cases Analysts Not Surprised Financial analysts praised the companys financial performance and were not surprised at the bankruptcy filing A H Robins is a very fine company said Craig B Dickson of Interstate Securities in Charlotte NC But in the current jury climate punitive awards are very high For an otherwise healthy woman to get punitive damages before a jury as the result of contraception problems is not very difficult for her lawyer He added that the company would have to provide more money to victims than the company could earn in the next 10 years Mr Robins said the company intended to meet its new and ongoing obligations to suppliers of goods and services while a reorganization plan was being drawn He said pay and benefits for the companys 6000 employees would be unaffected and that no layoffs were planned Todays filing does not mean the company is going out of business or that its assets will be liquidated said Mr Robins whose family founded the business in 1866 In addition to the Dalkon Shield the company is known for its Robitussin cough syrup The company said it markets products in much of the world In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Robins stock dropped 625 cents a share to 10125 In 1983 the stock sold for 29375 Chronology of Robinss Troubles June 1970  A H Robins acquired the right to market the Dalkon Shield from the Dalkon Corporation Robins said it had tested the device rigorously January 1971  The company began national marketing of the device May 1974  Robins implicated the Dalkon Shield in the deaths of four women who became pregnant while wearing the device and suffered septic abortions caused by infection in the uterus These findings were disclosed in a letter sent by the company to 120000 doctors Some 22 million women had been fitted with the shield since 1970 June 1974  Robins suspended distribution and sale of the Dalkon Shield pending a safety study by the Food and Drug Administration January 1975  Robins removed the Dalkon Shield from the market The company termed the action market withdrawal not recall because it was undertaken voluntarily not at the order of the FDA July 1979  A Federal court awarded 68 million to a Colorado woman who charged that use of a Dalkon Shield had caused a miscarriage that almost killed her It was the largest claim awarded to date in a case involving the product September 1980  Robins recommended to doctors that they recall all Dalkon Shields June 1982  A Federal appeals court ruled that individual claims filed by women who say they were injured through use of the Dalkon Shield did not have to be integrated into a classaction suit October 1984  Robins started a television advertising campaign aimed at convincing women still wearing the device to have it removed Claims paid by Robins and its insurers at this time amounted to 2447 million in 7600 suits involving the device with 3768 still pending April 1985  Robins set aside 615 million to settle legal claims from women who used its Dalkon Shield The reserve was by far the largest provision of its kind to date in a product liability case May 1985  A jury in Wichita Kan awarded nearly 9 million to a woman who charged that the use of the shield caused her to undergo a hysterectomy The award was the largest made to date in the history of litigation involving the shield July 1985  A Federal judge rejected a request by Robins to grant classaction status to the remaining suits resulting from its Dalkon Shield The move in effect upheld the 1982 appeals court decision Aug 21 1985  Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors citing in part the burden of litigation relating to the Dalkon Shield
"AS TEXAS REPUBLICAN PARTY GROWS, SO DO RIFTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/23/us/as-texas-republican-party-grows-so-do-rifts.html,For years the Republican Party of Texas had trouble getting anyone to run for office but now it may have more candidates than it wants Rifts are opening in the party as it is taking hold on once Democratic soil Two candidates have already announced they would enter the Republican primary next year to try to unseat Gov Mark White and a third is expected to run Republicans are not sure whether the contest will be good or bad for the party Many Republican leaders expressed dismay recently when William Clements who was the first Republican in 105 years to be Governor announced he wanted the job back from Mr White Mr Clements who is 68 years old lost to Mr White in 1982 and many Republicans say he is not the best candidate He will be opposed in the primary by Representative Tom Loeffler of San Antonio who announced his candidacy today The third Republican candidate is expected to be former Representative Kent Hance Mr Hance is one of a growing number of conservative Texas Democrats turned Republican While Republicans may question the value of the competition to the party in the state they are still delighted with the attention a threeway freeforall would bring Its a Pleasant Change For the first time in history our nomination is worth having said George Strake the state Republican chairman Its given us headlines weve never had before Its a pleasant change if only we can keep from shooting ourselves in the foot I would rather not see Bill Clements run for Governor at this time said Joe Stivers the Republican chairman of Walker County in east Texas home of Democrats who as the saying goes would vote for a Democrat even if he was a yellow dog But this will bring a lot more conservative Democrats over to the Republican primary and that is essential to building a party All this is generally seen as a fundamental realignment of Texas politics More and highly conservative Democrats are identifying with the Republican Party The number of Texans who call themselves Republicans grew by 10 percentage points from December 1983 to January 1985 according to the Texas Poll conducted by the Public Policy Resources Laboratory at Texas AM University The quarterly poll reported that the Republican count rose to 32 percent in 1985 from 22 percent in 1983 while the Democratic tally dropped to 34 percent from 38 percent and independents decreased to 32 percent from 36 percent The most notable party switchers over the last two years are Senator Phil Gramm and his protege Mr Hance Judgeships and other county and local posts are in Republican hands for the first time The Republicans did suffer a setback Aug 3 when a special election to fill a Congressional seat in eastern Texas went to a Democrat Eyeing Attorney Generals Chair Two Republicans State Senator J E Buster Brown of Lake Jackson and Edward Walsh a former District Attorney of Williamson County are running in the primary against Attorney General Jim Mattox who is considered vulnerable Republicans hope to control the State House of Representatives by 1991 They now hold 53 of its 150 seats But the broader the base of the party the more fractious it becomes A growing rift is being noticed between oldline conservatives and younger and perhaps more moderate urban Republicans in Dallas Houston and San Antonio David B Hill of V Lance Tarrance Associates pollsters for Republican candidates says the newer Republicans are either newcomers to the state or young people That creates tension in any Southern party a dichotomy between economic and social issues he said The new people tend to be more liberal on social issues than native Texans but perhaps even more conservative on freemarket issues The candidacy of Mr Clements a Dallas oil entrepreneur is tearing personal loyalties Jim Francis his campaign manager in 1982 is committed to Mr Hance Tobin Armstrong a south Texas rancher who was Mr Clementss chief assistant for appointments is backing Mr Loeffler Karl Rove of Austin who conducted the mail campaign for Mr Clements in 1982 and for Mr Gramms Senate race in 1984 at first committed himself to work for Mr Hance Then he withdrew to back Mr Clements after the Clements announcement July 26 Republican financial backers are uncertain where to put their money On Aug 3 the state Republican executive commitee considered a resolution asking Mr Clements to drop his campaign but then withdrew it Optimism Mixed With Doubts In the long run said Mr Francis a hotly contested primary is a sign of growth and maturation for the party but the overriding issue is who can beat Mr White He says he doubts Mr Clements who would be 70 when he took office can do that Mr Clements is generally considered the frontrunner Although his sometimes abrasive personality and the fact that he frequently does not consult local party leaders have put people off many Republicans say he was a competent Governor Backers of Mr Hance who is 42 years old feel he has the best chance because he appeals to conservative rural Democrats without whom the Republicans cannot win Mr Loeffler 39 a longtime Republican has strong backing from party stalwarts many of whom suspect the sincerity of Mr Hances Republican vows Many Democratic leaders say they are worried about their partys future The Republicans stated aim is to draw populist conservative voters into their primary forcing the Democratic primary to the left This is not a liberal state said George Christian a former aide to President Johnson who is a power in the dominant conservative wing of the Texas party Democratic primaries are becoming more liberal because many are leaving the party It is going to be more difficult for conservative Democrats to win primaries The Younger Voters Most disturbing for Democrats is an increase in Republican Party allegiance among younger white voters said George C Shipley a Democratic polltaker in Austin The politically knowledgeable say the younger voters are less dogmatic and are likely to change the party that many are less interested in such social issues as abortion than in nutsandbolts business matters that they are likely to demand improved schools and other services One such younger Republican State Senator Cyndi Taylor Krier of San Antonio says one of her priorities is improving education to maintain a healthy business climate We will see a broadening of the view of Republicans she says Thats what made the Democrats so strong There are predictions of a big turnout for the Republican primary The largest previous such turnout was 339265 in 1984 Next time many Republicans say it could exceed 500000 Will that be good or bad So long as it does not get too rough and personal it will be good said John R Knaggs a Republican consultant in Austin Many of us want a more balanced twoparty system To do that we must have large primaries

CAMPAIGNS TAKE SHAPE IN ABORTION REFERENDUM IN BRISTOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/25/nyregion/campaigns-take-shape-in-abortion-referendum-in-bristol.html,LAURA MINOR a leader of the abortion rights movement in Bristol would rather there was not going to be a referendum on abortion in Novembers local election but she thinks some good might yet come of it Its time for people to start discussing this issue she said She said a friend of hers went into a bar last week in Bristol a central Connecticut industrial city of 58480 and asked the men sitting near her their feelings on abortion At first there were not too many comments Mrs Minor said but before long there was a riproaring discussion on the whole issue The abortion referendum which is nonbinding is believed to be the first in the nation and it has attracted attention both in and out of Connecticut I think a lot of people are going to watch Bristol to see what happens said Mrs Minor a member of the National Abortion Rights Action League and the director of the Summit Womens Center in West Hartford which provides abortions and other gynecological services and counseling The Rev Patrick J Mahoney spokesman for Celebrate Life a local antiabortion group and the pastor of an interdenominational fundamentalist church in Bristol called New Covenant said We are looking to Bristol as sort of a test case in the United States Local antiabortion groups are hoping to win the vote and influence municipalities across the nation to follow suit They ultimately seek to press Congress to act on the abortion issue possibly by adopting a constitutional amendment Meanwhile some East Hartford residents have indicated interest in having a similar referendum in their town said Frank Plati director of Defenders of the Unborn an antiabortion group The Bristol referendum was proposed by the Celebrate Life group and approved by the Bristol City Council earlier this month It asks voters if they feel Roe v Wade the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion should be reversed The question on the ballot will be Should the decision by the Supreme Court regarding abortion be overturned The wording is a compromise the two sides worked out Both sides in the issue are getting ready to campaign for the November vote with rallies forums billboards and pamphlets Antiabortion people are planning to meet tomorrow night in the Bristol headquarters of the Connecticut Alliance for Life a newly formed coalition of about a halfdozen organizations On Tuesday night Mrs Minor is conducting a meeting of people who want to advance the prochoice position There is talk on both sides of seeking help from outside Bristol Reverend Mahoney said he wanted to ask John Cardinal OConnor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York to come to Connecticut to speak Mr Plati who lives in Simsbury but is getting involved in the Bristol campaign said he wants to invite Joseph Schiedler who wrote the book Closed 99 Ways to Stop Abortion Gayle Brooks of Southington coordinator for the state chapter of the National Organization for Women said her group plans to work with those seeking no votes in the referendum Clergymen in Bristol are split on the abortion issue and some are further split about how best to deal with the rferendum The Rev Charles Mullins pastor of St Gregorys Roman Catholic Church on the west side of Bristol said he is is absolutely opposed to abortion but disagrees with the idea of a referendum I think its too grandiose too theatrical and too spectacular But the Rev George Ziezukewicz pastor of St Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church in Bristol applauded the referendum Its the American way of doing things he said I think it should give a pretty good signal to legislators and people like that as regards to the feelings of the average person one way or the other William Wholean of the Connecticut Catholic Conference which represents the three dioceses in the state said the church did not plan to get actively involved in the Bristol referendum leaving such work to antiabortion organizations But he said were certainly supportive We like the idea of keeping it in the public eye he said Rabbi Sidney Rothstein of Beth Israel Synagogue in Bristol said he planned to attend Mrs Minors meeting Tuesday night I dont think any legislative body should tell people what to do with their own bodies he said And the Rev Phillip Schnell pastor of Prospect Methodist Church in Bristol said that although he is personally opposed to abortion he will side with the prochoice people in the referendum campaign I feel that the prolife people are forgetting the life of the mother and Im afraid that what they propose will take us back to the days of backalley abortions that will cause loss of lives Reverend Schnell criticized the referendum for being oversimplified There are too many complications and ramifications too many sides to it to put in a few simple words on a referendum on a ballot he said The referendum campaign will coincide with the Bristol mayoral election but both the Democratic and Republican candidates say they will refuse to make abortion part of their campaigns Mayor John J Leone Jr the incumbent Democrat said My feeling will be discussed in the voting booth with the levers His Republican opponent Arthur W Mocabee Jr said I dont want to run for Mayor on the basis of my preference on abortion Its not a municipal or a local issue Mr Mocabee said Mr Leone agreed If you talk about taxes going up or buying a new fire engine those are local issues he said Were not looking for national attention Mayor Leone said of his city We just have an active antiabortion group
SEX EDUCATION: 3 CHOICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/25/nyregion/sex-education-3-choices.html,ELEVENTHand 12thgrade students at Lindenhurst Senior High School this fall will become the first students on Long Island to be able to choose the type of sex education they want The choice is the result of three years of debate between school officials and local residents over the schools health education curriculum a debate that resulted in another sex education programs being dropped Beginning this fall the students must select either a traditional health education course with no discussion of contraception or abortion a health education course called family life which will include three weeks of sex education with such topics as abortion and contraceptives or a health education course with three weeks of conservative sex education during which abortion and contraceptives will not be discussed and the emphasis will be on abstinence According to the Lindenhurst School Superintendent Dr Anthony Pecorale a parent will have to sign the child into one of the three classes If the parent does not sign a student will automatically take the traditional health education course The state requires that all students receive health education but not necessarily sex education While sex education has been a controversial issue in many parts of the country local school officials said that generally that was not the case on Long Island In many areas including New Jersey a single uniform sex education course is taught in all school districts On Long Island however each district is free to develop its own curriculum so many have no sex education courses at all and those that do teach them under different names Lindenhurst incorporated sex education into its health curriculum in 1982 With the permission of parents students in health education spent two to three weeks at the end of each semester in a family life course which included discussion of abortion and contraception Students without parental permission were sent to the library to work on other projects during those weeks We felt we were very successful said Lindenhursts school health education coordinator Lee McLaughlin He said attendance for the threeweek family life course averaged about 93 to 95 percent of the student body However a small group of Lindenhurst citizens opposed to the courses philosophy formed a group called Taxpayers for Responsible and Enlightened Education The groups chairman Carole Mailloux said the family life course was destructive because it was antiparent antidiscipline and value free It does not give a student any reason why they should remain abstinent she went on It puts a traditional barrier between parent and child Children whose parents would not sign them into the family life course were subjected to discrimination according to Mrs Mailloux because they were being pulled out of the class and sent to the library One student who took the course Walter Fischon now a student at the State University of New York at Stony Brook defended it I was never forced to conform to someone elses ideas or morals he said I found nothing obectionable in it Other students said they felt the same way and openly opposed attempts to delete the family life segment Joan Scariati a member of the Lindenhurst School Board during the time the class was offered said that members of the taxpayers group came before the board in 1983 and asked that the program be discontinued The board challenged the group to come up with an alternative to the family life course Months later after a search the opponents returned to the board with the outline of a course called Sexuality Commitment and Family The course which stresses abstinence from sex was taught in schools in the Washington area However the school board declined to adopt the new program at the time it was presented Instead it did nothing In 1984 when Mrs Scariati was president of the school board the family life course was dropped and a health council was formed by the board The councils intent according to Mrs Scariati was to develop a health education program suitable to the community Disputes arose within the health council however and the members could not agree on a program At a school board meeting last July Dr Pecorale proposed the three different health education courses The board which had a new president AJ Scala voted to adopt the Superintendents recommendations with the three classes to start in September Any choice that allows parents to choose is a good one Mr Scala said in reference to the decision The board acted even though Dr Pecorale said at the meeting that the presentation of the new family life course which would include discussion of contraception and abortion was in need of further revision Opponents of the plan predict the dispute will continue because they maintain the two sex education classes to be offered have opposite philosophies Never before in public education has there been recognition for the need for two different programs with two distinct opposing philosophies Mrs Mailloux said She added that the adoption of the threecourse system indicated to her that the past practices of only providing one course were discriminatory and that these family lifetype programs that are generally in schools are in conflict with those who hold traditional values The school district must now start thinking about providing acceptable alternatives if they are really going to address all of the communitys needs The new family life course according to Dr Pecorale is not the one that was previously taught The subject matter will be similar but the presentation and the teacher will be different The original course was taught by Jack Fox who attracted additional controversy when he started holding a health workshop for parents Mr Fox retired last February according to Dr Pecorale Yvonne Rodriguez who is going into the 10th grade at Lindenhurst Senior High this semester and her friend Billy Ruic who is going into the 11th grade both said they would prefer to take the family life option and agreed that the course should be offered People who fool around should be taught what they are getting into said Yvonne who cannot take the course until next year High school students should be taught how to use birth control Its a good thing for people who dont know everything about birth control Billy added Meanwhile the taxpayer group is working to have the family life segment removed from the new courses at the school Mrs Mailloux said her group was also

CARDINAL INSISTS NUNS RETRACT ASBORTION VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/25/us/cardinal-insists-nuns-retract-asbortion-view.html,Twentyfour nuns who contend that Roman Catholics can have differing views on abortion are coming under increasing pressure from the Vatican to retract a public statement they made on the issue and pledge adherence to traditional church teachings The churchs teaching on the radical immorality of direct abortion is clear constant and unequivocal Jean Jerome Cardinal Hamer head of the Vaticans Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes said Friday at the end of a threeweek visit to the United States Cardinal Hamer said the nuns had caused a scandal that could only be remedied by indicating adherence to the teaching of the church Failure to do so he said would result in disciplinary hearings The ultimate penalty would be dismissal from their religious orders The nuns were among 97 people who signed a statement by Catholics for a Free Choice that appeared last Oct 7 as a paid advertisement in The New York Times In that statement the group asserted that a diversity of opinion on abortion existed within the church and called for an open discussion of the abortion issue Second Ad to Be Published The signers said it was the mistaken belief in American society that the only legitimate Catholic position on abortion is that it is morally wrong in all instances Frances Kissling director of Catholics for a Free Choice said another advertisement would be published in The Times this fall with at least 1000 signatures to express solidarity with the right of Catholics to sign such statements He is totally unaware of the nature of political life in America Miss Kissling said of Cardinal Hamer The values of free speech are just not understood Hes causing far more scandal in denying people both moral and political rights than could possibly have been caused by religious people signing such a public statement A month after the advertisement appeared the Vatican called for retractions from the 28 nuns priests and brothers who had signed it Two brothers and two priests the only male clergy who had signed complied with the request but none of the nuns did Loyalty Oaths Cited Miss Kissling said the Vatican seemed to have hardened its stand by adding the demand for indications of adherence to church views a requirement she said was akin to McCarthyism They are being asked to sign loyalty oaths that they adhere to the teachings of the church she said The assumption is that we are disloyal Cardinal Hamer who has been seeking the retractions indirectly through the religious superiors of the nuns who signed the statement said he was encouraged by the good will he had encountered in discussions of the matter this month in the United States Miss Kissling said leaders of the sisters religious communities have not started dismissal proceedings against any members who signed the advertisement She said the unanswered question for everyone is whether the Vatican has the right to dismiss a sister if the head of her order does not begin such proceedings She said the nuns were putting up more resistance to the Vatican demands than men of the Catholic clergy because they felt strong solidarity with women who face the question of abortion In general she said women feel far more alienated and discriminated against within the church and are therefore more willing in some instances to take stands of conscience
"NEW WOMEN, NEW PROBLEMS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/25/books/new-women-new-problems.html,DISORDERLY CONDUCT Visions of Gender in Victorian America By Carroll SmithRosenberg Illustrated 357 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 1995 IN American mythology the 19th century figures as a tale of man against nature an epic of landtaking and taming whose ethos is still compelling Historically however this grand romance coincided with the disruptive process of industrialization and the dislocations of social and family life that it produced The attraction of the myth with its violent heroes and their rejection of civilization may well have been strengthened by the instability of a society groping for new ways of living and new rules for behavior It is not only the stress of such economic social and cultural shifts that Carroll SmithRosenberg a professor of history and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania asks us to consider in this provocative collection of essays It is also the divergent impact industrialization had on men and women and the disorder produced by alterations in gender roles Those alterations she argues extended even to the evolution of separate languages and imagery for members of each sex new forms of expression that contributed too often to mutual misunderstanding Few historians have used the streams of myth and history so productively Mrs SmithRosenbergs examination of female responses to the turmoil disruption and reconstruction of society in the century from 1830 to 1930 enlarges the backward view It also suggests a restructuring of the way we see history by presenting the reactions of men and women to the shock of industrial upheaval and the interplay between their variant visions Such disorder is rich material for analysis and interpretation When home workshops and farms ceased to be economically productive the displaced young left the land in search of livelihood Some went west more flooded into the cities As they did so they left behind structured families ruled by commanding patriarchal figures and they lost the traditional passage into an adult world of work For these new urban workers creating stable new social forms was not easy A male reaction to this instability was expressed in the idolization of such wilderness heroes as Davy Crockett that forerunner of Rambo whose adventures violent racist and sexist were widely celebrated Women dealt with social upheaval differently by creating what Mrs SmithRosenberg calls the female world of love and ritual Sisters female cousins and school friends survived the geographical separation that now often came with marriage by writing letters and traveling long distances to visit In an era when even happy marriages were conditioned by standards of behavior that distanced husbands and wives female friendships nourished emotional communion across miles and years As work drew men out of the home part of the duty of mothering became teaching moral values to the young Not surprisingly some women felt called on to extend the role of moral mentor to the public arena Furthermore a wave of religious revivalism incited female militancy women spoke out in church some even ascended the pulpit A new impulse for reform gave birth to clubs discussion groups and lecture series that while purportedly dealing with household efficiency also took up political questions The American Female Reform Society of the 1830s and 40s attacked a double standard which it felt licensed the male lust that lured poor young women into prostitution and forced good wives to suffer unwanted pregnancies Its members lobbied and demonstrated published journals staffed entirely by women and were the forerunners of abolitionists suffragettes and feminists of later decades The 19thcentury female reformers  the mothers and grandmothers of the New Woman celebrated by Henry James and H G Wells  seemed to be denying their role as guardians of the home How to constrain them in their proper place to fulfill what men termed their sacred duties as mothers and childrearers The medical profession was ready to take a hand Licensed physicians had not yet won full control of the healing arts Beset by competition from such old competitors as herbalists and midwives and from the new homeopaths they legitimized their authority as medical experts by setting up a paradigm of womans essential nature The doctors increased knowledge of anatomy and biology strengthened the normal human tendency to root theories about nature in that bit of it we know so well  the human body Female bodies were clearly designed for reproduction therefore the health and the conduct of women should be governed by the demands of the reproductive system Education outside the home public activity in general were counterindicated The struggle over what sort of destiny female anatomy prescribed is examined here in studies of medical definitions of puberty and menopause of that now largely vanished disease hysteria and of the successful campaign a century ago to illegalize abortion The decision to end a pregnancy had previously been regarded as a private one The interaction of doctrine dogma and prescription in this struggle by medical men to set up social norms is fascinating Mrs SmithRosenberg skillfully weaves together literature memoirs medical texts journalism and social history to present the issues as they affected people at the time Behind them we can sense the sexual politics of an era when new sorts of expertise were being called on to stuff the disturbing female genie back into her bottle the home The author brings her work well into the 20th century At the turn of the century womens colleges and coeducational universities were not only educating mothers and housewivestobe but offering women alternative professional careers One result was a rebirth of intimate connection among those who chose careers over marriage Old female ties were recreated in long and close friendships while college campuses or settlement houses substituted for family homes as Mrs SmithRosenberg points out A change came as this century progressed and attitudes toward sex became more liberal For women the new freedom could be problematic Feminists writes the author can accept one of two quite distinct objectives They can fight for womens rights or they can demand equality with men The women of the 1920s chose the latter path declaring themselves as free of sexual restraints as their brothers ready to both work and love It was a mistaken choice Mrs SmithRosenberg feels their vision of womanasandrogyne was premature Rejecting traditional female ties left the members of this generation isolated from one another while outward assertions of womens equality won little public support They failed she writes because they lacked the real economic and institutional power with which to wrest hegemony from men and so enforce their vision of a genderfree world No doubt but one wonders how many women understood and cherished the revolutionary changes implied by such a program Indeed the phrase covers a multitude of ambiguities I am not sure that power can ever enforce a vision of a genderfree world At the same time it is all too easy for men to assume that to wrest hegemony from them is the total purpose of feminism Be that as it may this is a splendid book The disorder that arises from disparate languages for behavior based on contrasting experiences of life and the misapprehensions they create will be lessened by

STOP THE CENSORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/29/opinion/stop-the-censors.html,Its no secret that a lot of people in this country are spending a lot of their time keeping an eagle eye on what students read But theres evidence that the number of selfprofessed censors is growing and that the scope of their surveillance is expanding Its a depressing trend worth noting as a new school term begins During the 198485 academic year cultural vigilantes in no less than 46 of the 50 states tried to delete material they found objectionable from school curriculums and to remove books they found dangerous The Catcher in the Rye caught it again from library shelves In New York State alone there were five reported incidents of censorship Two of the five resulted in the banning of material In the town of Bradford Stephen Kings Cujo was banished from the high school library One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest suffered the same fate in Troy To the surprise of no one who follows these matters J D Salingers little classic The Catcher in the Rye was again labeled the dirtiest book ever written and removed from a high school English class in Florida But the casual observer might be surprised to learn that the nations publishers of basic high school literature anthologies have deleted approximately 400 lines from various parts of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet Similarly after complaints about nudity the movie version of Romeo and Juliet was edited before it could be shown to students in Troy with scenes judged offensive ending up on the cuttingroom floor Although the majority of last years censorship efforts came from moral outriders on the right leftwing ideologues were by no means asleep In Berkeley Calif the school board rejected a Latin American history textbook on the grounds that the book was antiSoviet In one high school in Kansas the novel To Kill A Mockingbird was deemed offensive to blacks In Missouri the same book was attacked for its exploration of bigotry and prejudice The censorship of written material is hardly new But more and more selfstyled guardians of public morality seem to be aiming their fire at courses and activities designed to help our young people deal with the practical problems of contemporary life In most cases their targets suffered symptoms of a disease the crusaders call secular humanism an allpurpose phrase used by rightwing censors to describe any book or other form of teaching material that in their view is mancentered as opposed to Godcentered and is therefore unacceptable In California for example a lawsuit was filed seeking an injunction against a successful drug abuse program that in the eyes of its critics promoted secular humanism In New York State similar complaints against a program aimed at ending child abuse and neglect teenage pregnancy juvenile crime and alcohol and drug abuse succeeded in keeping the program out of one districts schools In Georgia complaints about secular humanism prompted a school superintendent to prohibit classroom discussion about homosexuality and abortion and to restrict discussion of evolution witchcraft religion values and personal inquiries to what was contained in approved textbooks The Federal Government has done little to discourage these efforts and indeed may have reinforced them In his first news conference as Education Secretary William J Bennett said There are a lot of things in schools that dont belong there Organized censors seized on his words as a Federal green light for their drive to clean up the curriculum They also found comfort in various Federal regulations including an amendment to the Education for Economic Security Act of 1984 that prohibited the use of certain Federal funds for the teaching of secular humanism Those who say that books and ideas are dangerous for our children  and that education should do little more than impart basic skills  seem to know little about kids less about learning and not much about democracy The idea that school is a place for learning and discussing anything but approved material is becoming a new brand of unAmerican activity Whats at stake here is whether Americas children will continue to have the freedom to ask questions as well as the opportunity to learn the facts that are handed to them Educational excellence as well as democracy depends on both

COALITION SEEKS HIGH COURT SUPPORT ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/01/us/coalition-seeks-high-court-support-on-abortion.html,Offering the vivid memories of women who had illegal abortions a coalition of abortionrights groups has filed a brief asking the Supreme Court to reaffirm its 1973 decision legalizing abortion The brief filed Friday included excerpts from letters from women about their abortions an extraordinary move for a filing with the Court The National Abortion Rights Action League and other groups in the coalition said the excerpts would help to place the realities of abortion in womens lives before this Court The brief filed as a friend of the Court was submitted as an answer to one filed by the Reagan Administration in July urging a reversal of the 1973 ruling Roe v Wade The Court is scheduled to study cases on abortion laws from Pennsylvania and Illinois after it begins its 198586 term in October Although those cases do not directly challenge the 1973 ruling the Administrations brief said that the Court should seize the opportunity to declare that its action establishing a constitutional right to abortion has proved inherently unworkable Federal Ban Sought on Abortions Lawyers for the Department of Justice asked the Court to return the law to the condition which it was before Jan 22 1973 when the decision in Roe v Wade was announced That would leave states free to impose whatever limits they deemed appropriate including banning all abortions except those necessary to save a womans life In a separate brief filed Friday as a friend of the Court 81 members of Congress asked the Court to reject the Administrations invitation to overturn the 1973 ruling The Government would have the Supreme Court toss into the political arena the right to choose between childbirth and abortion the lawmakers contended The Government would relegate this delicate constitutional matter to shifting political majorities in the 50 state legislatures yielding a bizarre quilt of wildly varying state laws Fear for Womens Lives The groups favoring the right to choose abortion said in their brief that the Administration was seeking to return to a condition in which hundreds of women will die each year from illegal abortions and thousands will have to risk their lives or be forced to endure unwanted pregnancies I remember Tijuana said one letter included in the brief I remember bugs crawling on walls a stinking cesspool of urine sweat filthy sheets and bugs Where else could I have gone in 1963 In another letter a woman described her abortionist as an alcoholic who was drinking throughout the procedure a whisky glass in one hand a sharp instrument in the other She said that after the operation he offered her 20 off his 1000 fee if she would perform oral sex One letter said On Nov 18 1971 my twin sister Rose Elizabeth died from an illegal abortion This was after a very brutal rape I believe if there had been a place where women especially young women could have gone for an abortion where the environment was safe and clean Rose Elizabeth would still would be with us today The brief said that the letters do not constitute sworn testimony or record evidence adding They do provide an invaluable source of information about the lives of women who choose to have an abortion
TWO CEREMONIES REFLECT A DIVISION ON WOMEN'S ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/01/nyregion/two-ceremonies-reflect-a-division-on-women-s-issues.html,FOR the first time in the 13 years that Womens Equality Day has been celebrated in the county separate ceremonies were held two hours apart last week reopening old divisions between County Executive Andrew ORourke and some feminist organizations The 21member ad hoc Coalition for Womens Equality Day a looseknit group of womens organizations continued a 13year tradition of honoring a Woman of the Year and a Project of the Year Mr ORourke and the Womens Advisory Board a group created oneandahalfyears ago to advise the County Executive and the Board of Legislators on womens issues held a separate ceremony honoring county women who have been elected to school and municipal government positions While membership in the coalition changes from year to year all organizations that participate support freedom of choice on reproductive issues and the proposed equal rights amendment Members of the Womens Advisory Board are appointed both by the County Executive and by members of the Board of Legislators and they hold varying positions on reproductive freedom and on the proposed equal rights amendment Mr ORourke did not attend the coalitionsponsored ceremony nor did Camille Murphy director of the Westchester County Office for Women In an interview before the ceremony Mr ORourke said his invitation had stated a commitment to abortion and the ERA and I thought it not appropriate to limit an invitation to one point of view so Im not going Calling Mr ORourkes action a political mistake Polly Rothstein director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion and cochairman of the Coalition for Womens Equality Day said that the equal rights amendment and reproductive choice had not been discussed in Mr ORourkes invitation The letter to Mr ORourke simply continued a custom established in 1973 inviting the County Executive to make his usual proclamation Mrs Rothstein said Mr ORourke has snubbed 21 organizations representing many thousands of women in Westchester She called the other ceremony a publicity stunt from a man who opposes basic womens rights and a glossy show for a political purpose The day marking the 65th anniversary of womens right to vote began with a Courthouse ceremony sponsored by the Westchester Womens Advisory Board at which Mr ORourke proclaimed Monday Womens Equality Day in the County The Board of Legislators presented certificates to women officials elected to municipal and school positions and Judge Ruth V Washington issued a call for women to regroup and spark a new impetus for the womens movement Judge Washington a United States Magistrate in the Southern District of New York is one of only two minority women magistrates in the nation Two hours later the coalition of womens groups ranging from BNai BRith Women to the League of Women Voters to the Westchester Womens Bar Association gathered in the community room of the Galleria to honor its 1985 Woman of the Year Melinda A Bass a White Plains attorney and its Project of the Year Women in SelfHelp a telephone peercounseling and referral service Mrs Bass was recognized for her pioneering role in the womens movement in Westchester Mr ORourkes relations with womens organizations in the county have been uneasy since the 1983 Coalition for Womens Equality Day picked the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion as its Project of the Year One of the organizations participating in that selection process was the Westchester Womens Council a group formed by former County Executive Alfred Del Bello to advise him on womens issues After he won election as County Executive Mr ORourke disbanded the 10yearold council and replaced it with the Womens Advisory Board At that time Mr ORourke said the new board would provide a better vehicle to enunciate concerns Last year the Womens Advisory Board did not participate in the coalitions selection process but celebrated Womens Equality Day by conducting a voter registration drive at five locations Sharon Frayne chairman of the board said it produced several hundred new voters Underlying the boards celebration of Womens Equality Day Mrs Frayne said was an effort to recognize a group of women involved in government and education throughout Westchester Drawing a distinction between the boards activities and those of the coalition she said We are advisors to county government so we focus on women in the plural while the Womens Equality Day Coalition honors a single woman and a single project But there is certainly room for both in the county Mrs Frayne suggested that women must work on issues that unite them rather than focusing on divisive issues such as abortion and the equal rights amendment Why after all do we want a woman on the Supreme Court she said So she can vote our way or so she can use her special sensitivities and skills on that court Speakers at both ceremonies last week appealed to Westchester women to increase their power at the polls by joining forces Melinda Bass observed If we continue electing women to Congressional seats at the same rate as the past 20 years it will be the year 2395 before we have equal representation Judge Washington said We must overflow the ballot box and inspire others to follow Hoping to form a coalition like the one Judge Washington envisioned several womens organizations in the county have joined together to form the Every Womans Coalition Women in this county are fighting on too many fronts JoAnn Kantrowitz a member of the coalition said adding that the group was designed to help feminists coalesce and to prevent the power wielders in both parties from compromising womens issues A recent organizational meeting attracted representatives from six womens organizations the National Organization for Women Women of Westchester the Westchester Chapter of the National Womens Political Caucus the Yonkers Womens Task Force the Black Womens Political Caucus and the Association for Women in Psychology The organizational concept was endorsed by County Legislator Sandra Galef who said I havent seen womens groups cooperatively lobby on an issue Noting that the effort to unite womens groups in the county would be easier if opinion were not divided over abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment she added Theres a budget coming up How does it affect women Day care may be cut and there are new positions coming on line Will women fill those positions and will they receive comparable pay Women in Westchester havent structured how they can lobby the Board of Legislators for what they believe in and they need to develop a strategy
L.I. A STAGE FOR ABORTION FIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/01/nyregion/li-a-stage-for-abortion-fight.html,EVERY Saturday for the last few months antiabortion activists have picketed the Hempstead Professional Building which houses an abortion clinic and a counseling service the Bill Baird Institute associated with it Mr Baird who in 1965 opened the countrys first abortion clinic on Long Island is an outspoken advocate of the right of women to undergo the procedure In recent weeks the abortion protesters have grown in number and their demonstrations have become noisier making patients run a gantlet to gain access to the abortion clinic and Mr Bairds offices in the Village of Hempstead In turn Mr Baird has mustered his own supporters to counterpicket In scenes similar to those at abortion clinics all over Long Island and around the country it has become routine for both sides to march chant slogans and jeer at each other across barricades set up by police officers Several weeks ago a man dressed as a storm trooper goosestepped on the picket line and gave the Nazi salute to offended passersby The same day another man marched with a placard that read Army of God The Army of God is an organization that has taken responsibility for firebomb attacks against clinics across the country Mr Baird whose clinic was firebombed in 1979 predicted that this harassment of women this violation of their civil rights will escalate much further The frustrations are such on both sides he said that the outcome could result in a shooting war Charging that antiabortion activists were being trained to invade abortion centers Mr Baird said that if they ever enter his clinic I will fight them to the death Twelve years after the United States Supreme Court legalized abortion the conflict over the issue appears to be growing on Long Island which is considered a stronghold of the antiabortion forces The Island for example is the home of Ellen McCormack the former Right to Life Presidential candidate and the home also of a strong Right to Life Party The antiabortion movement is fighting to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade that upheld a womans constitutionally protected right to have an abortion Instead it wants a constitutional amendment declaring the right of the unborn  from conception  to legal protection Because the same goal could be reached by changing the composition of the Supreme Court the antiabortion forces are hoping that with two justices expected to retire President Reagan will appoint two conservative justices who would help form an antiabortion majority The Reagan Administration recently submitted a brief to the Supreme Court asking the panel to reverse Roe v Wade The weekly demonstrations in Hempstead echo confrontations taking place at all nine abortion clinics on Long Island these days but the operators of other clinics interviewed  some declined to talk to a reporter  said that by and large the demonstrators had not increased For example the administrator at the Womens Pavilion in Deer Park who gave her name only as Gail said the clinic had been picketed by small groups for years Because of threats against abortion clinics she said including a bomb threat that forced patients to evacuate the Baird Center in Hauppauge her facility recently hired an armed guard We prefer being anonymous she said While we all stand behind Bill Baird he wants to call attention to himself We dont For his part Mr Baird calls these more cautious clinic operators abortion wimps A prolific speaker he travels the lecture circuit gives interviews and appears on television talk shows As a result he may have become a special target of antiabortion groups Mr Baird has asked the New York State Attorney Generals office and the Nassau County District Attorney to investigate the militant tactics of abortion foes and specifically a secret meeting of the Right to Life group that he said took place recently on Long Island While Mr Baird cannot substantiate the charge he has accused delegates to the 1980 national Right to Life convention of conspiring to bomb clinics Charles Williamson of Bellmore chairman of the Right to Life Long Island Coalition said no firebombings had ever been linked to his and similar groups We never enter clinics he said The violence takes place within the abortion clinic In 1983 in Nassau County 8767 women had abortions down from 9979 in 1982 according to the Nassau Health Department Suffolk County saw a similar random fluctuation in 1983 said a Suffolk Health Department spokesman when 8841 abortions were recorded compared with 10056 in 1982 Figures for 1984 were not available Mr Williamson said demonstrations had increased at the Hempstead facility Mr Baird operates one other clinic in Hauppauge and one in Boston because people affiliated with a South Shore branch of an evangelical church want to work the Hempstead clinic In addition he said growing numbers of students are now active in supporting alternatives to abortion more In a recent interview Denis E Dillon the Nassau County District Attorney an antiabortion advocate who acknowledged that he is active in doing everything I can to get a constitutional amendment passed said he nevertheless understood Mr Bairds concern about people who seek his care being terrorized Although abortionrelated violence has exploded nationwide no recent incidents have been reported on Long Island Mr Dillon said his office was investigating specific incidents of harassment because there is more trespassing on the grounds of abortion clinics The office also will investigate Mr Bairds concern that some demonstrators such as the man who recently paraded in Nazi uniform may be supported by neoNazi funds But Mr Dillon noted that his office must walk a fine line between Mr Bairds concern about violence and peoples constitutional right to demonstrate Mary Ellen Burns deputy chief of the public advocacy division in the Attorney Generals office said the agency was evaluating Mr Bairds complaints but had limited jurisdiction in the matter She said the office had urged the Justice Department to act under a Federal statute prohibiting people from conspiring to intimidate others in the exercise of their constitutional rights At 930 AM on a recent Saturday four village police officers arrived at the Hempstead Professional Building at 131 Fulton Street and set up barricades We dont mind if they demonstrate as long as its peaceful their point is made within the guidelines of the law and they dont harass pedestrians Sgt George Petri said of the antiabortion protesters He was drinking coffee in Pearls Luncheonette situated in the Professional Building and fronting on the street Pearl Weiskopf the restaurant owner was less sanguine She complained that when customers see the commotion they keep away Our business is off said Karen Newman assistant manager of General Vision Services situated on the same block We are trying to fix eyeglasses they are chanting Their tapes are blasting We Are the World  Mrs Weiskopf said that what really gets my blood boiling was that fellow dressed as a Nazi  a real disgrace The other fellow she said he comes every week He shows pictures of unborn children People dont want to eat The other fellow is Bill Woolever of Valley Stream a member of the Nazarene Church He has been demonstrating at the building for a year he said six days a week Mr Woolever distributes pamphlets showing the progress of a fetus in a womb and antiabortion symbols such as a tiny metal emblem called precious feet identical in size he said to those of an unborn baby 10 weeks after conception In the early days he said few people walked with him on the picket line But that Saturday he was joined by people of all ages including a sprinkling of college students One frail elderly woman toted a heavy sign for two hours in a broiling sun The sign read Kill her now and it is murder Kill her three months ago and it is called an abortion At 10 oclock the confrontation began quietly Chants such as Abortion is murder would come later Joe Wiener 21 years old of Malverne president of the Hofstra University ProLife Club who was raised as a Quaker said his protest was not religious but a moral one involving human rights Another Hofstra student Kathleen Kelly who described herself as a Gandhi believer in nonviolence argued that while abortion is legal it is not a human right Under no circumstances would I have an abortion Miss Kelly said What about rape someone asked You dont sentence a child to death because his father is a rapist she answered firmly On the other side of the building Mr Bairds group in the main composed of women in their 30s who described themselves as feminists and civil libertarians were joined for the first time by South Shore members of the National Organization for Women Looking pleased Mr Baird said that for once the prochoice people just might outnumber the antiabortion group Fifteen people marched with him 16 marched on the other side Hatti Smyler a NOW member from Glen Cove carried a sign proclaiming The American way Keep abortion legal After three kids and three grandchildren she said she was prochoice Her pregnant daughter marched with her Shell stay pregnant the mother commented because that is her choice At 1030 a slim man in dark glasses wearing khaki shorts was pointed out He was Tim McDonough 20 an Adelphi University student He lives somewhere in Nassau he said He said he bought a Nazi uniform in a local ArmyNavy store and wore it a few weeks ago on the picket line Mr McDonough who said he had almost been an abortion myself attempted to explain why he made what he conceded was an ugly statement To show that these people are the moral equivalent of Nazis To bring out that what is going on here is worse than the Holocaust because they are killing 16 million of our children Some people on the picket line took issue with the remark Earlier Mr Woolever had disassociated himself from Mr McDonough saying He is too radical He is not with my group Im a gentle person maintained Mr McDonough who said he was a philosophy major If Im in the shower and see a spider Ill push him over the curtain But he conceded that he had mixed emotions on the issue of firebomb attacks against clinics because he said his primary goal was to save babies Meanwhile Ken Bresnan had joined the picket line Wearing an airline cap and draped in an American flag he was being admonished by the police The American flag is not to be stuffed in your pants he was told Wave it carry it or put it in your car Mr Bresnan a 21yearold Hofstra student said he did not know about the Army of God until fellow marchers informed him I read that Baird was being attacked by it so I thought I would make up a sign he said Once I heard it was an organized group I put it away At noon after the antiabortion group had said a prayer and recited the Pledge of Allegiance the demonstration ended While no one had played strident tapes screamed epithets or copied down license plates both sides say such conduct regularly occurs  some unpleasant words were exchanged One incident involved Mr Woolever who was still handing out precious feet emblems Mr Baird yelled Bill they are as false as your ideas A woman angrily asked Mr Woolever How many babies have you given birth to Mr Woolever did not reply but continued to distribute antiabortion material He said he expected to be around quite a while
PROFESSORS ASSESS REAGAN AS LEADER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/02/us/professors-assess-reagan-as-leader.html,The Reagan Presidency received mixed reviews from a panel of scholars at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association Some of the scholars credited President Reagan with changing the nations priorities renewing a sense of national pride and showing that the Presidency can work Mr Reagans political skills and operating style were likened to those of Franklin Delano Roosevelt But most of those on the panel Thursday agreed that the Reagan Presidency had been vastly overrated and had created fiscal and foreignpolicy problems for future generations Also overrated they agreed was the theory that holds that political attacks slide off Mr Reagan like eggs off Teflon One panelist Prof John H Kessel of Ohio State University likened Mr Reagan to John Diefenbaker a Canadian Prime Minister in the 1950s and 1960s whose ascent was heralded and whose administration was praised but who is now all but forgotten Style vs Substance The professors distinguished between what they called Mr Reagans style which they praised and his substantive achievements which they found wanting Prof Larry Berman of the University of California at Davis was the most enthusiastic of the group in praising the President Ronald Reagan is the most successful and most underestimated political leader since Franklin Delano Roosevelt Mr Berman said Ronald Reagan has clearly reshaped the dialogue on the national agenda he continued Were looking at a fundamental alteration in domestic priorities Professor Berman said afterward that many of his colleagues had failed to appreciate the Reagan Presidency because they opposed his policies The Reagan Presidency in particular is a problem for most political scientists he said because his policies undercut so many of our views on domestic policy A Negative Assessment Prof Stephen Wayne of George Washington University offered the most negative assessment of the President I think history will not view the Reagan Presidency in the same glow that it is viewed today Mr Wayne said How can a person so inattentive to details ignorant of facts and personally disengaged be viewed as a strong leader Where is the idealism of the 60s Mr Wayne asked Where is the leadership one looks to to extend basic American values individual dignity equal opportunity and equal rights sensitivity for the less fortunate Like Mr Berman Prof Fred L Greenstein of Princeton University compared Mr Reagans style with that of Roosevelt I am struck by the surface similarity between Ronald Reagan and the person for whom he cast his first vote FDR Mr Greenstein said The Reagan operation seems to have a striking professionalism Mr Greenstein continued They both had a capacity for impressive dramatics On economics both men were similarly ignorant No Taste for Intrigue Mr Greenstein added however that whereas Roosevelt loved intrigue Mr Reagan showed no such disposition The professor also noted that Roosevelt became deeply immersed in the development of programs appointed people with competing ideas and assigned tasks to several appointees to see who would come up with the best solution Prof Norman Thomas of the University of Cincinatti said On the process side Im very positive about Ronald Reagan Hes effective in dealing with Congress He has rapport with the American people He gives the appearance of a firm hand on the tiller But the professor said that he was distressed by the substantive side of the Reagan Presidency He said the budget and trade deficits represented a fiscal catastrophe Ronald Reagans foreign policy can only be described as a fiasco Mr Thomas added There are no significant accomplishments Mr Kessel of Ohio State said Mr Reagan had largely ignored the heart of the conservatives social agenda support for prayer in the schools and opposition to abortion and to mandatory busing for school desegregration Mr Kessel said most of the Reagan changes had been administrative without the permanence of law On the other hand Mr Kessel said Ronald Reagan gets credit for showing that the Presidency could work

NEW YORK URGEGES HIGH COURT TO AFFIRM ABORTION DECISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/04/us/new-york-urgeges-high-court-to-affirm-abortion-decision.html,Robert Abrams New York States Attorney General has filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its 1973 decision legalizing abortion and to reject the Reagan Administrations arguments for overruling that precedent The brief was mailed Friday from New York City and was received and filed at the Court today Also today Laurence H Tribe the Harvard Law Professor who filed a brief on behalf of 81 members of Congress Friday supporting abortion rights said at a news conference here that the Administrations legal arguments if adopted would undermine other privacy rights including the right to use contraception as well as abolishing abortion rights Mr Abrams brief said that if the Court accepted the Administrations position and left the issue of abortion to the state legislatures New York and other states choosing to uphold such a right would be faced with meeting an enormous demand for the service from outofstate residents His brief is the latest of more than a dozen briefs filed as friends of the Court by groups supporting and opposing abortion rights in two cases that the Court has agreed to review in the term beginning Oct 7 State Laws at Issue The cases involve Pennsylvania and Illinois laws that regulated abortion in various ways including requirements that physicians use methods most likely to keep possibly viable fetuses alive Federal appellate courts have struck down the laws saying they were inconsistent with Supreme Court precedents going back to the 1973 decision that legalized abortion Roe v Wade The Justice Department filed a brief in July in connection with the two cases urging the Court to overturn Roe v Wade and to return the law to the condition in which it was before that case was decided The Court ruled in that 1973 decision that a womans right to choose abortion was part of a right of privacy guaranteed by the Constitution and that the Government could not restrict abortions by licensed physicians in the first three months of pregnancy The decision invalidated dozens of state laws that had made abortion a crime and otherwise restricted abortion rights The Court reaffirmed Roe v Wade in 1983 by a 6to3 vote The Justice Departments July brief consistent with Administration policy said that Roe v Wade was an arbitrary exercise in judicial policymaking without support in the language or history of the Constitution Right to Privacy Cited Mr Abramss brief said the departments arguments ignore a firmly established line of precedent protecting our rights to be left alone by government to choose how to conduct our own lives and to decide for ourselves when and whether to marry or to conceive or bear children Both Mr Tribe and Mr Abrams argued that the Administrations position was inconsistent with a 60yearold line of decisions holding that the Constitution protects the rights to use contraceptives and to a zone of family privacy in marriage procreation and childrearing

A CATHOLIC-ANGLICAN PANEL TAKES A KEY STEP TOWARD RECONCILIATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/06/nyregion/a-catholic-anglican-panel-takes-a-key-step-toward-reconciliation.html,In an important step toward a reconciliation between the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches a highlevel commission of theologians said today that they were close to an agreement on the spiritual means of attaining salvation The issue is among those that have divided the churches since the Reformation in the 16th century A principal source of conflict has been the question of justification  whether salvation in heaven can be attained by simple faith as many Protestants assert or whether it depends on a believers good works as Catholics hold On Faith Grace and Conduct An eventual accord according to members of the commission would recognize that salvation depends on faith and the grace of God but that its attainment is helped by personal conduct Members of the commission who have met for the last 10 days at a Franciscan monastery here emphasized today that the two churches did not differ greatly over the theology of salvation and that groups within each church had seen the split as sharper than it actually was The panel  the Second AnglicanRoman Catholic International Commission  was established in 1982 by Pope John Paul II and the Most Rev Robert Runcie the Archbishop of Canterbury the titular leader of the 63 million Anglicans in communion with the Church of England No Single Church Planned The panel met at the Catholic monastery of Graymoor 55 miles north of New York City on a mountain lush with trees and shrubs overlooking the lower Hudson Valley Anglicans and Catholics are aiming not so much toward a single church but rather toward two bodies that can recognize the legitimacy of each others clergy the validity of each others rites and the privilege of worshiping fully at each others churches Yet with issues such as the ordination of women abortion and the scope of papal power dividing the churches the members of the commission indicated they had no illusions that such mutual recognition could be achieved in a matter of years A Long Road to Travel Some Anglican branches such as the Episcopal Church ordain women and respect the right of women to choose abortions The Catholic Church refuses to ordain women and prohibits abortion as the taking of life As an indication of the long road they have yet to travel 6 members of the 24member commission told of the sense of loss they felt as they attended and prayed at each others worship services but could not share in the others eucharistic meal of bread and wine There is a profound sense of each others unity and of each others pain said Bishop Cormac MurphyOConnor the Roman Catholic Bishop of Arundel and Brighton in England who is cochairman of the commission The commission said it expected to complete a document of agreement next year when it met near Cardiff Wales They said the differences remaining were a matter of language and punctuation subtleties rather than of doctrine A final agreement would have to be ratified by the hierarchies of both churches The Anglican Church was created 450 years ago when Henry VIII defied a papal ban on his marriage and established a breakaway state church The Anglican Communion includes Americas 3 million Episcopalians There are 725 million Catholics around the world Moves toward reconciliation flowed from the Second Vatican Council of the early 1960s and began in earnest in 1966 when Pope Paul VI and the Most Rev Michael Ramsey then the Archbishop of Canterbury opened what they called a dialogue over the theological and practical issues that separated the churches Papal Visit to Canterbury In March 1982 the first Anglican Catholic International Commission after 12 years of work reached substantial agreement on the eucharist and ministry and convergence on the issue of hierarchical authority Its work is being evaluated by both churches adoption may be several years off The momentum toward reconciliation was hastened after Pope John Paul II visited Dr Runcie at Canterbury England in 1982 and the two men embraced and prayed together Because of the papal visit people are suddenly realizing God it could actually happen there could be a full reconciliation  said the Bishop Mark Santer the Anglican Bishop of Kensington who is the commissions other chairman Bishop Santer speaking of salvation pointed out that the controversy over justification by faith began as Martin Luthers quarrel with the Catholic Church The Catholic Church rejected justification by faith alone in the 1547 decree of the Council of Trent which said that sinners could not simply claim righteousness but must work to become righteous A Sensitive Issue Although the doctrine of justification by faith was adopted by other Protestants it was not fully embraced as a tenet of the Anglican Church and arose as a seriously divisive issue only in the 19th century At the time the growing Evangelical Anglican movement in England Ireland and Australia stressing personal commitment to Jesus and individual conversion clung to the concept of salvation by Gods grace alone It was the sensitive matter of not alienating the Evangelical Anglicans that posed the trickiest problem for the commission Bishop Santer said Four of the commissions Anglican members ally themselves with the Evangelical movement The goal the commission set for itself added the Rev Robert Wright a professor of church history at the General Theological Seminary in Manhattan was a much broader reunited church in which Evangelicals would also be happy because they were convinced that Roman Catholics also believed that they are justified by faith An Emphasis on Grace Bishop Santer said the commissions expected agreement on the issue would emphasize that our salvation depends on the grace of God Yet he said the grace of God really does evoke a human response which is of value in the eyes of God The human response would presumably be the personal conduct that would help attain salvation In September 1983 a group of Lutheran and Catholic theologians in the United States made a landmark agreement on justification They said people could not earn salvation by actions alone but such actions were important in Gods plan for salvation Graymoor is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Society of Atonement which has long been active in the ecumenical movement It was originally an Episcopal friary according to the Rev Blase Burniston the director of public relations but its members converted to Catholicism and devoted themselves to a reunion of the two faiths

EPISCOPALIANS TO CHOOSE NEW LEADER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/07/us/episcopalians-to-choose-new-leader.html,The Episcopal Church opens its General Convention today across a broad parking lot from Disneyland in Anaheim Calif and the setting although entirely coincidental still reflects the more relaxed mood of the church after weathering the conflicts of the past two decades The main focus of attention is not an uncomfortable political or doctrinal quarrel but the election of a new presiding bishop the churchs leader for perhaps the next 12 years Four bishops have been nominated for the job and leading members of the church say there is no clear favorite in the race In recent conventions the church has found itself torn over the ordination of women the modernizing of its prayer book and its attitude towards homosexuality But the church has worked out positions on those issues Discontent lingersbut few members feel there will be any dramatic shifts of policy The convention which is held every three years has implications beyond the church itself Although the church has about 28 million members those members wield power far greater than their numbers Studies several years ago showed that Episcopalians American inheritors of the Anglican tradition head 20 percent of the companies on Fortune magazines list of the 500 largest industrial corporations and head onethird of the major banks Eleven Episcopalians have become President of the United States Potential Influence on US The moral urgings of church leaders while hardly binding might influence many national leaders at a time the church is grappling with what the United States policy should be on South Africa Central America and nuclear arms Indeed church spokesmen pride themselves on the number of bank executives who have been persuaded to cut off loans to South Africa The presiding bishop does not wield authority like that of the Pope in Roman Catholicism The General Convention a legislature where 150 bishops sit in one house and 800 elected lay people and clergy in another determines the churchs laws and the presiding bishop carries out its will Bishop Paul Moore Jr of New York said in a telephone interview that the presiding bishop has enormous influence and will serve as the churchs national representative and set priorities for expending its energy and money John E Hines the activist presiding bishop of the late 1960s and early 1970s poured funds into nonchurch organizations of black and Hispanic groups angering members who felt a proper fiscal accounting had not been made John M Allin 65 who is retiring in December as presiding bishop dedicated his efforts to reconciling the church and is widely admired for raising 170 million for social service and missionary projects Four Vie for Top Role The four candidates selected by a search committee to succeed Bishop Allin who was from Mississippi were all born in the South and not one is so old that his term will be quickly cut short by the mandated retirement age of 65 One of these Bishop Edmond Lee Browning of Hawaii a 56yearold Texan has developed overseas experience important in the internationally conscious church He wasBishop of Okinawa for three years and also was the bishop to the American churches in Europe Another Bishop William Carl Frey 55 of Colorado has been allied with the churchs growing charismatic movement whose followers stress a more personal experience of faith Yet Bishop Frey also born in Texas is difficult to pigeonhole in the churchs conservative wing because he heads the churchs peace committee and was expelled by the Guatemalan Government in 1971 for protesting killings of civilians He has cultivated enemies among conservative Episcopalians because of a much publicized battle he is waging with a priest the Rev Louis Tarsitano of Denver who prefers the Elizabethan 1928 prayer book to the 1979 prayer book The third Bishop Furman Charles Stough 57 of Alabama is regarded as a liberal on social issues In the early 60s he helped to promote contacts between black and white leaders and he has been an opponent of capital punishment in Alabama He is highly regarded as a fundraiser The fourth Bishop John Thomas Walker 60 of Washington DC became the first black Episcopal bishop in Washingotn and would be the first black presiding bishop Bishop Walker who was born in Georgia has excellent contacts in Washington and is also wellregarded as a fundraiser having dissolved the 10 million debt of the National Cathedral the seat of his diocese About 600 Women Are Priests When the election is settled the tension over policy should be limited The 1976 convention authorized the ordination of women about 600 women are now priests 150 of them who head congregations Still bishops who feel they cannot in conscience ordain women are not compelled to do so under church law Women in such bishops dioceses have to leave the home diocese if they want to function as priests It says to women that somehow in some place they are less than capable of receiving orders and that says something profoundly damaging and something profoundly inconsistent with the Gospel said Rev Betty Bone Schiess rector of Grace Episcopal Church in Mexico New York one of the first women to be ordained Liberal bishops are afraid to oppose the church law on this point because reopening the issue might yield setbacks Moreover womens ordination is entangled with the efforts to achieve reconciliation between the worldwide Anglican Communion and Roman Catholicism The Catholic Church and most national Anglican churches do not ordain women The ordaining of homosexuals also is at issue but the churchs ambiguous stand prohibiting ordination of practicing homosexuals has not posed barriers to some bishops who want to ordain homosexuals An organization of Episcopalians who oppose abortion is expected to make an effort to alter the churchs relatively permissive stand on abortion More language in the liturgy that refers to people in the masculine could be trimmed out and an effort could be made to broaden use of the 1928 prayer book But essentially the mood of the convention is expected to be optimistic I think were fine Bishop Moore said Were strong and were growing
FOREIGHN-BORN PRIESTS FIGHT FOR ACCEPTANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/nyregion/foreighnborn-priests-fight-for-acceptance.html,THE Rev Antonio S Pascual who came to Elmont from the Phiippines in 1975 to serve the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre sometimes tells a joke to describe the plight of foreignborn priests on Long Island Father Pascual by all accounts a popular priest among his parishioners at St Boniface Church joked that the long line at his confession booth may be because people think I dont understand them As the corps of Long Island priests who were born in the United States ages and dwindles and as fewer men enter the ministry a growing number of foreignborn Roman Catholic priests like Father Pascual have immigrated here both to fill the void in the diocese the secondlargest diocese in the country and to follow their dreams of a better life While their contributions are not questioned some say they have not met with total acceptance both among parishioners and some Americanborn priests primarily because of their difficulty with the language In many senses I still feel like an outsider Father Pascual said Americanborn parish priests say that questions about the necessity for foreignborn priests are often raised by parishioners The Rev James P Lisante director of the dioceses Respect Life Programs which oppose abortion and help women find alternatives acknowledged that not enough American men are joining the church to replace those who die or retire There are about 100 foreign priests on Long Island from more than 18 countries including Kenya Poland Peru Sri Lanka and Vietnam according to the diocese Many say they find the cultural differences between nationalities a challenge But Father Pascual said he has observed among a small number of Americanborn priests a colonial mentality a feeling of  Im good to you because Im better than you are  Part of their reasoning Father Pascual said is that some foreigners myself included dont speak that well The Rev Mamerto Soriano associate pastor at St Christophers Church in Baldwin who left the Philippines nine years ago for what he called political reasons agreed there was a problem There is a subtle way of looking at things that makes communication difficult he said It is not exactly a prejudice but a remark is made Because of our history and culture it means something different to an Asiatic than an American Last year a 14week English language program was initiated by the diocese and given at Molloy College in Rockville Centre for foreign priests Particular attention was given to critiquing the priests homilies While most of the foreign priests speak at least fair English some speak it poorly There is no minimum English proficiency level required for the priests who come to Long Island Some foreignborn priests say another problem they face is the lack of promotions On Long Island none of the priests from thirdworld countries is a pastor  a priest who runs his own parish  although some were pastors in their homelands A handful of priests from Ireland and Italy do head parishes here Some of the priests said they believed they were not ready for a parish But others indicated that the church is not ready for them to assume greater responsibilities I give a big consideration to the communication problem said Father Soriano who recently celebrated his 25th year as a priest I dont know if Im ready for a parish Msgr Peter Pflomm director of the Ministry to Priests in the diocese said that after 10 years of being in the diocese and being incardinated becoming a full member of the diocese not just a visitor  priests may apply to become pastors Some foreignborn priests he said see some injustice involving promotions but are reticent about speaking up Realistically he said chances depend on proficiency in English effectiveness as a diocesan priest and having a sense of the American culture There was a time Monsignor Pflomm said when American missionaries who went to other countries were the pastors because there were no native clergy In a sense our Americanborn clergy now are the native clergy But as we become older and fewer he predicted opportunities for promotion should open up more and more for our foreignborn priests There are many reasons that foreign priests come to the United States While they do not generally view themselves as part of a missionary movement  some immigrate because of the political situation in their homeland some acknowledge that economic benefits play a part some have come in response to the shortage in the church On Long Island according to the National Catholic Directory there are fewer priests for the large number of parishioners than in any other diocese in the nation There are 13 million Roman Catholics in the diocese which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties Of the 575 Americanborn priests serving the Islands 129 parishes 494 are incardinated Out of this number in 1984 48 priests retired Four left for health reasons Several deaths occurred  no exact number was available  and 17 priests were released by the diocese to go into special work Many of the foreignborn priests such as Fathers Pascual and Soriano have become naturalized citizens The Rev Bonaventure Thekkeveetil who came to Long Island in 1965 from India said he planned to apply for citizenship shortly Although he originally had no plans to remain permanently he said he has become emotionally attached to America and its culture It is not so different here he said Catholic priests have the same theology and the same Pope Other priests however said that adjustment to the Western world has not been so easy In their free time they say they tend to seek the company of other foreign priests because we have more in common as one priest put it There are many differences between life on Long Island and in their homelands many priests acknowledged For example in India Father Thekkeveetil served in a parish of 35 families The Blessed Sacrament Church in North Valley Stream his new home serves 4000 families He said that in India where it is not easy to convert to Catholicism there appears to be a surplus of Roman Catholic priests While Father Thekkeveetil said that parishioners in his country where many live at subsistence levels would not let a priest want for food he noted that priests are poorly paid and must use public transportation In the Rockville Centre Diocese each priest has a car Father Soriano said that in many Philippine villages motorcycles are used by priests for cheap transportation Not all parishes have electricity running water or telephones he said For Father Thekkeveetil who came to Blessed Sacrament two months ago the pace of work is full of constants He takes turns with two other associate priests at three daily morning masses not including funeral masses and at an evening mass twice a week He teaches adult Bible studies and religion classes twice weekly at the churchs elementary school coaches wouldbe converts presides over preCana marriage preparation instruction and makes hospital calls on a 24hour basis In addition to bringing in foreign priests the Rockville Centre Diocese like other American dioceses is adapting to the shortage of priests in a variety of ways One approach to the problem that has been called successful is the diaconate program which came about as the result of the Second Vatican Councils decision to restore the order of permanent deacons Today there 133 deacons in the diocese with 54 preparing for ordination Nationwide in 1984 there were 7102 permanent deacons After a fouryear program in theology morality scripture dogma and public speaking a deacon who must be at least 35 may perform marriages baptize preside over wakes and funerals and preach He cannot say mass or hear confession Under the regulations a man may be married but if a spouse should die he cannot marry again If he is single at ordination he must agree to live a celibate life Women cannot be deacons in the Roman Catholic Church The Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Lloyd Harbor where most priests from the area are trained plays an important role in the dioceses plans to combat future shortages Diocese statistics show that while the number of seminary students is down from the 1970s there has been a slight increase in recent years The shortage of priests varies across the country But William Byrne of Westbury director of the dioceses permanent diaconate program said that given the unusually large number of Catholics on Long Island it is particularly acute According to Mr Byrne fewer men are entering the priesthood because modern society whose general philosophy centers around meism does not encourage people to enter a life that is its reverse Father Lisante agreed The priesthood he said with its primary value of selflessness over selfishness must look out of step to many young people who appear to be motivated by two values  money and sex Obviously he went on if a priest is doing his job he shouldnt have too much money Obviously sex is out
IDEAS & TRENDS;   An Understanding On Salvation,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/weekinreview/ideas-trends-an-understanding-on-salvation.html,Is faith alone enough to attain salvation Or does it also depend as Roman Catholics assert upon a believers good works A disagreement on that sensitive issue of Christian faith has divided Protestants and Catholics since the Reformation in the 16th century Last week theologians of the Anglican Church a Protestant denomination with 63 million members around the world were close to agreement with Catholics on the question A commission of 24 theologians from both churches meeting at a Franciscan monastery in Garrison NY said they had discovered that their beliefs were not so far apart as they had thought An accord commission members said would recognize that salvation depends upon faith and the grace of God but that its attainment is helped by personal conduct Despite this steppingstone Anglicans and Catholics acknowledge that it will be a long time before each can recognize the validity of the others church Many critical issues such as the ordination of women abortion and the extent of papal power still stand in the way The Anglican Church which includes 3 million Episcopalians in the United States was created 450 years ago when Henry VIII defied a papal ban on his marriage and founded a new state church
TINY LIECHTENSTEIN BASKS IN POPE'S BIG SPOTLIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/09/world/tiny-liechtenstein-basks-in-pope-s-big-spotlight.html,This tiny Alpine country which thrives on anonymity and has reason to believe that small is beautiful briefly loomed large today because of a visit by Pope John Paul II For nearly 10 hours the Pope made his way across the countrys green valleys and spoke in the shadow of craggy mountainsides He watched parades of Liechtensteiners in traditional costumes and visited the Vaduz castle which still dominates this city  there are no skyscrapers  and received the devout homage of the royal family He visited a monastery where for 300 years the faithful could receive a plenary indulgence a kind of guarantee of safe passage to heaven by praying on their knees on a Saturday as the bells rang Crowds Outnumber Residents As for the crowds they were larger than the population of the country This was not difficult since this country has just 26680 residents making it about the size of Lindenhurst LI or Ponca City Okla Still from a tiny country the Pope had a large message for the world This Pope who has repeatedly attacked abortion issued some of his strongest words ever on the subject The unborn human beings right to live is one of the inalienable human rights the Pope told the officials of this country Abortion a Repulsive Crime Citing the Vatican Councils teaching the Pope said abortion and taking the childs life are repulsive crimes Earlier in his Angelus prayer after a mass near the town of Eschen the Pope asked a crowd of 30000 to save the unborn human from the threat of the born man who usurps the right to destroy and kill the child in the mothers womb In his sermon at the mass likely to be heard by Catholic politicians elsewhere he scolded Christians who were ashamed to stand up for those moral fundamentals associated with the Roman Catholic faith For his stern message the Pope chose the gentlest of countries a land that has made its size  its 61 square miles make it smaller than the District of Columbia  a source of pride and a lucrative business Government officials who were asked about the number of unemployed here gave different figures with their estimates ranging from 6 people to about 40 out of a work force of 16500 Catholic Head of State Human dimensions are unimportant to God also to those who serve him declared the head of state Prince Franz Josef II 79 years old in a warm address of welcome to John Paul The Prince a Roman Catholic has effectively handed over the daytoday running of the country to his son The Pope does not mind the size of a country said Bishop Johannes Vonderach the Bishop of Chur A resolution welcoming John Paul passed by the Liechtenstein Diet the countrys 15member Parliament proudly referred to the land as the minor country in Europe The resolution expressed a policy of peace based on Christian principles all of which meant that Liechtenstein feels bound in a special way with the Holy See The Pope too turned smallness into a Christian virtue Final Word From Pope Due to the natural circumstances in which you live the Pope said this evening on departing you have a particular instinct for that which is small and in need of protection Guard for yourself the virtues of modesty and magnanimity After World War II Liechtenstein was so poor that the royal family sold some of its jewels to keep the Government from bankruptcy Now it is one of the worlds richest countries per capita largely because of thousands of letter box companies that register here to avoid paying higher taxes elsewhere Liechtenstein also sells huge amounts of postage stamps  commemorative issues in honor of the Pope were being hawked on the streets today  and has developed a significant industial base including a big false teeth business Significant Tourist Industry Its blessed geographic position snuggled between Austria and Switzerland at the top of the Rhine Valley and on the edge of the Alps has given it a respectable tourist industry The Pope also gave this rolling green land a plug declaring it a beautiful and friendly country I think of the magnificent scenery he said with the majestic mountains and the so carefully tilled meadows and fields of the manifold churches and chapels paths and mountain crosses Liechtensteins smallness and its ability to stay out of European conflicts have allowed the country to preserve traditions some good some bad that withered elsewhere long ago It is one of the few nations whose name is the same as that of its royal family Women Slow to Get the Vote Women got the right to vote in national elections only last year and one area Mauren held out until last week when it finally approved womens suffrage in local elections The strength of tradition also applies to Catholicism which is the state religion Pope Pius XII was the godfather of the hereditary Prince Hans Adam Franz Josefs son The country is 85 percent Catholic and an official press release grudgingly admitted barely 10 percent Protestant But even Liechtenstein has felt the tremors of modernity and secularism And here as elsewhere in Europe young Catholics raise dissonant voices All those who are in dialogue with the young are continually confronted with questions that penetratingly show the discrepancy between the Christian message and ecclesiastical reality The Rev Othmar Kahli told the Pope at a joyous celebration for young people held in a broad green field spread before a Baroque 18thcentury chapel A Cause for Joy Father Kahli sounding the closest thing to a dissident voice heard all day declared it a cause for joy when we experience in our church a mood of change and frankness for the needs and questions of our time The opposite is achieved he went on when within the church a fear of confronting new questions and despondency spreads The Pope himself warned Liechtensteiners that wealth often went led to apostasy But added that their high living standards did honor to the ability of the citizens of this country Good fortune in this world John Paul continued only too easily leads to indolence to satisfying egoistic desires and to a manner of thought and behavior which are not compatible with the demands of the Christian ethos In an address to the Pope the 40yearold hereditary Prince made clear that he too sees that the times are changing and he appeared none too happy about it Traditions and authorities which up until now have been the mainstay of human society the Prince declared are becoming increasingly jeopardized or are disappearing Still it is unlikely that Hans Adam is much worried about his own future In this small corner of the world at least the monarchy seems safe and papal authority secure And absolutely no one has territorial ambitions
SENATE REJECTS BILL ON SCHOOL PRAYER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/11/us/senate-rejects-bill-on-school-prayer.html,After a brief debate the Senate today voted overwhelmingly to kill a bill designed to prevent Federal court challenges to organized prayer in the public schools The bill sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina was killed by a vote of 62 to 36 Lawmakers vowed to bring the issue up again but not before next year I did the best I could Mr Helms said I lost Thats not a novelty for me The bill would have barred the Federal courts from hearing cases on the school prayer issue It would not have specifically overturned a series of Supreme Court rulings prohibiting organized prayer in the schools But it would have stopped the courts in the future from outlawing specific prayer laws enacted by local school boards Defeat for Conservatives Todays vote continued a long line of defeats suffered by Senate conservatives on social issues including proposals to prohibit abortion and to restrict the use of busing to integrate the public schools President Reagan has endorsed many of the conservative proposals but none of the major ones have become law in his presidency Mr Helms said the real purpose behind his proposal was not to pass legislation but to create a political issue that could be used against lawmakers in the next election I thought it was essential that we provide the people of the United States with a record vote on how the Senators stand Mr Helms said That was my purpose Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr the Connecticut Republican who led the opposition to the prayer measure said that opposition was building against efforts by Mr Helms and some fundamentalist Christian ministers to link religion more closely to public life The more they try to bring the Government into religion the more people object to it Mr Weicker said The lawmaker noted that 54 Senators supported Mr Helms at one point in a long battle in 1982 over the school prayer issue The vote today he added demonstrates that supporters of the legislation have reached their high water mark of support in the Senate and are now losing votes Hes Not Going to Win Speaking of Mr Helms Mr Weicker said Hes just not going to win on this issue Mr Weicker said the periodic debates over school prayer and other issues have educated people about the First Amendment which mandates freedom of religion They understand whats at issue he said They didnt two years ago Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the majority leader agreed to bring up the bill as part of a deal made earlier this year with Senator Helms who wanted to introduce his measure as an amendment to legislation on spending limits and programs for the Small Business Administration After an impasse developed Mr Helms agreed to free the smallbusiness bill in exchange for a separate vote on the school prayer issue With the outcome of todays vote a foregone conclusion the debate was short and desultory Mr Helms told colleagues Weve got to decide in this country whether we want freedom of religion or freedom from religion Senator Barry Goldwater the Arizona Republican who was once known as Mr Conservative denounced the proposal as an unwarranted intrusion by Government into private lives Mr Goldwater said Senator Helms should be ashamed of his proposal Did you really write that bill the Arizonan asked Mr Helms Mr Helms replied that he was not ashamed of his bill
Is This Censorship Or Obeying the Law?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/12/opinion/l-is-this-censorship-or-obeying-the-law-257796.html,To the Editor The attack by Barbara Parker education policy director of People for the American Way on censors in public schools Stop the Censors OpEd Aug 29 is a puzzling mixture of reason and unreason No doubt much of the indignation over literature in the public schools is from a sophisticated intellectual point of view absurd On the other hand educators who dictate to immature captive audiences with no regard to the rights of parents should not be lauded as defenders of the freedom of children and exponents of the American way Miss Parker comes close to the crux of the controversy when she quotes the superintendent who forbade classroom discussion about homosexuality and abortion and severely restricted discussion of other sensitive topics Evidently Miss Parker thinks that the superintendent was at fault Yet consider for a person with religious convictions these matters cannot be separated from religion But the Supreme Court has prohibited religious doctrine in public schools Ergo these topics must be excluded from the classroom The American way ought surely to be sensitive to religious freedom and to the separation of church and state I suggest that People for the American Way will best serve the American tradition of religious freedom by demanding that all schools provide released time during which religious or antireligious leaders can meet with young members of their flocks to discuss those controversial matters that have religious implications RAYMOND ENGLISH Washington Aug 29 1985 The writer is senior vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center

CHANGE PARTNERS AND DANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/15/books/change-partners-and-dance.html,CARACOLE By Edmund White 342 pp New York E P Dutton 1795 TO go about in a mask is both to conceal and to insist upon ones own identity The concealment is obvious the insistence arises from the masquers challenge to the rest of the world to see through the mask by intuiting or analyzing subtle clues Sometimes especially among the clever or decadent this can be a tricky business At the climactic masked ball scene in Edmund Whites new novel for example theres a throwaway line about revelers dressed as dukes and duchesses who probably were dukes and duchesses Caracole presents itself as a grand fantasy  an oddly distancing and at the same time intensely intimate form of fiction as Mr White well knows Shrewdness and selfawareness ooze from every intricate sentence every linguistic arabesque and hothouse epigram Reading this novel one gets the not altogether delightful feeling of being subjected to a barrage of apercus from a hightoned Henny Youngman Some are pretty good  When he went to the country to commune with his soul his soul stayed in the city  and some of them a bit labored and less successful  He seemed suspiciously alive to the humor value of a perversion one rather thought the adept himself at least would take seriously The framework on which this literary peau de soie is more or less negligently draped is a series of sexual encounters in an unnamed capital city where crude but powerful conquerors exploit dandified metropolitans and rather primitive natives who are so strenuously chthonic as to make a Jungian either blush or giggle which is very probably the point This is a kind of Brazilian Venice  there are canals and palaces  and the city is threatened by jungles rulers from outside as well as its own decadent extravagance within Mr Whites writhing vines of prose are reminiscent of Norman Douglas and of Ronald Firbank and suggest both kinds of lush oppressiveness His characters are colored pebbles in an erotic kaleidoscope he twists gleefully to make Mateo Angelica Gabriel Edwige Mathilda Daniel and a host of unnamed others conjoin and drift apart in quick succession But always males with females as in Noahs own pairings For a writer who has given us A Boys Own Story which was at least ostensibly a novel about growing up homosexual The Joy of Gay Sex and States of Desire Travels in Gay America there is something a little odd about the unvaried heterosexuality of this imaginary crew of nymphs and satyrs It is possible that like Mateo Mr White has come to see love as ludic not agonistic an atypically clumsy formulation that amounts only to the assertion that love is a game and funny In that case the frequently graphic and sometimes gross presentation of these energetic couplings is quite possibly intended to be funny And the grosser the funnier Well it works sometimes more often than one might expect One result of the artificed quality of the book is the distance at which it puts its characters who are like all Theocritean pastoral figures vivid and cute as if seen from the wrong end of a telescope They can endure pleasure and pain that would be intolerable if they were more plausible and persuasive Still a gang rape of a 14yearold and her subsequent abortion both played fundamentally for humor overleap acceptability even on the gimcrack puppet stage behind which Mr White lurks dangling strings of syntax were by no means supposed to ignore But Mr White probably knows that too At least he is brazen about putting into his creatures mouths and minds comments that apply to the book they inhabit There are two sorts of irony the cheap kind that disowns experience and the expensive kind that acknowledges it Or elsewhere The poorest pumpkin truth might become a carriage that could transport him    The trick he saw was to present the most shameful secret as though it were one everyone shared He resolved to step out boldly into the light carrying it his shame in his arms holding it up showing it The book has that defiance throughout daring always to cross any line a reasonable person might draw just for the fun of it for sheer campy delight Young writers are often told by their elders and mentors that the sentence they love most is almost always the one that should be cut And there is most of the time a disciplined truth in that dictum Mr White has written a whole book of those lovable cuttable sentences And this is where the verdict ought to come But verdicts are for morals and ethics This book is provokingly a challenge to taste which is likely to vary from one reader to another or even from moment to moment in the same reader I used to delight in reading Ronald Firbank aloud to certain social realist friends of mine upon whom the effect was like fingernails on a blackboard Caracole is likely to push a fair number of people over the edge too especially at this hefty length But high and dry and laughing at these people for their limitations  the very same limitations that the despised conquerors exhibit in the fantastic city herein depicted  Mr White reigns and deigns impishly looking down and loving the kind of delicious outrage he has worked so hard for in this book and has so richly earned

The Attack on Alaska's Parks,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/16/opinion/the-attack-on-alaska-s-parks.html,If you think that the astonishing wildlife and scenic resources of Alaska that were added to the national park system by Congress in 1980 are safely protected for all time as they are supposed to be you are wrong Alaskas 100 million acres of parks and preserves  a major achievement of the Carter Administration are under attack before they have even been fairly established The assault comes mainly from real estate promoters mining operators biggame guides and hunters  all abetted by the crudely prodevelopment stance of the Reagan Administration and particularly of Alaskas two Senators Stevens and Murkowski Inside the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve for example a rural Levittown is in the making where some 250 building lots are now for sale lined up in an almost continuous sixmile strip only a onehour commuter flight from Anchorage as the ads say The purchaser is offered unsurpassed hunting at his very door  which is not surprising because the preserve is notoriously rich in the big game it was established to protect This Lake Clark tract is now owned by a poorly managed and financially shaky native corporation heavily in debt to politically powerful real estate interests who are greedily eyeing the property for further exploitation One hundred miles inside Denali National Park in the shadow of North Americas mightiest mountain Mount McKinley a 360acre tract is up for sale as mining or resort property or both  for 27 million Such a development will have an impact on the parks already disappearing animal life and its stillunique scenic grandeur  more than this resource can stand as Denalis superintendent succinctly points out As part of the evil legacy of former Interior Secretary James G Watt the Reagan Administration will not approve Park Service spending for even the most strategic park acquisitions in Alaska such as at Lake Clark or Denali though the money is readily available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund Mining  especially the surface mining that creates desolate lunar landscapes along the gravelly beds of many of Alaskas fastflowing streams  has long been the greatest single threat to the integrity of Alaskas national parks It still is but some 40 current mining operations have just been closed down temporarily by Federal court order because they were violating environmental regulations that the Park Service itself had failed to enforce No one was happier  privately than Park Service officials to lose this Sierra Club lawsuit because it has given them grounds to demand from a reluctant Administration the funds and personnel necessary to carry out the judicial mandate A decision of the Alaska Supreme Court a few months ago virtually obliterated the distinction between sport and subsistence hunting an issue as emotional in Alaska as abortion is in the Lower 48 Unless this decision is modified by the State Legislature the protected moose and bear and caribou are not going to have a chance against subsistence and sport hunters and nobody in Alaska now can tell you the difference between them Goodbye big game goodbye wilderness goodbye park Even under present rules the Park Service cannot adequately protect the wildlife under its mandate Denali National Park and Preserve has only four rangers on its permanent staff assigned to patrol an area roughly equivalent in size to Massachusetts Glacier Bay has four for an area the size of Connecticut Apart from the impossibility of supervising the legally permitted hunting inside the parks rangers  without even one park plane  are hopelessly unable to cope with the poaching that decimates Alaskas rarest wildlife Last winter at least 12 percent of Denalis meager wolf population was lost to poachers The going price is 200 or more a pelt to satisfy the demands of men and women indecent enough to wear the fur of this persecuted animal Incredibly Alaska is even considering restoration of the bounty on wolves so its sport hunters can collect a few more moose or caribou for themselves Tourism is now Alaskas third largest industry It is also Alaskas only growth industry It is not likely to continue that way with the increasingly destructive exploitation of Alaskas natural attractions  its wildlife its forests its streams its fisheries its silent wilderness With the influx of young people to the state however and the corresponding growth of the conservation movement here there may yet be hope that both state and national administrations will get the message before it is too late

WASHINGTON;   REAGAN AND THE COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/18/opinion/washington-reagan-and-the-courts.html,Like all members of the human race members of the Supreme Court of the United States have birthdays This is usually noted around here at the opening of the Courts autumn term especially this week on the 198th birthday of the Constitution when Chief Justice Warren Burger of Minnesota and Associate Justice Lewis F Powell of Virginia both turn 78 Its not quite clear how the Chief Justice arranged to be born on the anniversary of the signing of the Constitution but the coincidence has given him a special and useful interest in the document And while a few years ago he liked to talk vaguely about mandatory retirement for members of the Court at age 75 it would be surprising if he didnt want to say a few words from the bench on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution in 1987 The other members seem in no hurry to get out either Though on average the present members of the Court are older than the Nine Old Men President Franklin D Roosevelt tried and failed to get rid of they are holding on as usual The Supreme Court has not become the conservative bastion the Democratic leaders feared when Ronald Reagan was elected and reelected He has been able to appoint only one member the conservative Sandra Day OConnor to replace the liberal Potter Stewart And with the tendency of Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun to vote more often than expected with the liberal wing the balance today is not all that different In the lower Federal courts however there are many changes Since he entered the White House in 1981 Mr Reagan has appointed more than 200 district and appeals court judges most of them carefully chosen to respect his conservative philosophy By the end of his second term noted The Wall Street Journal he will probably have named more than half the 743 Federal judges in the country That says [Fred] Fielding [who monitors judicial appointments in the White House]  is a legacy that will last long beyond his Administration  Justice Department officials concede not only that they take care to inquire into a prospective candidates background and judicial philosophy before recommending nomination but that this practice will probably be followed more carefully under Attorney General Ed Meese They are particularly interested in how a candidate approaches questions of abortion affirmative action and First Amendment rights and insist that these are merely established procedures Former Carter Administration officials concede that while they often discussed such concerns before appointing judges they never did so to the extent now practiced by the Reagan White House and Justice Department One of the various private conservative organizations that are active in screening judicial applicants is the Center for Judicial Studies headed by James McClellan former aide to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina The center is said to have the cooperation and financial support of the Moral Majority Foundation and other rightwing groups interested in perpetuating their conservative agenda through the courts Liberals meanwhile are establishing their own organizations to combat the efforts of rightwing factions and seeking funds through prominent national publications to do so One of these is People for the American Way founded by the television producer Norman Lear and based in Washington Sheldon Goldman a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst has published a study of the firstterm judicial appointments of Mr Reagan and concluded that 98 percent of them are Republican 93 percent white 92 percent men and over 20 percent of them millionaires At the same time the American Bar Association which has evaluated judicial appointments for many years rated more than half of Mr Reagans appointees as exceptionally well qualified or well qualified Nevertheless while nobody not even the President or Attorney General Meese can foresee how their judicial appointments will vote in the future  any more than FDR could the fact remains that a most intense campaign is now being waged to assure that as Mr Reagans power slips in his second term he will leave behind a Federal judiciary he hopes will be faithful to his views
Political Memo;   Slouching Toward the Center (Post-Reagan),https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/18/us/political-memo-slouching-toward-the-center-post-reagan.html,Nothing is forever in politics not even the political alignments wrought by the alchemy of President Reagan Less than a year after Mr Reagans landslide victory plunged Democrats into despair and sent Republican spirits soaring both major political parties have begun to look toward the postReagan era With Mr Reagans dominance of the political scene approaching an end and the conservative agenda seemingly stalled both parties appear to be groping their way toward the political center on the assumption that this will be the crucial ground on which the campaign battles of 1986 and beyond will be waged The Democratic left and the Republican right of course are not particularly happy with this movement and both can be expected to try to reverse it in the 1988 Presidential election The Republican right is especially frustrated these days which may explain why some of its leaders recently lashed out at one of their own Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York a Reagan loyalist and a probable Republican Presidential contender for voting in favor of imposing mild sanctions against the Government of South Africa Democrats Chart New Policy The Democrats devastated by their 1984 losses have been rather open about their efforts to find the political middle ground They formed a commission to chart new policy directions and have taken a number of other steps symbolic and substantive to try to position the party closer to the concerns of middleclass and younger voters even at the risk of alienating blacks and other traditional Democratic constituencies Republicans who have been on a political high since last Novembers elections were slower to recognize the need to reposition themselves but they are now beginning to move Congressional Republicans concerned that the White House was neglecting or mishandling many of the issues that are likely to be at the center of the 1986 elections have been in open conflict with President Reagan on a wide range of domestic and foreign policy questions Pressure from Capitol Hill much of it from Republicans has forced Mr Reagan to reassess and in some cases modify his position on military spending South Africa trade policy and a number of other issues And as Mr Reagan presses for enactment of his proposal to overhaul the tax system he faces perhaps his most difficult dealings not with the Democratic majority in the House but with the Republican majority in the Senate It is not that unusual for the Congressional wing of a party to assert its independence from a President before a midterm election and in this case Mr Reagans 1984 reelection campaign practically invited such a political fracture In that contest Mr Reagan created a feeling of rebirth in the nation a morning in America mood and made little effort to outline a secondterm agenda or offer a vision for the future Another factor some strategists say is that as the Republican Party has broadened its base under Mr Reagans leadership leaders have recognized the need to expand the partys agenda to accommodate its new political diversity This kind of talk does not sit well with party conservatives who want to keep the focus on abortion school prayer and other issues that some party moderates fear could alienate younger voters Largely because of the differences between Congressional Republicans and the White House Democrats are less worried now than they were before about having to run against a clearly focused Reagan agenda in 1986 a prospect that some had feared carried the risk of entangling Democratic candidates with Mr Reagans strong personal popularity We have a popular Republican President with a watereddown Democratic agenda said Christopher Matthews an aide to the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr referring to Mr Reagans policy concessions this year But some political strategists are beginning to wonder if either partys current agenda is going to be relevant to the political debate expected to take place in the postReagan era At the Democratic National Committee Paul G Kirk Jr the national chairman and his strategists have been assessing the results of a series of focus group sessions conducted for the party by Philip Kotler of Northwestern University The focus sessions which brought together groups of citizens and engaged them in intensive political discussions are part of the partys effort to find ways to expand its list of donors and communicate with voters who have been drifting away from the party From these sessions and other polling data Democrats are convinced that the new political debate will center on what one party official calls familyrelated economic security issues  such things as buying a house education and job security and on the role Government should play in peoples lives Mr Reagans firstterm budget assault on Federal social programs helped set up that debate but both Republican and Democratic analysts say it has only begun Of Reagans Last Years To what extent Mr Reagan will use his remaining years in the White House to shape that debate remains to be seen and Democrats say they do not underestimate his ability to do so But they also say their polling and focus group results indicate that many people are less concerned about Mr Reagans last years of governance than they are about the leadership that succeeds him In most cases a party cannot really define itself until it elects a President Mr Reagans Presidency for example restored public confidence in his partys ability to manage the economy and brought about a watershed in the Republican struggle to broaden the partys base among many traditional Democratic voters That is no small legacy that he leaves for Republicans to build on It will be morning in America as long as Reagan is President and the economy is purring along said one Democratic strategist But when people look to the future they dont even know what day it is much less the hour
HIGH COURT BARS U.S. ROLE IN 2 CASES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/us/high-court-bars-us-role-in-2-cases.html,The Supreme Court refused today to allow the Justice Department to make oral arguments as a friend of the court in two of the major cases of the coming term One case involves abortion the other affirmative action on jobs The Courts action recorded in brief unsigned orders was neither unusual nor surprising department officials said because the parties in both cases refused to yield any of their own argument time The Court often authorizes the Justice Department to make arguments as a friend of the court when a party in a case agrees to share its time But it rarely deviates from its practice of confining arguments to one hour per case divided evenly between the opposing sides experts on the Court said Todays action was no big deal said Acting Solicitor General Charles Fried who filed the Departments motions seeking permission to participate in the oral arguments He said he felt it was worth making the requests although he said he had not expected the motions to be granted Indication of Reagan Policy The Court granted the Justice Department permission today to participate in arguing several cases in which the parties the Department supports had agreed to share their time The Justice Departments request for extra argument time had been seen by some experts as an indication of the Reagan Administrations aggressive efforts to advocate before the Court its positions against abortion and affirmative action programs that include preferences for members of minority groups In the abortion case in which the Court agreed to review lower court decisions striking down Pennsylvania and Illinois laws that regulate abortion Mr Fried filed a brief in July urging the Court to overrule its 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion Department officials acknowledged that the Court is unlikely to overturn the 1973 ruling In the affirmative action case involving a challenge by white schoolteachers in Jackson Mich to a plan giving blacks preferences in layoffs Mr Fried argued broadly that all governmental preferences based on race are unconstitutional The abortion case is to be argued Nov 5 the case involving racial preferences in teacher layoffs Nov 6
BRIEFING;   Gender Tenders,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/us/briefing-gender-tenders.html,The term gender gap died in last years Presidential election and the White House and its helpers at the Republican National Committee are working to make sure there is no renaissance The term was supposed to indicate a significant lack of support among women that could be exploited to defeat President Reagan In the election Mr Reagan received 57 percent of the female vote a gain of 10 points over 1980 And the Republican Party is now accelerating its effort to polish its image among women Yesterday two leaders of the national committee Frank J Fahrenkopf Jr and Betty Heitman joined a top White House political aide Edward J Rollins in announcing the establishment of Alliance for Opportunity a program to help women turn the challenges of their personal and professional lives into opportunities The program will start with a conference in Orlando next month President Reagan believes women of the 1980s are a diverse majority with varied interests and varied futures Mr Rollins said Meantime the National Federation of American Women is preparing to convene Friday and Saturday in Phoenix Principal speakers at the convention are to be Vice President Bush and Jeane J Kirkpatrick the former chief delegate to the United Nations Mr Bush is considered a sure contender for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination Mrs Kirkpatrick has been mentioned as a possible VicePresidential candidate There is also movement on the Democratic side Representative Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio said she was starting a political action commitee to support women and possibly a few men seeking election to state and local offices as well as to Congress Miss Oakar said the committee still without a title would be different in several ways To win its support candidates must favor legislation to give women equity in such areas as pay pensions and insurance Their position on social issues such as abortion will not be the determining factor in whether they get money Miss Oakar said her committee would not be competing for funds with other committees and groups that support women running as Democratic candidates
"BISHOPS BEGIN PLANNING FOR VISIT BY POPE, EXPECTED IN 1987",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/us/bishops-begin-planning-for-visit-by-pope-expected-in-1987.html,Planning has begun for an expected weeklong visit by Pope John Paul II to the United States in the fall of 1987 officials of the National Conference of Catholics Bishops disclosed yesterday Reports earlier this week suggested such a trip was only a possibility but officials at the bishops conference the United States Catholic Churchs policymaking body said yesterday that preliminary prepartions were already under way Sources at the bishops conference attributed the speculative tone used earlier to the Vaticans hesitancy about committing the Pope to a specific sechedule We feel pretty certain its going to happen said William Ryan a spokesman for the bishops conference We wouldnt be going through this otherwise The Pope is expected to spend about a week in September or October 1987 visiting several cities in the South and West Mr Ryan said The cities have not been chosen The Administrative Committee the board of directors of the bishops conference will recommend an itinerary to the Popes staff The committee will make key decisions on the Popes trip but much of the groundwork will be done by a smaller committee of bishops and by Father Robert N Lynch associate general secretary who helped coordinate the Popes first trip to the United States from Oct 17 1979 On that trip the Pope visited Boston New York Philadelphia Des Moines Chicago and Washington I suppose because hes visited the cities of the East the logical thing for him to do would be to visit a different part of the country Mr Ryan said Officials have not yet decided where the Pope will land in the United States or whether New York might be included on a visit A spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York said the archdiocese had not yet been informed that the Pope would visit the United States Disagreement in Church Announcement of the visit comes after years of considerable strain between the Vatican and the Catholic Church in the United States The Pope has lectured American bishops visiting Rome about the need to clearly expound the churchs opposition to artificial birth control abortion remarriage after divorce and premarital sexual relations He has also discouraged advocacy of the ordination of women to the priesthood Many American Catholics and some of their leaders disagree with the Popes views on these issues and the Vatican has taken a number of steps that have been interpreted as an effort to reassert church discipline The Vatican has ordered studies of Catholic seminaries and religious orders in the United States to determine the soundness of their teachings and practices However Msgr Daniel F Hoye general secretary of the bishops conference denied that these issues were motivations for the Popes trip This is a continuation of his pastoral visits all around the world Monsignor Hoye said The purpose is to present his message to different sections of his flock and also to give the local church the opportunity to give its richness and wisdom directly to the Holy Father Monsignor Hoye said the Pope indicated at the time of his 1979 visit that he wanted to return to the United States where there are 50 million Catholics Bishop James W Malone of Youngstown Ohio president of the bishops conference visited the Pope in June and the question of another trip to the United States was discussed He surmised from that conversation that the Pope would be coming Mr Ryan said In a statement replying to the announcement of the Popes visit Bishop Malone said I am deeply grateful that the Holy Father has expressed a desire to return to our country We look forward to receiving him again with joy and affection Since his election as Pope on Oct 16 1978 John Paul II has made 28 trips outside of Italy visiting more than 50 countries in Europe North America and Asia Technically the Pope has made three visits to the Unites States but two of those were stops in Alaska in 1981 and 1984 as part of trips to Asia The Pope last traveled to the Western Hemisphere earlier this year when he visited Venezuela Equador Peru and Trinidad and Tobago on a visit that lasted from Jan 26 to Feb 6 He Streesed Help for the Poor On his 1979 visit the Pope celebrated outdoor masses in each major city he visited and addressed crowds at Yankee and Shea Stadiums and at Madison Square Garden Stressing the theme that the needs of the poor must be served he visited a housing project in the South Bronx and St Charles Borromeo Church in Harlem At the United Nations he called on the worlds countries to sustain the human rights of all people and he warned against the arms race The trip reaffirmed the Popes appeal as tens of thousands of people were at every event But there were also one or two moments of discomfort for the Vatican particularly at a speech by the Pope at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington when nuns stood up to protest the absence of women priests in the church

STAGE VIEW;   PLAYWRIGHTS REDISCOVER THE USES OF POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/arts/stage-view-playwrights-rediscover-the-uses-of-politics.html,In the lineup of possible productions for the new theater season there are at least eight plays that address political questions five of them are written by Americans and half are scheduled for Broadway houses How much comfort this development will give people who complain that the theater needs more political themes is uncertain The political spectrum of these plays is not very wide and a couple of them  Howard Fasts Citizen Tom Paine and William Luces Lillian based on Lillian Hellmans three autobiographical books  could not possibly avoid being political given their subjects But the list this year suggests the theater may be turning to politics for its themes more than it has in many seasons even if the stories being told are familiar or predictable  such as Emily Manns treatment of the murder of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and the homosexual city Supervisor Harvey Milk in Execution of Justice James Ryans story of the murder of Congressman Allard Lowenstein in Dennis or John Pielmeiers look at Vietnam veterans in The Boys of Winter Miss Mann and Mr Ryan have seized on crimes and trials involving not only public officials but clearcut ideological conflicts and troubling questions about tolerance and what is tolerable in times of political and sexual revolution and possibly counterrevolution And in a time when the popular image of the Vietnam veteran is a mixture of televisions Magnum and Hollywoods Rambo there is an urgent need for the kind of thoughtful interpretation the theater can give In addition to the American dramas there will be a play by Athol Fugard about apartheid in South Africa and two British works  Stephen MacDonalds Not About Heroes mirroring in the lives and work of the war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen the collapse of the old imperial social order during World War I and David Hares Map of the World a theme of which is the poverty of most of the world and the wealth of a little of it One might even argue that the Royal Shakespeare Companys Poppy an irreverent musical look back at the time when Great Britain controlled the opium trade is a political play rather than a satire on the historical pretensions of empire That kind of roster hardly heralds a return to some seasons of the 1930s or the early 50s when the theater took up political issues seriously or ridiculed politicians hilariously with asssurance and authority But it is more than we have been given in recent years except in very small Off Off Broadway houses There is a tendency to think there were more political themes on the stage during the Vietnam war and the social protests of the late 60s but that is illusory That kind of theater was mostly in the streets and then as in recent years except for a few conscienceprobing works about racial injustice the most biting political plays were imported The fashion is to abuse Hollywood for being superficial or juvenile but in recent years films have dealt with serious political questions more often and more effectively on the whole than the theater has  and the willingness to confront such issues is a sign of maturity The 60s did leave us with a notion that in the theater politics ought to be as strident as it is in the street A writer as usually graceful and witty as Gore Vidal turned intolerably heavy in An Evening With Richard Nixon And    in the early 70s and Larry Kramers Normal Heart which continues at the Public Theater does not invite one into a discussion of an agonizing issue it assaults and pummels the audience with a great puritanical sermon parceled out among a dozen or so voices American playwrights used to be as sophisticated as any in these matters Arthur Miller did not rattle on about McCarthyism in The Crucible but people understood In the past it was even possible to make some telling points about politics and the shenanigans of politicians in musicals If Of Thee I Sing exposed the shallowness of all of them a few aimed at particular targets and hit them  as George S Kaufman Moss Hart Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart did in Id Rather Be Right which still left people feeling affectionate about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the beginning of his second term but with the kind of affection one has for somone who has been rudely diminished Even Kaufmans staging of John Steinbecks novel Of Mice and Men has a worldly sophistication that makes one want to understand the political ideas it deals with There is a lot to be said for worldliness One does not need the drama of a Presidents resignation in 1974 or the tumultuous upheavals in the streets in 1968 to inspire good theater There is no lack of issues or of targets today material for everything from tragedy to satire Some of the material seems irresistible  Government agents trapping politicians in Abscam and all the imitative scams following Representatives and Senators going to jail Federal judges standing trial governors with girlfriends in the fast lane The people on Capitol Hill or in the cabinet now are hardly less amusing than those in the 30s and President Reagan and his entourage can rival the Roosevelts themselves as subjects of interest The opportunity for playwrights would seem especially ripe now when some media managers and even columnists seem to be making heroic suspensions of disbelief about politicians and their motives And some of the current issues cry out for dramatization  the first open conflict of basic political ideologies seen in decades the arms race Dr Strangelove was a good word but was it the last the abortion debate Lebanon Pakistan the invasion of Grenada the turmoil in Central America the spy game in industry as well as Government the growth and operations of international business empires Other than during the Civil War or World War II it would be hard to think of a time when there are so many political issues that can be readily grasped by everyone in an audience and that allow such scope for disagreement or for dramatic treatment The dramatic imagination of most recent American playwrights appears not to penetrate political philosophy or history at all and to have become not only exclusively personal but in many cases private That is an odd situation for theater The best playwrights in the most vibrant ages have all been involved in the political debates of their times from Aeschylus and Sophocles to Shakespeare to Racine and Moliere to Shaw And in recent years it is hard to imagine any nation in which one could go to so many plays as one can here without meeting some discussion of political issues  certainly not Italy Germany France or most Latin American nations It has been possible in the 70s and 80s to get the impression that there has been a loss of political conscience or even awareness in the American theater and the danger of that perception is that theater could be seen to be moving to the periphery of life So while the evidence of renewed political interest in the current season may be more glimmer than beacon it is a welcome sign If that interest continues we might even find we all have more to say to one another about the life we share than politicians have led us to believe In the end that kind of result is what theater is about
THE PREGNANT DETECTIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/the-pregnant-detective.html,IN A LARGE stately home in a quiet oldmoney Los Angeles neighborhood the television producer Barney Rosenzweig got ready for work A particularly adept practitioner of West Coast sartorial style he picked an outfit that could best be described as authoritatively casual handsome crewneck sweater pale shirt underneath khaki slacks and pastel argyle socks slipped into soft leather loafers Downstairs the swinging door that led from kitchen to dining room swooshed back and forth as breakfast was set forth on a large wooden table  decorative baskets lined with cloth napkins and overflowing with an assortment of rolls jars of jam butter and thermos bottles of coffee with and without caffeine Birds sang in the trees outside late spring sunlight brightened the pale yellow walls and bounced off the fat flowered upholstery if a script had called for a setting that exuded calm this was it And just like a set in a script it was a perfectly contrived illusion Rosenzweig the executive producer of Cagney  Lacey the CBS television series about two women detectives in the New York City Police Department was about to preside over an emergency staff meeting on a morning when staff members should have been embarking on a threemonth hiatus They were there to discuss the unexpected news that the actress Tyne Daly who plays Detective Lacey and her husband the actordirector Georg Stanford Brown were expecting a baby Daly would be pregnant for most of the production schedule for the series which would resume on Monday Sept 30 Detective Lacey is hardly the first television character to conceive Lucille Balls wacky Lucy and her bandleader husband started a smallscreen family over 30 years ago Last year several reallife pregnancies were reflected in story lines The characters played by Meredith Baxter Birney and Rhea Perlman respectively of the situation comedies Family Ties and Cheers were allowed to conceive although Shelley Longs pregnancy was hidden from the camera because her character on Cheers was a single woman Pregnancy was such a popular topic that the actress Barbara Bosson for example who was not expecting was padded so that the divorced mother she plays on Hill Street Blues could have a child out of wedlock And tortured or troublesome pregnancies have been a staple of soap operas for years But this pregnancy will be different because Cagney  Lacey is an anomaly in network primetime episodic programming  the only dramatic series that features women in the lead roles This baby will be born center stage without the tranquilizing effects of a laugh track Mary Beth Lacey and her partner Christine Cagney played by Sharon Gless are unlikely figures in prime time where most women are younger better looking and single Detective  this season Sergeant  Cagney is single but she is in her late 30s late enough for her unmarried status to be an emotional issue for her rather than a transitional phase She is also an ambitious driven wiseacre who isnt above the kind of flirtatious sexual fling traditionally associated with male characters Detective Lacey much more the earthmother type is an emotional dedicated streettough cop married to a frequently unemployed construction worker and the mother of two boys Not only does the show dare the unusual with two women leads it is an oddity as a cop show too admittedly weak on action and strong on issues stories on breast cancer sexual harassment abandoned children There arent as many car chases as there are scenes in what the shows writers call The Jane the womens restroom where the only two female detectives in the precinct can have a little privacy Until now the rewards for being different have been few In the four embattled years since Cagney  Lacey began as a movie for television the show has been canceled twice only to arise again twice after Rosenzweig mounted massive resuscitation campaigns in the press It has survived low ratings shifting time slots and three actresses in the role of Christine Cagney But this year finally the series is at the right place at the right time CBS has structured its Monday night lineup with women in mind to offer an alternative to ABCs Monday Night Football In its crucial 10 PM time slot Cagney  Lacey  forced by events to tackle the story of how a 38yearold working woman decides when and whether to have a child and how to juggle family and career  could well strengthen CBSs standing by addressing issues that have lately become a national obsession MEMBERS OF THE CAGney  Lacey staff straggled into the meeting heads bowed briefcases bulging The only one who seemed to welcome the challenge was Rosenzweig himself who posed his standard query What are we saying to the women of America To him the pending baby represented a chance to make a social comment It was to be sure also a lever to use with the network to get an early fullseason renewal so that production could begin well before Daly was due to deliver For a man whose career resembled a rollercoaster ride his current comfortable situation contrasted sharply with his predicament in 1976 when in need of a job he spent a season producing Charlies Angels Now the promise of a secure full season and the challenge of creating a primetime pregnancy far outweighed the discomfort of going back to work without a vacation Everyone else present seemed temporarily paralyzed by questions of logistics deadlines and schedules even the hushed surroundings and the civilizing influence of breakfast did not soften the edge of group panic These people might know episodic television they did not know much about babies Rosenzweig is the father of three grown daughters born before todays trend toward later pregnancies and actively involved fathers Steve Brown and Terry Louise Fisher the two writerproducers are both single and childless as is the coproducer P K Knelman and the executive story consultant Patricia Green The executive story editor Georgia Jeffries the mother of two young children was regarded with suspicion because she had been too adamantly happy throughout both pregnancies Barbara Corday cowriter of the original Cagney  Lacey television movie and now Rosenzweigs wife had gone on from writing to blaze a feminist trail through television first as head of comedy series development for ABC Next she formed a production company and then left to join Columbia Pictures Television where she is now the president overseeing development and production of primetime and daytime features Although she no longer had daily dealings with Cagney  Lacey she sat in on this meeting and confirmed her husbands belief in reverse sexism which meant hiring a disproportionate number of women to keep his series on the right track He believes that women have information he did not have  as his wife demonstrated when she gently pointed out that Dalys pregnancy would begin to show before any scripts could be shot There was no time to cower behind a discussion about salvaging existing scripts What Rosenzweig called the arc of the pregnancy where it goes and when it goes would have to be discussed immediately With a collective deep breath they set to work For hours they debated the way a modern working womans late pregnancy should look aware that they had to satisfy three criteria Rosenzweig looked for a mix of social responsibility and entertainment the network hoped more cautiously for entertainment without too much provocation and the two stars insisted on their notions developed over the years of how the characters should act This someone said should be a planned baby because an accident would imply that Lacey was not careful about birth control which was an irresponsible message to send to the women of America But it was pointed out the character had had breast cancer last year in a twopart story that was one of the highestrated shows of Cagney  Lacey Why would Lacey get pregnant after a cancer scare Rosenzweig liked the dramatic implications of such a decision We can infer that this is a grasping at life after a brush with death Some storyline issues were easy Everyone agreed on the reaction from the two Lacey sons Its living proof that your mother has sex its embarrassing the sex of the baby unanimous preference for a girl and the conflicts that would erupt between Lacey and Cagney as the pregnancy progressed Then the real world and Rosenzweigs perceived responsibilities to it intruded Someone said that a woman Mary Beth Laceys age would be likely to have amniocentesis a procedure performed between the 15th and 17th weeks of pregnancy to assure that the fetus does not suffer from certain abnormalities Many women would choose to have an abortion if the test showed that their baby would for example suffer from Downs syndrome which usually results in mental retardation and physical handicaps and is more common among children of older pregnant women The meetings sentiment was decidedly prochoice But the character of Mary Beth Lacey was a doting mother who in one episode proclaimed of an abandoned deaf child Shes perfect She just cant hear This was not a woman who would opt for an abortion at this stage of her life Rosenzweig was not at all pleased at the notion that his show would come out against a womans right to make a choice  that he was going to be boxed into a corner by a character he had helped to create He knew that Daly would share his dismay that her disapproval was a formidable obstacle Youve got to be very careful he muttered Mary Beth wouldnt abort a Downs syndrome baby But then youre saying to women Do not have an abortion  For the moment the best solution was to avoid the issue Mary Beth Lacey would have amniocentesis simply because her doctor insisted on it for all women her age and the tests would show a healthy baby Weeks later as the writers created the details of individual shows they would face the question of Detective Laceys attitude on abortion For now they were spared the awkward choice between loyalty to the character they had created and loyalty to their own consciences C L 2nd I NSERTING SOCIAL issues into an entertaining format is important to Tyne Daly whose pregnancy occasioned Rosenzweigs philosophical seminar An actress who has played everything from classical drama to daytime soap opera Daly seems to have struck a wary peace with network television she does it but very much on her own terms Because she has been with Cagney  Lacey from its beginnings in 1981 her terms are taken quite seriously She often has the last word on what Mary Beth Lacey will or wont do and only weeks into her pregnancy was deeply involved in the process of developing stories and scripts Less demonstrative  but no less strongwilled  than her garrulous gesticulating character and possessed of an elegant classically trained speaking voice that bears no resemblance to Detective Laceys bray Daly is determined to stand out in the primetime crowd If TV is fast food like McDonalds and you have to wrap it up and get it out once a week she says then on this menu of french fries and onion rings and double burgers we would like to be the green salad Youve got to have something on the menu thats nourishing and interesting If its challenging to act then it should be challenging to watch Producer Norman Lear had already introduced previously taboo subjects like bigotry and discrimination to American television with All in the Family in 1971 but he clothed his innovation in a familiar situationcomedy format In 1977 Lou Grant a series about a Los Angeles newspaper was virtually alone in its efforts to mix urban issues with entertainment More recent shows  Cagney  Lacey Hill Street Blues a series about a beleaguered police precinct and St Elsewhere a series about an equally beleaguered urban hospital  have had to fight their way onto the air past the almost apologetic label of quality programming that is slapped on shows that lack punch lines pulchritude or both It is only in the last year that Cagney  Lacey has achieved both social significance and commercial appeal About 207 million people now tune in to it each week About 207 million people now tune in to it each week According to David Poltrack vice president of CBSs research department a 2600family audience demographic sample compiled by the A C Nielsen Company shows that most of the women who watch Cagney  Lacey are collegeeducated and over 35 they make more money more than 40000 a year and watch less television than the average viewer About a third are men most of them over 35 with a slight increase in male viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 after ABCs competing show Monday Night Football ends its season Children and teenagers make up only 8 percent of the audience The shows popularity with an older affluent audience is of particular importance to CBS which has tried in the last few years to woo that segment of the population while NBC and ABC continue to put a strong emphasis on the youth market Harvey Shephard CBS senior vice president says that the network has sensed a new interest on the part of advertisers in the older audience people between 30 and 60 who really have the bulk of the buying power as members of the babyboom generation a sizable population bulge approach middle age Jerome Dominus vice president network sales for CBSTV is even more plainspoken He feels that the anticipated consumer potential of younger adults has simply not panned out while the Cagney  Lacey audience represents a stable affluent wedge of the buying public Yuppies are a marketing concept without legs he says dismissing younger viewers with an entertainment industry slang term for a movie that fails to continue doing business after it opens They spend all their money on rent I only wish I had more hours like Cagney  Lacey to sell W HILE BARBARA CORday likes to hear CBS representatives enthusiasm for Cagney  Lacey she knows that its increased popularity on screen and at the network does not yet signify a trend No one has attempted to cash in with another dramatic show with female leads The closest copy was what Corday calls that tongueincheek show with Loni Anderson and Lynda Carter Partners in Crime which depended more on the two actresses beautifully dressed and coiffed bodies than on a substantive story line Im not sure that the networks yet believe that you can spread this audience real thin says Corday The attitude is Hey look at what they pulled off They could never do it again  It takes very little to be regarded as a questionable commodity in network television What seemed a reasonable enough proposition  Rosenzweigs initial concept was simply Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid with women  turned out to be revolutionary in network programming terms merely because of the sex change Terry Louise Fisher a novelist and former deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County from 1971 to 1974 came back to Cagney  Lacey after a stint working on Cutter to Houston a medical series She functions in a constant state of amazement at what audiences will and wont tolerate She believes that many viewers still have a problem with women instigating action Typically in American literature and drama men act and women react she says A womans husband dies or her child is kidnapped How does she react Women in positions of power taking charge of their own life Some men are uncomfortable with it Im sure some women are still uncomfortable with it The majority of primetime programming has always placed women in a kind of ghetto When Cagney  Lacey first aired as a series in early 1982 according to CBSs Harvey Shephard Women were always in comedies Rarely would you find a woman in a drama in a lead If she was she played a nonthreatening type  a nurse or a mother  or she was a 19yearold sex object The National Commission on Working Womens report called The Picture Improves A Look at the 1984 Television Season sees improvement in the situation but not by much In the 1984 television season 66 percent of all women on new shows were between 20 and 40 years old and only 16 percent were married Although 76 percent of the characters worked they presented an updated but still unrealistic picture Most of the characters had professional occupations in contrast to the 51 percent of working women in real life who hold clerical and service jobs The handful of women characters who go against this grain are often judged by harsh standards Christine Cagney  who no longer anticipates the arrival of Mr Right  continues to be regarded critically by many viewers for behavior that would seem acceptable in a man With some chagrin Sharon Gless who plays Detective Cagney recalls attending a wedding where she met a man who chatted happily with her about the show  Hows your partner Please give her my best he said I think shes just wonderful And he went on like that she says So I said Well Thank you very much because he hadnt said anything about Christine And he said Dont take me wrong Its just that you frighten me You Sharon dont  but Christine does Gless who among other things had appeared in several movies for television a failed situation comedy and as the replacement for Lynn Redgrave on the series House Calls was initially reluctant to try another series  especially since she would be the third actress to portray the rather defensive often caustic Detective Cagney But the part was impossible to resist Gless is a single woman in her early 40s who like her character isj trying to come to terms with the notion that she may not marry and will probably not have children She has come to share Tyne Dalys strong emotional commitment to her character Barbara Corday and her cowriter Barbara Avedon may have created Christine Cagney but shes mine now The characters unmarried status does not hold a similar appeal for CBS whose response to stories involving Detective Cagney and romance reflects the belief that the only true states of grace for a woman are being married or actively looking for a spouse Viewers according to network officials wont understand a woman whos had an offer and turned it down Barbara Corday laughs Weve been accused of Christine being promiscuous  but shes barely what I consider to be a healthy active heterosexual female Last season the writers introduced a character named Dory for Christine Cagney to fall in love with but they did not want her to marry him The network according to the writerproducer Steve Brown wanted a dramatic breakup Either Dory dies or he does something horrible to Cagney The writers tried Terry Fisher says that she Brown and Peter Lefcourt a writerproducer were running to Barneys office with various reasons Christine would break up with Dory Hed look at them and say This isnt realistic Why do they break up Because she doesnt want to be married She doesnt need to be married But that is a radical statement to be made in America today I N A WAY THE SHOW had its origins in 1974 when Rosenzweig who describes himself as a product of the 1950s    used to a woman whose primary function was managing the home and children met Barbara Corday the first working woman modernday type I had ever spent time with She and Barbara Avedon wrote a script about two women cops and Rosenzweig with the energy only a newborn feminist could muster shopped it around for five years He tried to get the script made as a theatrical film a television series and as a movie for television As he ruefully recalls I sent it to the network drama departments as a drama with comedy and I sent it to their comedy departments as a comedy with drama Turned down by everybody CBS finally agreed to make a movie for television ratings convinced the network to proceed with a series in early 1982 with Tyne Daly and Meg Foster the latter replacing Loretta Swit who had played Detective Cagney in the television movie After two episodes the show was scheduled to be canceled at the end of the season because of poor ratings Rosenzweig asked the network for another chance in a new time slot CBS agreed ratings improved and the show was renewed for the 1982 fall season on condition that Foster be replaced At the time an anonymous network source was quoted by TV Guide as saying that the characters were too harshly womens lib    We perceived them as dykes CBS asserts that the real difficulty was that there was too little contrast between the characters  but whatever the explanation the incident hinted at just how chancy a show about two women was considered to be John Karlen who plays Harvey Lacey comments When CBS didnt see an audience right away maybe they thought Its the women maybe we shouldnt have tried it  Karlen has certainly found men resistant to the show If Im stopped on the street 20 times 19 times its a woman The 20th its a man who just appreciates a quality show I dont think its a show a guy can hate unless hes a real chauvinist But a lot of them can and do ignore it In 1983 citing disappointing ratings CBS canceled the series a second time This time an indignant Rosenzweig went to the press on the theory that CBS executives may not read their mail but they do read their newspapers He also sent his two stars out on the stump to plead publicly for another chance CBS relented again renewing the show for 1984 The network says Sharon Gless with a laugh has never allowed us to get cocky A FTER YEARS OF holding their breath Cagney  Lacey staff members are looking toward a season in which the show not its fate is the primary focus Despite the shows difficult schedule Rosenzweig this season instituted longer readthroughs a preliminary group critique of a new script Its an unusual step in a business where there is never enough time but an attempt to allow the actors more chance to suggest revisions At one reading of an upcoming script after a 10hour day on location Rosenzweig gathered the writers and actors together Tyne Daly slumped in her chair while John Karlen rubbed her neck Sharon Gless dragged herself in wearing a pink bathrobe hoping to stay awake long enough to attend a screening that evening of a television movie she had made Although everyone was numbingly tired they went through the script twice In the zeal that comes of acceptance barely a line of script sneaks by unchallenged Daly quietly but firmly requested that the word just be deleted whenever it appeared in Mary Beths or Christines dialogue Tyne Daly had done some reading early in the season on womens speech patterns particularly the use of what she and Terry Louise Fisher call diminishing words Women are just a little tired while men are tired period Thus Mary Beth Lacey will say Lets go instead of Lets just go speaking to the women of America in the strongest voice possible And this season what she says will be rather shocking In a segment to be aired in November a story about abortion clinic bombings that Steve Brown has been trying to do for two years Mary Beth Lacey will confess that she had an illegal abortion in Puerto Rico when she was younger This is the solution to the problem posed months before at that emergency staff meeting at Rosenzweigs house How could she be against abortion for herself today without appearing to take a stance against a womans right to abortion If the coming season looks promising the Cagney  Lacey team has learned to expect  perhaps even relish  surprises They are good soldiers in the war against primetime stereotypes if a season went too smoothly they would probably feel that they had failed had provided shows that were too TV Rosenzweigs ultimate criticism He and his band have come to consider threats of cancellation hassles over content shouting matches and political debate as indications that Cagney  Lacey must be doing something right
NBC'S 'GOLDEN GIRLS' GAMBLES ON GROWN-UPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/arts/nbc-s-golden-girls-gambles-on-grown-ups.html,When it comes to women television has always had an obsessive love affair with youth Creamy skin and firm thighs are a prerequisite for leading roles Actresses with wrinkles play the ingenues mother or  if the actress was once a major movie star  the matriarch of a harumscarum clan of voracious young people A womans worth is tied into what she looks like says Susan Harris At 82 Cary Grant could still be a romantic lead But on television a woman over 50 is cast as an ax murderer Miss Harris is the creator of The Golden Girls a new NBC situation comedy Saturdays at 9 PM about two widows and a divorcee women nearing 60 who live together in Miami  and the 80yearold mother of the divorcee who moves in when her retirement home burns down The most surprising thing about The Golden Girls  which stars Bea Arthur Betty White Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty  is that nearly everybody is sure the show will be a hit The opening episode on Sept 14 was the weeks highestrated program Paul Schulman who buys 165 million worth of television advertising a year for clients has purchased The Golden Girls for RalstonPurina not because older people have dogs and cats but because younger people have dogs and cats too and The Golden Girls will do extremely well with younger people Its a mistake to think that younger people wont watch just because the show deals with older women says Mr Schulman Whos home on Saturday night An awful lot of people who used to be big Love Boat fans and who will eat Golden Girls up When the shows being taped audiences stand up and applaud those four terrific ladies for two minutes Betty White is frightened by the rain of praise from television writers that has already landed on the heads of the golden girls In all the hundred years Ive been in this business Ive never seen this kind of prehype she says Well at least they cant miss the fact were on We will not go down by default Miss Harris who wrote the controversial Maudes Abortion segment of Maude and created both Soap and Benson is also scared At least she grins its a highclass problem to have There is a second astonishing thing about The Golden Girls The idea was not sold to NBC It came from the network And it came in August 1984 before CBSs Murder She Wrote starring Angela Lansbury proved that a series that focused on a middleaged woman could be a popular success On a promotional program for our 1984 season Selma Diamond did a oneminute sketch introducing Miami Vice  says Warren Littlefield NBC vice president for series She said something like  Miami Nice It must be about a bunch of old people sitting around playing pinochle On television youre always looking for the handsome 35yearold leading man with a sense of humor Youre looking for Magnum And hes impossible to find I said to Brandon at least we could cast Miami Nice  Brandon Tartikoff president of NBC Entertainment agreed And when two television producers Paul Witt and Tony Thomas came in a few weeks later to pitch an idea for a series they were told We dont like your idea But well give you one Take some women around 60 Society has written them off has said theyre over the hill We want them to be feisty as hell and having a great time You wont put it on the air was Mr Witts suspicious response He was given a commitment for 13 episodes before a single word was written We knew the show would be breaking one of the basic television rules says Mr Littlefield But all of our best shows scared us a bit We propelled Golden Girls because we knew there would be nothing like it on the air And in the last year or two what has worked on television is whats different Like most television writers Susan Harris  Mr Witts wife and other partner  wanted desperately to get out of television and into movies After four years of writing nearly every episode of Soap she was so burned out physically and emotionally that she didnt write again for a year Her husband teasingly calls her CreatorDeserter because she typically creates a show and then runs away I had to write Golden Girls says Miss Harris who is 44 years old  lithe and longlimbed in a white pullover sweater with tawny Farrah Fawcett hair cascading around her face Ive never gotten excited about a network idea before but this was compelling I could write grownups Television is always several steps behind life When do you see passionate older people on television Two weeks ago we were rehearsing a show in which Betty White has her first affair since the death of her husband 15 years ago There was one scene in which she and the man passionately kiss I dont think Ive ever seen that before on television There is life after 50 People can be attractive energetic have romances When do you see people of this age in bed together Eventually on this show you will Its kind of pathetic that this show is televisions baby steps On a recent Wednesday morning the four stars were rehearsing a show in which Rose the slightly dimwitted innocent played by Betty White was being sold a clunky used car by Blanche  the vain and selfcentered Southern belle played by Rue McClanahan Unlike Rose Blanche has rarely been without a man since her husbands death At the center of the episode Dorothy  the nononsense schoolteacher played by Bea Arthur  was having an affair with a married man to the horror of her 80yearold mother Sophia played by Estelle Getty Sophia has suffered a small stroke which destroyed the part of her brain that censors her tongue so she constantly blurts out what everyone else is too polite to say Miss Arthurs Dorothy is less strident and harsh than Maude the character with whom she is most identified But she dominates the household because she is the smartest of the women and according to Miss McClanahan the bravest Lets face it says Miss Arthur Nobody ever asked me to play Juliet Barelegged in white ducks and wearing no makeup or jewelry Miss Arthur is as brisk and commanding as her character In a fluffy white sexy looped sweater Miss McClanahan epitomizes hers It is Betty White who is playing furtherest from her real persona as Rose who makes an art of naivete In real life says Miss White Its my disease to smart off After listening to the others argue with the director Jim Drake over changing several lines in the script she cracks Hey my father has a barn Lets get some costumes and put on a show Out of character the three women often play off each other like a comedy team Trying to get a line past the censor Miss McClanahan suggests She shot him in the doolollies Thats a Southern expression She shot him in the West Indies questions Miss Arthur She shot him in his pajamas suggests Miss White Miss McClanahan turns and catches a loop of her sweater on a chair She shot him in the loops says Miss White triumphantly When theyre not satisfied they worry the lines to death like a dog with a bone says Mr Drake Between them they have a hundred years of television experience Miss White and Miss McClanahan worked together in the series Mamas Family in 1983 For six years Miss McClanahans Vivian was Maudes best friend Miss Getty  who reached the spotlight late as Harvey Fiersteins mother in Torch Song Trilogy  is the odd woman out She has never done a television series or even lived in California before But there is no weak link in our chain says Miss Arthur Eating a box of Milk Duds she gestures toward the candy For the first time there isnt a dud in the crowd A few years ago I was in a series that had me crying my eyes out and my agent said This is what television really is Bea But we are four women who respect each other Its like being back with Norman Lear Its a joy Words about camaraderie come easy The proof is that all four women are willing to give their funniest lines away if they feel the jokes would work better in the mouth of another character Well even suggest it says Miss Getty They mesh so well that the fifth main character  a homosexual cook who was created to interact with the women individually was dropped after the pilot episode Only a few years older than the other three women despite the age of the character she is playing Miss Getty is also the only one who is married Both Miss White and Miss Arthur have elderly sick mothers living with them Miss McClanahan is divorced Miss Arthurs 25year marriage to the director Gene Saks ended in divorce under the pressures of Maude Miss White who was married to the game show host Allen Ludden for 18 years was widowed four years ago Golden Girls will deal with aging in many ways There are the jokes about incontinence and sagging skin There is the moment when Dorothy sees an old womans face in the mirror and does not recognize it as her own There is the rush of new romance And there is the vulnerability When the house is robbed Miss Whites character feels vulnerable to the point of paralysis and is angry at her dead husband for having abandoned her A couple of speeches Rose makes get me by the throat says Miss White All I have to do is substitute Allen for Charlie Roses husband All four women are reveling in The Golden Girls As actors we do whats handed to us says Miss Getty but to be able to do something thats up your alley is icing on the cake Beyond their own pleasure they hope the show might have some consciousnessraising effects Miss White hopes that The Golden Girls will prove that you dont selfdestruct after a certain age Miss Getty wants it to erase the notion the world is Noahs Ark and no woman is worth the powder to blow her to hell with unless shes attached to a man Nonsense argues Miss Arthur that was taken care of 15 years ago When I was a child I used to question why a woman took her husbands name She wants the show to demonstrate that middleaged people are gutsy and juicy And Miss McClanahan thinks it important to show that when people mature they add layers They dont turn into other creatures The truth is we all still have our child our adolescent and our young woman living in us

A VOICE FOR CONTROL OF THE POPULATION EXPLOSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/style/a-voice-for-control-of-the-population-explosion.html,At first glance Avabai B Wadia does not strike those around her as a person in the vortex of one of the worlds most divisive issues  population control Refined small in stature and ever so slightly stooped as she begins her 73d year she does not look like an advocate of any sort Indeed when she attended an awards ceremony at the United Nations she sat on the dais a lone woman dwarfed by the graysuited men on either side But when Mrs Wadia took the podium her commanding voice and persuasive message captured and held the audiences attention For when it comes to promoting family planning worldwide Mrs Wadia president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation has few equals The facts and Mrs Wadias concerns are simple Every minute 150 people are added to the worlds population that is 80 million a year By the year 2025 according to the United Nations the planet whose population now is estimated at 46 billion will have 81 billion inhabitants One of the major reasons for the unchecked growth the federation says is limited access to effective contraceptive techniques particularly in the developing world Mrs Wadia said that more than 500 million women have had unwanted pregnancies largely because they knew little about birth control and had limited access to contraceptives Surely she said this amounts to a subtle coercion of women to keep on having babies because they do not know of or cannot exercise other options For more than three decades Mrs Wadia has tried to give them options helping couples to control the number of children they produce In many ways her career embodies the family planning movements successes and frustrations Those frustrations multiplied last December when the Reagan Administration cut off 17 million in supplies and grants to the federation Pressed by conservatives the Agency for International Development which controls aid to overseas populationcontrol programs said it was acting because some federation affiliates promote abortion Since then the federation which has member associations in more than 120 nations has cut administrative costs solicited replacement supplies from other donors and reduced or eliminated projects among them most of a familyplanning program in Ethiopia and scheduled projects in 18 other African nations For Mrs Wadia the battle with Washington is perhaps the most serious challenge to the organization which she helped found It is not the first such challenge she has faced Mrs Wadia was born on Sept 18 1913 in Colombo in what is now Sri Lanka to Indian parents and is a citizen of India When she was barely in her teens her mother enrolled her in a grammar school in England My mother was one of those millions of Indian women who didnt get much schooling who didnt get chances Mrs Wadia said Therefore she was determined that her daughter should get all the chances possible At a time when most young Indian women would not dream of even a highschool education she studied law at the University of London At 19 she received her law degree  the first woman from her country to do so Shortly thereafter the law college in Colombo the islands capital opened its doors to women When she moved to Bombay however Mrs Wadia chose to work in the cause of womens welfare She had begun to do so in London where as one of a handful of educated Indian women she was often called upon to speak to British womens groups In India she joined the AllIndia Womens Conference and shortly thereafter found her calling Concern for Womens Health The status of womens health in general was terribly low Mrs Wadia said One of the reasons was that they had too many pregnancies Hoping to surpass what she called the rather feeble efforts of their predecessors the AllIndia Womens Conference organized the first international assembly on family planning in Bombay in 1952 Out of that grew the International Planned Parenthood Federation In the intervening years Mrs Wadia longtime president of Indias family planning association has had a major role in national and international family planning She has participated in all the major conferences including last years 145nation gathering in Mexico City Through the family of her husband Dr Bomanji K Wadia who died in 1979 she developed strong contacts in the Indian Government and as early as 1951 got family planning included in official policies and budgets She has also become something of a grande dame on the international womens scene After the United Nations conference in July marking the end of the Decade for Women she said her worries that family planning issues would receive short shrift at the conference had been unfounded In fact controversy prevailed At a workshop on family planning and development sponsored by her international federation Mrs Wadia faced vigorous opposition to the birth control methods advocated by the federation from opponents of abortion and advocates of natural methods Arguments continued through the conference she says but then adds with satisfaction I dont think they made much headway Dismisses White House Argument That incident and the federations troubles with Washington are just two of the many signs that population control has become a political hot potato But Mrs Wadia does not avoid the fray In a voice that speaks from experience she dismisses the argument advanced by the Reagan Administration that freemarket economic growth can provide the ability to cope with an expanding population Anybody who believes that she says has never been anywhere in the developing world  there are too many of the absolute poor and you just cant leave it to laissezfaire
ABOUT EDUCATION;   A Call for Teaching Morals and Ethics in Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/24/science/about-education-a-call-for-teaching-morals-and-ethics-in-schools.html,SHOULD the schools teach morals and ethics and if so how President Reagan and William J Bennett his Secretary of Education have recently accused the schools of being value neutral but their plea for the teaching of moral values has aroused controversy because it was linked to their quest for prayers in the schools This makes many parents and others nervous because they believe in the wall that separates church and state But the latest demand that public schools should instruct children on matters of ethics and morals comes from a man within the education establishment who is not suspect of wanting to breach that wall Bill Honig Californias superintendent of public instruction a former corporate lawyer who gave up the law to teach in innercity schools attacks valueneutral teaching in his book Last Chance for Our Children AddisonWesley Publishing Company 1295 As a school reformer Mr Honig has pushed for higher academic standards for all children His demand for tougher requirements please educational conservatives but he recently proved his independent if not liberal views by turning down all seventh and eighthgrade science textbooks submitted to the state for approval because their treatment of evolution had been diluted in an apparent effort to placate fundamentalists who want to give equal time to the Biblical account of creation Mr Honig said the issue went beyond evolution to the general dumbing down of textbooks In his book Mr Honig recalls his surprise at learning that after making his case for the teaching of moral and ethical values before a group of college students a faculty member called his plea dangerously reactionary and to undo the damage assigned a paper on the hazards of the religiouspolitical group Moral Majority taking over the schools Mr Honig says he thinks this panicky confusion of his position on teaching ethics and moral values with an embrace of the doctrinaire agenda of Bible Belt evangelism is not at all unusual There is he adds a difference between those who want group prayer in the public schools a practice of religion and those who want moral content in the curriculum a fundamental purpose of the schools The controversy is a hangover from the 1960s when radical students and their adult mentors denounced the teaching of traditional values as autocratic Some educators turned to the concept of values clarification under which pupils discussed various strategies of dealing with moral questions without any agreedupon base of what is right or wrong The topic is also treated in a recent book Yes Virginia There is Right and Wrong by Dr Kathleen M Gow Mr Honig says he believes that children are not automatically moral or ethical This view clashes with the concept of children as noble savages whose inherent goodness will emerge if they are protected from societys corruption Public sentiment today is in Mr Honigs corner In a Gallup Poll last year on a variety of goals for the public schools the development of standards of what is right and wrong ranked second after the ability to speak and write correctly Abdication of the responsibility to teach moral and ethical values Mr Honig asserts says to children that we adults dont hold anything sacred How is Mr Honigs goal to be accomplished The teacher as role model is important but so are examples within what is taught about such broad principles as the sanctity of human life respect for the dignity of the individual and the importance of the family and personal moral effort It includes an understanding of the guarantees of freedom of speech religion association and the press and of equality before the law Values Mr Honig writes can be taught through literature For example The Ox Bow Incident by Walter van Tilburg Clark shows that vigilantes are intolerable in a free society Mr Honig tells teachers Our literature has a way of deflating ideologues and true believers of every stripe Are you a laissezfaire capitalist Then read Frank Norriss The Octopus and squirm An unregenerate Bolshevik Try Arthur Koestlers Darkness at Noon Pacifists should be sure to read The Diary of Anne Frank or William Shakespeares Henry V And Marine Corps recruits should study Stephen Cranes The Red Badge of Courage or Erich Maria Remarques All Quiet on the Western Front But he also warns that the classroom is not the place for settling adult squabbles For instance he says children should not be taught that all opponents of a nuclear freeze are warmongers nor that all who favor a womans right to abortion are murderers Still problems remain Children do not live in a vacuum within the walls of their classroom They see unethical adult behavior often in high places In teaching them what is right schools cannot ignore what is wrong in the adult world Children are quick to spot hypocrisy and it may be better to inspire in them contempt for adult wrongdoing than to pretend that it does not exist In 1973 Dr Karl Menninger the noted psychiatrist tackled the same issues in a book Whatever Became of Sin Like Mr Honig he pointed to the lessons of history both for good and evil for the transmission of values He would undoubtedly share Mr Honigs alarm at hearing that after a course on the Holocaust taught by Prof Robert M Hunt at Harvard a majority of students considered the rise of Hitler inevitable leaving no one responsible for the slaughter of six million Jews Professor Hunt denounced that as unacceptable nofault history Mr Honig adds Let them study the life of Raoul Wallenberg the Swedish diplomat who saved many Jews in Budapest Nofault history Nofault corporate wrongdoing Nofault cheating on tests They are all of a piece The question of what to blame  the adult example or the schools lack of teaching  is hard to answer Mr Honig makes a strong case that the schools must carry out their responsibility But the schools task would be more manageable if adults did not expect them to swim upstream against real world ethics and morality
U.S. DENIES FAMILY PLANNING AID TO A U.N. GROUP,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/26/world/us-denies-family-planning-aid-to-a-un-group.html,The United States today redirected 10 million originally allocated for United Nationssponsored population control programs saying they include one in China that uses coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization The move was a crucial step in the controversy over American support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities The Reagan Administrations earlier decision to withhold the 10 million has strained relations with Peking which has repeatedly insisted that its population programs have no involuntary measures The executive director of the population activities fund Rafael M Salas said tonight that his agency was deeply distressed by the decision and he took issue with the American finding Mr Salas said his organization does not support abortion or coercion in any country and pointed out that earlier American reviews of the United Nations assistance to China had agreed While the donor countries have the right to decide whether or not to contribute to UNFPA Mr Salas said the withdrawal of a commitment firmly made can only jeopardize the future of multilateral cooperation in population and other development activities Population control lobbyists in Washington immediately condemned the United States action saying it would lead to a total end to American support which provides about onethird of the agencys financing If you can cut off 10 million because the China program is determined to be coercive then you can cut off the whole thing said one lobbyist Kathleen Mazzocco of the Population Crisis Committee Decision by AID The announcement today was made by M Peter McPherson administrator of the Agency for International Development which determines aid for international population control programs Mr McPherson said his agency had found sufficient evidence that the Chinese Governments policy of one child for each family had resulted in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization Mr McPherson said his agency might give money to the United Nations program in the fiscal year 1986 which starts Oct 1 if the Chinese moved to correct what he called abuses in enforcing their program or if the Fund for Population Activities was to radically change its assistance to the China program The 10 million will now be given to twoway population family planning programs and to American organizations that provide family planning services an agency statement said Reprogramming these funds reflects the Administrations policy to provide substantial support for voluntary family planning but firm opposition to abortion and coercive family population practices the statement said United Nations officials and diplomats have said that any cut in American support for the population fund will be devastating to the organizations programs in Africa and Asia The population control group supports family planning programs in more than 100 developing nations

THE RACE IS LOW-KEY FOR KOCH AND 3 RIVALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/29/nyregion/the-race-is-low-key-for-koch-and-3-rivals.html,With Election Day only five weeks off Mayor Koch is running a lowkey campaign by choice while his three major opponents are operating lowvisibility campaigns by necessity an acute shortage of campaign funds Hell float like a butterfly David Garth the Mayors campaign strategist said of Mr Kochs plans to ignore his opponents as much as possible In effect the Mayor is counting on his overwhelming primary victory and a 5to1 Democratic enrollment edge in the city to carry him to election for a third term His major rivals are Diane McGrath a member of the State Crime Victims Compensation Board who is the RepublicanConservative candidate City Council President Carol Bellamy who was defeated by Mr Koch in the Sept 10 Democratic primary and is the Liberal Party candidate and Rabbi Lew Y Levin of Brooklyn who is the Right to Life Party candidate Well use this campaign to pull the city and the Democratic Party together Mr Garth said of his plans for limited mailings endorsement news conferences and some Koch radio and television commercials to be broadcast the week before the election to get out the vote Competition for Second Place Mr Garth said he agreed with many politicians that the election campaign is a contest for second place between Mrs McGrath and Miss Bellamy In the 1977 mayoral election Mario M Cuomo running on the Liberal line ran a strong second to Mr Koch who was then seeking his first term while the Republican candidate State Senator Roy M Goodman received only about 5 percent of the vote Mr Cuomos showing kept his political career alive and the following year he was elected Lieutenant Governor In the 1981 mayoral election the Liberal candidate Mary Codd dropped to fourth place Assemblyman Frank Barbaro of Brooklyn running as an independent after his defeat in the Democratic primary ran second to Mr Koch who had Democratic and Republican endorsement Mrs McGrath a political unknown making her first run for public office this week plans to hold the first in a series of news conferences on various issues to gain as much attention as possible in the face of limited campaign funds and an incumbent who is avoiding debates and joint appearances Hopes to Make a Commercial The McGrath campaign has raised about 110000 so far according to the treasurer Timothy P Hellmuth Mrs McGrath said she hoped to make at least one television commercial Miss Bellamy with only about 25000 in her campaign treasury said she intended to run a serious campaign but she added Im also a realistic person Liberal Party supporters and Bellamy aides said she hoped to run at least second and capture more than the 19 percent of the vote she took in the Democratic primary to keep some political credibility for the future This is her only salvation said Raymond B Harding head of the Liberal Party faction supporting Miss Bellamy If she loses the election she will leave office on Dec 31 and is expected to practice law The state leadership of the Liberal Party the Rev Dr Donald S Harrington and James F Notaro are organizing a Liberals for Koch group Dr Harrington said They also plan to invite Mr Koch as a featured guest along with Governor Cuomo and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York to the annual Liberal Party dinner on Oct 31 Rabbi Levin the Right to Life candidate said he viewed the distinction between McGrath and Levin as the issue He said he questioned the sincerity of Mrs McGraths talking family issues now He said he was referring to abortion homosexuality and sex education Where has she been in recent years Rabbi Levin asked Head of the Family Defense Coalition the rabbi said he was using the campaign as a method of alerting people to the fact that there is an organized group concerned with such issues He and his supporters have been picketing a homosexual bathhouse in the East Village in an effort to have such places closed to prevent the spread of AIDS acquired immune deficiency syndrome Encounter With the Mayor Until now Mrs McGraths campaign has been largely appearances at street fairs and at Republican functions She said she had encountered the Mayor only once at the Steuben Day Parade when she said a Koch advance man tried to remove her from the parade or at least from proximity to the Mayor Koch aides denied the contention Echoing Miss Bellamy in the primary Mrs McGrath said she would make an issue of what she called the Koch administrations lack of planning on such issues as education mass transit crime housing and AIDS She said her theme would be not what the government says its going to do but what its really doing In an interview at her state office she said Mr Koch had not done much other than be a showman She was also somewhat critical of the five Republican county leaders in the city saying she would do things differently and promote more cooperation and coordination among them At least two of the leaders Senator Goodman who is the Manhattan Republican leader and State Senator John D Calandra of the Bronx had favored endorsement of Mr Koch this year as the party did in 1981 Indeed Senator Goodman has invited Mr Koch to a Goodman fundraising event next month and Mrs McGrath said she was unhappy over the invitation No More Bickersons Miss Bellamy declined to say whether she would shift her tactics from the strong criticism of Mr Koch in the primary but Mr Harding said she would She was doing the Bickersons with Koch calling him a phony and a fraud Thats out Mr Harding said referring to the popular 1940s radio serial He said she too would emphasize what she calls the lack of planning in the Koch administration As for the Liberal Party split Mr Harding referred to Dr Harrington by asking how a state party chairman can ask people to vote on another party line Two of Miss Bellamys top aides in the primary campaign Edward C Wallace and Morri Berman have returned to the payroll of the Council Presidents staff and will only work part time on the general election campaign Ray Harding and the Liberal Party will steer the campaign said Mr Wallace adding that resources are limited In contrast Mr Koch who spent close to 6 million in the primary and still has more than 300000 left might spend up to 750000 in the next five weeks Mr Garth said He said the Mayor would target black voters in an effort to improve his standing among them and might also try to demonstrate party and racial unity by seeking a reconciliation with such black leaders as City Clerk David N Dinkins who is running for Manhattan borough president Mr Garth said Koch spending would depend to some extent on the McGrath campaign The key question is whether she can raise substantial funds he said I doubt it The general election field will include five other mayoral candidates Gilbert Di Lucia of the Coalition Party Lenora B Fulani of the New Alliance Party Andrea Gonzalez of the Socialist Workers Party Marjorie Stamberg of the Spartacist Party and Jarvis Tyner of the People Before Profits Party

PAPERBACKS;   PORNOGRAPHY AS PARADOX,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/29/books/paperbacks-pornography-as-paradox.html,WOMEN AGAINST CENSORSHIP Edited by Varda Burstyn 210 pp Manchester NH Salem House Paper 895 MAGIC MOMMAS TREMBLING SISTERS PURITANS  PERVERTS Feminist Essays By Joanna Russ 119 pp Trumansburg NY The Crossing Press Paper 695 Cloth 1695 AS a general rule feminists should probably not say mean things about each other when members of the enemy camp some would say enemy sex may be listening Yet in the recent past the level of intrafeminist invective on one issue has sometimes threatened to surpass the antifeminist invective from the far right The issue is pornography One side would like to prohibit it or at least rule that it is an infringement on womens civil rights The other side has been for the most part not so sure Feminism in the past has been undone by sex  or at least baffled by what sexual liberation might mean in the context of a sexist society  and it would be a sad thing if todays movement were to be undone by its more squalid representations But as feminists have contemplated the appalling tangle of sex and violence represented in sadistic pornography and expressed in everyday life as rape and womanbattering the issue has imposed itself Many feminists have concluded that male sexuality is inherently violent and that male sexual violence is singularly abetted by the images available in adult bookstores and even in the more respectable centerfold magazines Led by a feminist writer Andrea Dworkin and a lawyer Catherine MacKinnon antipornography activists began to crusade in 1983 for local ordinances that would make pornography a form of discrimination on the basis of sex and hence in effect illegal Not only feminists are offended by pornography of course and in one of the cruder ironies of recent history the DworkinMacKinnon forces found themselves working together in several localities with representatives of the antifeminist radical right It was probably the spectacle of such an unseemly alliance more than anything else that galvanized the anticensorship forces Women Against Censorship a collection edited by Varda Burstyn a writer and a video producer and Magic Mommas Trembling Sisters Puritans  Perverts Feminist Essays by the sciencefiction writer and novelist Joanna Russ illustrate admirably that feminism is still a complex boisterous disputatious political movement and not yet a singleissue drive for social purity To summarize the major arguments advanced by Joanna Russ and by Varda Burstyn and her contributors no one can agree on what pornography is and even if we could it would probably not do women much good to expunge it from every newsstand bookstore and cable channel in the land possibly it would do a great deal of harm The distinction between what falls into the pejorative category of pornography and what belongs under the more estimable heading of erotica seems to be largely a matter of taste As a number of Miss Burstyns contributors Lynn King Lisa Duggan Nan Hunter and Carole S Vance point out some of us would suppress Deep Throat and its ilk while others would happily throw out Our Bodies Ourselves and the work of Judy Blume Defining pornography as a form of discrimination against women hardly narrows the field for surely the censors eye would then be drawn to the more familiar examples of cultural sexism that surround us every day in romance novels detergent commercials and the Bible Where would one stop The antipornography activists would reply that they have singled out pornography because of its link to violence but Varda Burstyn and another contributor June Callwood argue that this link is tenuous indeed And if the real problem is violence not sex then why not censor the average carchase and shootout film Joanna Russ argues convincingly that the real problem is not sexual imagery even of the sadistic pornographic genre but the mainstream habit of substituting violence for sex Unfortunately the feminists fighting pornography are not represented in Women Against Censorship at all and the uninitiated reader may begin to wonder halfway through these thoughtful essays how anyone could be so misguided and overwrought as to want to use the power of the state to stamp out smut It may be that the two sides are not yet ready to inhabit the same book but Ann Snitow explains the fuss by noting that in the last decade feminists have seen the equal rights amendment defeated abortion rights attacked and poverty feminized Pornography she suggests became the symbol of female defeat proof of womens victimization and the eternal perfidy of men And Lisa Steele suggests that pornography may be an easy target compared with the rest of the feminist agenda  equal rights abortion and economic justice The reader new to feminist infighting as well as the feminist weary of it will enjoy the ebullient essays in Magic Mommas    Whether she is writing about pornography science fiction magazines or growing up in the 1950s Joanna Russ reminds us of how far we have come as well as how far we have to go In fact both books prove what pornography oddly has done for us It has made a lot of good women on both sides rethink the daunting issue of sex and its place in womens liberation And for those who insist the sexual revolution is over these books suggest it may have just begun
REAGAN REQUESTS THAT HECKLER QUIT HER CABINET POST,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/01/us/reagan-requests-that-heckler-quit-her-cabinet-post.html,President Reagan today asked Margaret M Heckler to give up her post as the Secretary of Health and Human Services and to become Ambassador to Ireland Larry Speakes the White House spokesman said that Mrs Heckler in a private meeting with the President asked Mr Reagan for a few days to think about taking the ambassadorship and that he agreed Stops Short of Dismissal Mr Reagans action stopped short of a formal dismissal and some White House officials portrayed it as a promotion But for several months in the face of pressure from some White House aides Mrs Heckler has been struggling to keep her Cabinet position and the responsibility for the Health and Human Services Departments 330 billion budget the largest of any department Aides to Mrs Heckler a 54year old Republican who is a former Representative from Massachusetts said she had asked for todays private meeting with the President to find out whether he was dissatisfied with her work They had said she would resign if he was The 40minute meeting in the Oval Office came after several days of speculation within the White House and the Administration about the future of Mrs Heckler who was appointed Secretary in January 1983 Campaign Inside White House The request by Mr Reagan is considered a victory for Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff who officials said had waged a behindthescenes campaign to have her removed White House aides had said that Mr Regan had grown discontented with Mrs Hecklers management of her department and had often cited a large number of vacancies in senior positions as symptomatic of problems In addition other White House officials have said the department was not aggressive enough on such issues as health care and abortion After the meeting today Mrs Heckler immediately left the White House by a side entrance waving once to reporters as she ducked into her limousine She did not stop to talk and a spokesman for the department said later that she would have no immediate comment Mr Speakes made the announcement after he had been briefed by Mr Regan the chief of staff about Mr Reagans talk with Mrs Heckler During the meeting the President expressed the desire that she serve as his Ambassador to Ireland Mr Speakes said The President believes that Secretary Heckler is wellqualified and in a position to make a valuable contribution as Ambassador to Ireland Mr Speakes added Meanwhile she remains as Secretary of Health and Human Services Asked what would happen if she rejected the offer Mr Speakes said We will have to wait and see what her answer is The ambassadorship to Ireland is vacant and a number of people including House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts have indicated interest in it Consider This a Promotion Mr Speakes repeated today that Mr Reagan was neither seeking to demote Mrs Heckler nor asking her to give up a more prestigious position The President would consider this a promotion he said Mrs Heckler and Elizabeth Hanford Dole the Secretary of Transportion are the only women in the Cabinet Mr Reagan had indicated that he was prepared to make such an offer early today when he told reporters as he met with King Hussein of Jordan that although he was pleased with Mrs Hecklers performance that does not mean I dont have something else that I would want her to do At that time Mr Reagan drew a distinction between dismissing the Secretary and offering her another role within the Administration There has never beeen any thoughts in my mind to fire Margaret Heckler Mr Reagan said I dont know where these stories come from They are not true Aides to the White House chief of staff had indicated privately last week that Mrs Heckler would be out as the Secretary of Health and Human Services but they could not say when that would become official At that time they gave the impression that Mr Reagan had not approved her leaving but that Mr Regan was ready to make such a recommendation No candidate has emerged as a favorite to succeed Mrs Heckler as Secretary Among those who have been mentioned by Administration officials as possible candidates for the job are John A Svahn the assistant to the President for policy development David B Swoap Californias Secretary of Health and Welfare and Linda S McMahon who works for Mr Swoap as the director of the California Department of Social Services Record as Secretary In two and a half years as Secretary of Health and Human Services Mrs Heckler has staunchly defended the fairness of Mr Reagans economic program including cutbacks in welfare and Medicare the health insurance program for the elderly She cites as one of her biggest achievements the introduction of a new Medicare payment system under which the Government pays hospitals a fixed amount for each case depending on the diagnosis This change has been credited with setting off a revolution in the healthcare industry giving hospitals strong new incentives to cut costs and to reduce the length of time patients spend in the hospital Mrs Heckler also lobbied successfully for a new law to facilitate enforcement of childsupport obligations Reports that White House staff efforts were under way to oust Mrs Heckler came to light in August while Mr Reagan was vacationing at his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara At that time Mr Speakes said on behalf of Mr Reagan that the Secretarys position was not in jeopardy Rumors Were Renewed But last week there were similar reports with a slight twist That White House officials were seeking to remove her by offering her the job of Ambassador to Ireland An aide to Mrs Heckler said Saturday that the Irish Government might perceive the Administration as having used the ambassadors position as a dumping ground for someone Donald Regan was trying to get rid of Several White House officials said that Mrs Heckler who voted with moderate Republicans in the House damaged her standing within the Administration last week by attempting to drum up support on Capitol Hill Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah as chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources had been among supporters in Congress with whom Mrs Heckler had consulted about her difficulties with the White House staff Reacting to the Presidents decision Mr Hatch said tonight that Mrs Heckler had done a fine job serving the country and had helped save millions of dollars for taxpayers White House officials had complained privately that she had failed to fill some key positions Mrs Heckler said that it had been the White House that had failed to approve her appointments In addition other officials have complained that she had resisted making Draconian budget cuts within the department and had not aggressively pursued policy initiatives favored by the White House such as curtailing the practice of abortion Mrs Heckler was involved in a wellpublicized divorce trial recently but there has been no indication that it hurt her standing within the Administration

STANFORD PRESIDENT UPHOLDS DOCTORAL STUDENT'S EXPULSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/02/us/stanford-president-upholds-doctoral-student-s-expulsion.html,Donald Kennedy president of Stanford University yesterday upheld a earlier faculty decision to expel a graduate student who had done research in China and accused the student of lying to him The former doctoral candidate in anthropology Steven W Mosher who had appealed to Mr Kennedy to reinstate him said he would now sue Stanford Mr Mosher who is 36 years old said the Stanford presidents decision is particularly disconcerting to me because I was exonerated on many points of fact and some of the charges against me The original decision to dismiss Mr Mosher made by a 110 vote of the anthropology department faculty in February 1983 aroused a widespread dispute over academic freedom Mr Mosher and some of his supporters contended that Stanford had acted after pressure from China which was angered by his research into village life The authorities were upset by a number of things Mr Mosher did including gaining access to a large number of local government documents They also accused him of bribing local officials Two Books Were Critical It was after Mr Mosher spent a year in a village near Canton in 1979 and 1980 as one of the first American scholars permitted to do field research in China that Peking imposed a ban on further field studies by Americans Mr Mosher has subsequently published two books Broken Earth and Journey to the Forbidden China that paint a critical picture of Communist rule in the countryside including the existence of serious rural poverty and the widespread use of forced abortion Despite the controversy Stanford had refused to release details of a 47page report by a faculty committee that investigated Mr Mosher and originally found him guilty of illegal and seriously unethical conduct in China The controversy was intensified by Mr Moshers contention that much of Stanfords evidence against him came from his former wife Maggie So who had threated to ruin him for divorcing her In upholding Mr Moshers expulsion yesterday Mr Kennedy released the text of a 40page letter accompanied by a 35page appendix he sent to the former graduate student detailing his findings The two documents which read in part like a spy thriller complete with code names shed new light on the Mosher case but also deepen some of the mysteries Lack of Candor Charged Mr Kennedy took note of a letter received last year from a Chinese official warning that future cultural exchanges with the United States might be impaired if the university reversed Mr Moshers expulsion It is wrong to give in to a threat Mr Kennedy said It is equally wrong however to alter a decision in order to avoid the appearance of yielding to a threat Mr Kennedy appears to have backed off somewhat from the original charge that Mr Mosher was guilty of illegal and seriously unethical conduct Instead much of the letter concentrates on what Mr Kennedy describes as Mr Moshers lack of candor in discussing his actions with school officials In particular Mr Kennedy said that Mr Mosher had lied to him at a meeting in May about the authorship of a sales receipt for a camera Mr Mosher purchased in Hong Kong for his work in China Mr Kennedy wrote that a recent investigation evidently by a private detective hired by Stanford had found that Mr Mosher fabricated the sales receipt himself In all Mr Kennedy contended that Mr Mosher had witheld information offered conflicting versions of events or deliberately misled him more than a dozen times Free Ride to Japan Mr Kennedy conceded that much of the schools evidence against Mr Mosher came from his former wife and admitted that there was now some doubt about parts of her story In the most striking part of the letter Mr Kennedy said that Miss So had given the school a tape recording that Mr Mosher sent her in 1977 before his work in China in which he bragged about using old Navy identification to get a free ride on an American military flight from California to Japan When questioned by military personnel Mr Mosher said he had a topsecret clearance and so was made a courier for secret material that he took to Japan Dont you think its hilarious that me a fake naval officer and a fake holder of a top secret clearance got to serve as a courier and take all this top secret material to Japan Mr Mosher joked according to Mr Kennedy This incident was not part of the original charges against Mr Mosher Mr Kennedy wrote But he said the episode early in your graduate career at Stanford confirms the departments assessment of your pattern of behavior toward those you deal with
2 CARDINALS JOIN ON ABORTION ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/02/us/2-cardinals-join-on-abortion-issue.html,John Cardinal OConnor of New York and Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago perhaps the nations two most prominent Roman Catholic leaders tried today to dispel what they said was a misperception that they differed in the strength of their opposition to abortion In a news conference here preceding their joint appearance at the University of Notre Dame both agreed there was a widespread view that Cardinal Bernardin had tried to subordinate the Catholic campaign against abortion to such issues as the nuclear arms race while Cardinal OConnor had tried to subordinate other issues to the importance of fighting legalized abortion But both men said this was a mistaken notion Cardinal OConnor asserted that in the past 10 years no one has fought more valiantly in regard to abortion nor has gone on the limb more frequently than Cardinal Bernardin And Cardinal Bernardin said Cardinal OConnor had been supportive of his concept that opposition to abortion the nuclear arms race and capital punishment were linked by a consistent ethic of life The Dignity of Human Life I felt this concept would strengthen our position on abortion not soften it Cardinal Bernardin added Some people misunderstood what I said All the issues are linked by the dignity of human life but the issues are not the same After the news conference the two prelates spoke to a hall filled with teachers and students at Notre Dame on the churchs social ministry in light of the Second Vatican Council A top official of the National Conferences of Catholic Bishops said the appearance of the two Cardinals together at Notre Dame represented a conscious decision by both to alter a public perception that they were at loggerheads and were at opposite poles of Catholic doctrine The official who asked not to be identified said They want to show that theres more that unites them than divides them In his public statements before last years Presidential election Cardinal OConnor emphasized the churchs opposition to abortion and criticized Catholic politicians who personally opposed abortion but did not translate those views into government policy Governor Cuomo of New York and Geraldine A Ferraro the former Congresswoman from Queens who was the 1984 Democratic nominee for Vice President took pains to defend their positions against the criticism implicit in the Cardinals statements Mr Cuomo made a widely acclaimed speech on the subject in the same hall at Notre Dame where the Cardinals spoke today Cardinal OConnor was asked at the news conference to respond to a statement by Mrs Ferraro in a book about to be published that characterized his criticism of her as strident The Cardinal denied that his remarks had used such a tone and said he believed then that her position had misrepresented Catholic teaching Cardinal Bernardin in contrast to Cardinal OConnor made several wellpublicized speeches last year calling on Catholics to adopt a consistent ethic of life by opposing nuclear arms capital punishment and poverty as well as abortion

childbearing age have used the drug since it was licensed in September 1982 The figures suggest that it has probably been used by many women whose acne could have been treated with milder therapy and that some users were apparently poorly informed about the drugs danger or chose to ignore warnings Our data suggest that many of the exposures during pregnancy were potentially preventable said the report which was published by research workers from the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the department of epidemiology of HoffmanLaRoche the manufacturer Use Barred in Pregnancy Carolyn Glynn director of public relations for the drug company said the main point of the study was that the drug should never be used by a pregnant woman She said HoffmanLaRoche had made a major effort to educate physicians and the public on that point and that the new study compiling all known cases of malformations linked to the drug was intended to aid in that educational process The study which reinforces the advice against giving the drug to pregnant women is not expected to affect its use by other patients That the drug was dangerous to the early fetus was known indeed information distributed by the manufacturer with the drug carries an emphatic warning against use in pregnancy Depending on the circumstances under which the patient gets the drug however it is often the case that only the physician and pharmacist see the warning The purpose of the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine was to gauge the magnitude of that risk and to define the kinds of malformations likely to result when the human fetus was exposed to the drug early in development About onefifth of fetuses exposed early to either Thalidomide or Accutane will develop severe malformations The two drugs are different however in that Thalidomide was intended for use as a tranquilizer in pregnant women while Accutane was never intended for use in pregnancy The study covered 154 pregnancies throughout the United States in which the prospective mother was known to have taken the drug Some 67 percent of those women were either already pregnant when they started taking it or were not using contraception to prevent pregnancy at the time and might have been pregnant without knowing it Dermatologists prescribed the drug in 92 percent of the cases The 154 drugexposed pregnancies resulted in birth of 26 normal and 21 malformed infants All the other pregnancies ended in abortion 12 of them spontaneous and the rest induced It is not known how many other children may have been deformed because of misuse of the drug although an effort is being made by the Government and the drug company to find out Drug Taken by Mouth The aborted fetuses were not examined for malformations nor were data available on the reasons for the elective abortions Presumably some were done to avoid the risk having a severely malformed baby In every case the initial exposure preceded the point at which the fetuss organs were completely formed The study was based on case reports received by the drug company and by the Food and Drug Administration The drug which comes in small footballshaped capsules is taken by mouth and is usually prescribed for several days or a few weeks at a time It is supposed to be used only in cases of acne so severe that other less potent drugs have not controlled the outbreak The generic name of Accutane is isoretinoin It is related chemically to vitamin A From studies in animals isoretinoin is known to be teratogenic that is to cause birth defects Pattern of Defects Found It is a very serious matter said Dr Edward J Lammer the principal investigator in the study who is now at Massachusetts General Hospital We make it clear that physicians need to do the pregnancy test on all women in the reproductive age group and that they need to tell the women not to start therapy until they have their next menstrual period The pattern of birth defects found in the 21 affected infants included malformations of the face skull heart brain and thymus gland Most serious were the effects on the brain including hydrocephalus and microcephaly both involving mental retardation The thymus gland is vital to the bodys immune defenses In some of the babies the thymus was abnormally small or missing altogether Among the 21 infants with malformations three were stillborn and nine were born alive but died soon thereafter The deaths were caused by heart defects brain defects or a combination of both
CATHOLICS WARNED ON ABORTION ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/us/catholics-warned-on-abortion-issue.html,The American hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church issued a stern warning yesterday to Catholics who dissent from the churchs opposition to abortion declaring that they were going against higher moral laws as well as church doctrine Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago chairman of the Committee for ProLife Activities of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement from Washington on behalf of the bishops The churchs teaching in this matter is binding not only because the church says so but because this teaching expresses the objective demands placed on all of us by the inherent dignity of human life A Catholic who chooses to dissent from this teaching or to support dissent from it is dissenting not only from church law but from a higher law which the church seeks to observe and teach the statement continued Such dissent can in no way be seen as legitimate alternative teaching Newspaper Ad Recalled The warning was aimed at Catholics who supported a fullpage advertisement published in The New York Times last Oct 7 that said there was a diversity of opinion among Catholics on the morality of abortion The advertisement signed by 97 Catholics including 28 nuns priests and brothers went on to say that it was wrong to hold that the only legitimate Catholic position was that abortion is morally wrong in all instances The Vatican demanded that priests and members of religious orders who signed the statement recant it While that controversy was still simmering many of those responsible for the first advertisement were planning a second advertisement that was to have been published Sunday declaring that the right of Catholics to speak freely was under attack Placement of the second advertisement has been postponed however partly to await what the Vatican will do next Cardinal Bernardins statement appeared to anticipate the second advertisement Catholic leaders say the first advertisement stirred great concern because it created the impression that approval of legalized abortion constituted a legitimate church position The statement yesterday was designed to make explicitly clear that while there can be differences over what strategies should be taken in opposing legalized abortion the institutional church has rejected abortion as a grave moral evil Focus on Natural Laws Russell Shaw a spokesman for the bishops conference said the Bernardin statement focused on the concept of higher laws to clear up any notion that the debate over abortion was simply one over a legislated church canon Were not dealing with canon law here Mr Shaw said but with natural moral laws that have universal validity the Godgiven laws of human behavior not a legislated law Frances Kissling president of Catholics for a Free Choice who is a leading figure behind the advertisement said she regarded the statement yesterday as part of a concerted effort among the United States bishops and the Vatican to tighten the reins of authority The right to dissent and freedom of conscience are central to Catholicism  indeed are the only protection that the Catholic people have against creeping infallibility she said The original advertisement she added did not mean to imply that support for abortion was a correct Catholic teaching but only tried to say that it was a theologically and ethically defensible position Cardinal Bernardins statement was released several days before Respect Life Sunday which marks the start of the churchs annual campaign against legalized abortion and comes after a number of developments that may give the church a public image of greater harmony on the issue Cardinals Say Views Are Same On Tuesday Cardinal Bernardin and John Cardinal OConnor of New York gave a joint discourse at the University of Notre Dame to dispel what both men said was a public misperception that they differed in the fervor of their antagonism to abortion Cardinal Bernardin said his espousal of a consistent ethic of life that linked opposition to abortion with rejection of the nuclear arms race and capital punishment was in no way intended to dilute the churchs campaign against abortion Cardinal OConnor said his preoccupation with the abortion issue in no way signaled his antipathy to the churchs outspokenness on other social issues The signers of the advertisement were the target of criticism earlier this week from an unexpected quarter An editorial in The National Catholic Reporter a progressive Catholic newsweekly denounced plans to run a second advertisement and said the first advertisement was deceitful in confusing the issue of free speech and the churchs right to maintain the integrity of its teachings In August Jean Jerome Cardinal Hamer head of the Vaticans Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes said the nuns who signed the advertisement had caused a scandal that could only be remedied by indicating adherence to the teaching of the church Failure to sign a statement of adherence would result in disciplinary hearings and could lead to the nuns dismissal from their religious orders
Judging a Judge Buckley,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/04/opinion/judging-a-judge-buckley.html,On the advice of the Justice Department former Senator James Buckley declined to talk to New York Citys bar association about his qualifications for the Federal appeals court in Manhattan The associations judiciary committee responded by issuing a public rating of not approved for the nomination which the department has not yet recommended to the White House The cause of justice will survive this unfortunate impasse but it exposes many of the conflicts between politicians and lawyers over proper personnel for the Federal bench The department allows the American Bar Association to comment confidentially on candidates for the bench but didnt want the extra hassle of dealing with the city bar It feared the city lawyers would unfairly disapprove the Buckley appointment because of professional and political bias That concern was understandable but it was unwise to recommend against the bar appearance The Administrations problem is to some extent President Reagans fault Before his term is out he stands to appoint more judges than any previous President and he has pledged to staff the Federal bench with judges who share his views particularly on abortion and family relations These are dubious standards and provoke justifiable concern Bar associations of course are not without their own political values agendas and candidates They like judges well seasoned in law practice Mr Buckley is not having devoted himself mostly to a family business and public office The bias toward professionalism caused the New York bar association to lead a vigorous though unsuccessful fight against confirmation of Thomas Meskill a former Governor of Connecticut to sit on the same appeals court He has in fact served well the bar might have learned not to underrate the value of a lawyers public service But questions of bias are properly addressed to Mr Buckley as well He made dramatically clear his opposition to abortion last year As President Reagans representative to the United Nations conference on population control he opposed aid to familyplanning groups supporting abortion even if they used no Federal funds to do so Could he surmount that personal abhorrence and follow the law The Senate should pursue those questions if Mr Buckley is nominated The bar has missed a chance to demonstrate that it has outgrown the parochialism of the Meskill affair Mr Buckley has missed a chance to prove his professionalism to the legal community that he would serve
STANFORD ASSERTS CHINA RESEARCHER IS EXPELLED LIED ABOUT HIS USE OF GRANT FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/05/us/stanford-asserts-china-researcher-is-expelled-lied-about-his-use-of-grant-funds.html,In the spring of 1980 someone purchased a truck in Hong Kong and donated it to a Chinese village near Canton where a graduate student from Stanford University was doing research Now after a fouryear investigation by Stanford which included private detectives and handwriting experts the school believes that the student Steven W Mosher bought the truck with research funds intended for purchasing photographic equipment The misuse of funds emerged as a central charge against Mr Mosher in a 75page letter written Monday by Donald Kennedy the president of Stanford upholding a 1983 faculty vote to expel Mr Mosher from the schools doctoral program in anthropology It was Stanfords first detailed account of its decision to dismiss him an action that touched off a dispute over academic freedom and raised charges by Mr Mosher and others that Stanford had given in to pressure from Peking Mr Mosher who is 36 years old was among the first American scholars allowed to work in China after the normalization of relations between Peking and Washington in 1979 He has since published two books in which he paints a picture of widespread rural poverty and Government pressure on women to have abortions and Peking officials accused Mr Mosher of improper behavior in the course of his research Earlier Report Kept Secret An earlier report by a faculty investigative committee accusing Mr Mosher of illegal and seriously unethical conduct in China has been kept secret And in Mr Kennedys letter on the sensitive issue the truck is referred to only as the object although there are several clues to its identity Mr Kennedy explained that disclosing the nature of the transaction could pose the threat of serious harm to innocent parties in China For his part Mr Mosher would not say whether the mystery object was a truck But he contended that his wife then Maggie So whose relatives lived in the village had bought a truck at the time and given it to a local official Maggie and her clan purchased the truck Mr Mosher said in a telephone interview to help start a small textile factory and get permission to get some of their family out to Hong Kong Such deals have become relatively common under Pekings relaxed economic policy in recent years The key evidence against Mr Mosher came from Miss So who had threatened to ruin him after they were divorced in 1980 Mr Kennedy conceded in his letter that much of the evidence about the object came from Miss So and that there were some erroneous details in her account Nevertheless Mr Kennedy wrote my opinion is that much of her story is true Detectives Report a Key Mr Kennedys letter reads like a spy thriller with many individuals identified only by a letter of the alphabet and with reports of how detectives hired by the school tried to discover who had purchased the object Indeed Mr Kennedy wrote that he finally decided to uphold Mr Moshers explusion only after receiving a report from a Hong Kong detective agency last week concluding that Mr Mosher had fabricated the sales receipt for a Nikon F2 camera Mr Mosher originally said he bought the camera for microfilming documents in Hong Kong on April 16 1980 at almost the same time the truck was purchased He said the camera and associated equipment cost 2000 But according to Mr Kennedy Mr Mosher repeatedly refused requests from Stanford to return the camera a requirement under school policy for expensive items bought with grant funds And the presidents letter says that according to Mr Moshers passport he was not in Hong Kong until April 17 and that a handwriting expert identified the sales receipt as having been written by Mr Mosher himself Mr Mosher has since said the original receipt was lost in a move and that he made up a new one to satisfy school policy MrKennedy said that incidents like this showed an extreme lack of candor and truthfulness and eroded the necessary relationship of trust between faculty and student The faculty had been especially disturbed when Mr Mosher who was supposed to be writing his doctoral dissertation about a fishing village in Taiwan unexpectedly submitted parts of a new thesis about rural life in mainland China Mr Kennedy said Character at Issue Mr Kennedy seemed to stress Mr Moshers character more than any of the specific charges made against him in China in upholding his dismissal The letter shows that Stanford did not conclude the validity of several of the initial charges About the object Mr Kennedy said the sales documents supplied by Miss So showed it was bought on April 18 1980 when Mr Mosher but not Miss So was in Hong Kong A detective agency located the employee who made the sale Mr Kennedy wrote and he recalled that it was bought by a Western man who was lefthanded accompanied by a Chinese woman Mr Mosher is lefthanded Mr Kennedy noted While Mr Kennedy did not identify what was purchased he wrote that a Chinese official Zhao Fusan in a letter of complaint to Stanford had described the object The only object described in Mr Zhaos letter is a twoandahalfton truck Bob Beyers a spokesman for Stanford said he had no comment on whether the object was a truck But a professor at Stanford who asked not to be identified said it was a truck It was unclear from Mr Kennedys letter why Mr Mosher would have given the truck to the village But Mr Kennedy did quote from a letter from Mr Mosher to one of his faculty advisers in which he spoke of a mutually beneficial relationship with a local Chinese official and suggested he might invest in a textile factory

IT NEVER WAS EASY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/06/books/it-never-was-easy.html,IN THE COMPANY OF EDUCATED WOMEN A History of Women and Higher Education in America By Barbara Miller Solomon Illustrated 298 pp New Haven Yale University Press 25 WOMEN IN COLLEGE Shaping New Feminine Identities By Mirra Komarovsky 355 pp New York Basic Books 1995 IT will come as news to almost no one that women seeking higher education in the 19th century faced barriers nor will anyone be startled to hear that todays college women have problems of their own But what some people may not realize is the cyclical nature of womens progress in education and the surprising similarity between the concerns of todays students and those of their counterparts in the last century Barbara Miller Solomons In the Company of Educated Women draws on diaries college bulletins newspapers and other secondary materials to chronicle the experience of women in higher education since the beginning of the 19th century In Women in College Mirra Komarovsky a professor emeritus of sociology at Barnard College focuses on changing attitudes toward work family and men among members of the class that entered Barnard in 1979 The resemblance between the books is the preoccupation in all eras with the relationship among college marriage and career As Barbara Solomon who teaches history and literature at Harvard University shows through lively anecdote and skillful analysis college women in any decade could be counted on to mirror the conventions of their times While todays college administrators may be exhausted by demands for such services as abortion counseling for pregnant students imagine the president of Smith College in 1890 publicly explaining the scandalous behavior of students who had dared to perform the forbidden waltz Dancing as a form of dissent was followed by drinking then smoking then sex which took a long time to move from the back seat of an automobile to coeducational dormitories and drugs Barbara Solomon contrasts the eras in which women could claim real progress with those in which women were denied entrance to college and to careers Between 1860 and 1880 women actively participated in the fashioning of their colleges overcoming the objections of such figures as Edward Clarke a prominent Harvard physician who argued that college was bad for womens health and would affect their fertility Between 1892 and 1902 female undergraduates at the University of Chicago increased from 24 to 52 percent of the total student population In that decade 56 percent of those elected to the universitys Phi Beta Kappa chapter were women a fact that did not please the president William R Harper The author reports similar accomplishments at other institutions throughout the country As she observes educators believed that women either drove men out of the classroom or they attracted them into it and then distracted them too much Something had to be done At Chicago separate classes were established for women whenever possible  a policy promptly adopted by many other universities Some colleges such as Wesleyan simply closed their doors to women In the aftermath of World War I new opportunities opened up for women in education The percentage of women on college faculties for example grew dramatically In the 1920s women began to question the assumption that marriage and career were incompatible The norm for college graduates  including women  was employment and serious public debate ensued about the expectation that women would quit their jobs upon marriage A combination of marriage and career at least until motherhood won out but only temporarily Between 1949 and the mid50s when postWorld War II affluence went hand in hand with the sanctity of the nuclear family women lost a good deal of the ground they had gained In 1950 women constituted only 31 percent of the undergraduate population in the country And the president of Radcliffe College promised several consecutive entering classes that their liberal arts education was the best possible preparation for careers as wives and mothers In this context the impact of the womens movement on higher education becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader Mirra Komarovsky describes how college life is perceived by women entering college a decade after the founding of the National Organization for Women and 15 years after the publication of The Feminine Mystique Mirra Komarovsky explored the attitudes of 232 Barnard students from varied backgrounds through extensive surveys questionnaires and interviews with the class of 1983 Twothirds of the subjects suffered from what the author terms culture shock and no two cases of culture shock were alike The one Hispanic woman assigned to a dormitory floor found herself alienated and confused a liberal Roman Catholic encountered the attitudes of a conservative Catholic a woman from a predominantly Jewish high school felt conspicuous as the only Jew at a party students from high schools emphasizing social prowess were judged either loose or savvy Ideas about virginity femininity sexual preference and study habits all came under scrutiny as students friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose At the center of the authors work is a close and highly informed examination of expectations regarding work and career The results of her inquiries cannot surprise us Seventysix percent of entering female students planned on a career marriage and children By graduation this plan was shared by 85 percent of the class One interesting finding was that the most careerminded students had mothers who worked and enjoyed it or mothers who had not worked and regretted it H ARDER to codify but equally intriguing is Mirra Komarovskys material about relationships between undergraduate men and women While it may not have been easy to be a female undergraduate in 1983 it was arguably just as difficult to be a man This study implies that todays young women want in men a rare combination of masculinity sensitivity and selfawareness Young women are often caught between their eagerness for autonomy and their socialization for dependence Reactions to sexual experiences are ambivalent and expressions of sexual interest by men are alternately viewed as offensive or insufficiently serious Despite adequate opportunities to interact with men from a wide range of backgrounds most of the women questioned found it difficult to establish satisfactory relationships Both authors conclude with caveats for those concerned about women and higher education Barbara Solomon counsels us to consolidate our accomplishments and to press on mindful of the ease with which opinions can reverse and options be removed as in the past And Mirra Komarovsky observes that while attitudes have changed institutions have not The gains of the last decade she warns will only be secure when society develops permanent measures to support women in the workplace as well as in the home

THE MIND OF THE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/06/magazine/the-mind-of-the-president.html,RONALD REAGAN IS unique in the history of American Presidents He is alone in possessing the mind of both an ideologue and a politician He has all the moral force and power that swell from absolute conviction His rhetorical lightning bolts about what is good and evil seem to set him apart from the world of waffling politicians Yet unlike other true believers who have ascended the national stage like a Barry Goldwater or a William Jennings Bryan  he is a natural horsetrader often compromising his positions to move toward his political ends Somehow this contradictory cast of mind works for Ronald Reagan In political terms he has been an extraordinary success His popularity remains astronomical For all of his compromises he still manages to look like a man of unbending principle He has seen many of his ideas translated into legislation and helped move the national agenda in his direction  toward the right Yet the Presidents commitment to his principles has led him to take extraordinary controversial actions such as running up unprecedented budget deficits and igniting new military competition with the Soviet Union in space Critics and even members of his own staff question just how deeply he understands the issues in these and other areas They worry about his frequent carelessness with the facts How can one understand the mind of Ronald Reagan That was the central question posed in dozens of interviews with President Reagans past and present aides with his adversaries and during an hourlong interview with the President himself They were also asked how he goes about making decisions his sense of history his system for getting information the roles played by his wife and his aides What emerged was a rich provocative and sometimes contradictory portrait Not one of the friends and aides interviewed for example suggested that the President was in any conventional sense analytical intellectually curious or wellinformed  even though it would have been easy and natural for them to say so They clearly did not think it necessary Time and again they painted a picture of a man who had serious intellectual shortcomings but was a political heavyweight a leader whose instincts and intuition were right more often than their own analyses His mind they said is shaped almost entirely by his own personal history not by pondering on history books  he thinks anecdotally not analytically The Presidents mind they suggested turns on two philosophical poles truth and necessity To him truths are simple and he knows them He may momentarily yield if he feels he has no choice politically but he almost invariably keeps coming back to his principles And he is toughminded and stubborn about it No sooner does he compromise as he did in 1981 approving a tax measure that had fewer breaks for business than he wanted than he reaffirms his goal slashing Government regulation of business He is a sincere believer his aides say but they also depict him as a man who is quite capable of sophisticated maneuvering that includes the usual kinds of political deception These are the keys to Ronald Reagans thinking  and to his political success as head of the Screen Actors Guild as Governor of California and President of the United States His critics have often attributed those successes to his skills as the Great Communicator or to bumbling good luck But the President knows what he is doing when to yield and when to fight and he talked freely about it during an interview in the Oval Office At one point he was asked about criticism of some of the political compromises he has made He said he knew who the critics were Diehard conservatives thought that if I couldnt get everything I asked for I should jump off the cliff with the flag flying  go down in flames No if I can get 70 or 80 percent of what it is Im trying to get yes Ill take that and then continue to try to get the rest in the future And maybe its easier to get it as they see that this works And this was what they were critical of They couldnt stand it that I would compromise and settle for less than Id ask Just within the past month President Reagan has dramatically demonstrated this political flexibility on foreign trade For four and a half years he stoutly resisted protectionist pressures from Congress But with the trade deficit approaching 150 billion for the year and with Congress threatening its own action he shifted ground  seeking subsidies for American exports and driving down the value of the dollar to make American imports dearer and exports cheaper The President was very much in control of the interview during which we were seated sidebyside facing a camera in front of the fireplace Asked why he had been underestimated throughout his political life he lost his smile Turning his head he fixed me with a hard stare as if hitching up his belt for a barroom brawl By whom he wanted to know That toughness natural and purposeful was in evidence every time he felt challenged The polls kind of indicate that the job rating right now is very reassuring he continued Maybe he said people had sometimes underestimated him because of my previous profession as an actor You know it was only a generation ago that actors couldnt be buried in the churchyard The President said what he wanted to say his mind never wavering from that goal He was asked about his sense of history You have to have an historical background for really sane policy decisions he replied Then he told about doing his own research while writing speeches early in his career and that led suddenly to an explanation of how he stopped being a New Deal Democrat when he came to believe that government had grown beyond the consent of the governed and that it was government that was contributing to our economic woes  and incidentally Im not an intellectual but my degree was in economics He was asked to explain some of his contradictory statements and actions He condemned the Panama Canal Treaty before becoming President but has done nothing about it since Well its passed He had called the signed but unratified SALT II Treaty of 1979 fatally flawed but has been informally observing its terms as President I learned that the Soviet Union had a capacity to increase weaponry much faster than the treaty permitted and we didnt What about the huge national debt  it has more than doubled in the five years of his Administration  in light of his promise to eliminate deficits They arent quite as far out of line if you take them as a percentage of gross national product It was an interview with a man who had a clear idea of what he wanted to accomplish and how to go about it Yet according to his friends and aides he can be complex opaque They had trouble explaining his occasional moral obtuseness as in his statement that the German soldiers buried in the cemetery at Bitburg were victims of Nazism    victims just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps Faced with a decision he will usually consult with his staff and take their advice but sometimes he suddenly veers off on his own in entirely new untried directions He can be so secretive that his aides could not predict with any confidence what kind of compromises he might make either at the November summit meeting in Geneva with Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev or with Congressional leaders on tax reform and trade In so many ways for good or ill Ronald Reagan is a different kind of President ONE KEY TO PRESIDENT Reagans success is that hes always been underestimated says Michael K Deaver aide to Governor Reagan in California deputy chief of staff in the first Presidential term and a close personal friend of Nancy Reagan It has been said again and again by those who have worked with and against the President but it never seems to sink in The standard line from most academics and commentators is that the President is ignorant dogmatic and lucky  very lucky  and that he gets by on being a nice guy and a master of the media But that ignores eight successful years as Governor four as President and a resounding reelection in 1984 No one is that lucky that nice and that sonorous Time after time during his Presidency Ronald Reagan has demonstrated his unrelenting determination to have his way In the process he may outrage supporters employ sophistry totally reverse his position while all the while denying it Yet he is also capable of making the kind of difficult decisions his recent predecessors in the White House have avoided It is a different cast of mind Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter for example often played at the margins of issues moving incrementally President Nixon withdrew from Vietnam slowly over years and never finished the job President Reagan withdrew American forces from Lebanon in a single stroke President Carter tinkered with the economy President Reagan made bold vast changes Previous Presidents have spent their days reading lengthy position papers meeting with outside experts keeping up to the minute on international developments But President Reagan according to legislators and others who see him privately generally shows little knowledge about most subjects under discussion They say that his participation in discussions is often exhausted after he has read aloud the information his staff has written for him on threebyfive index cards According to a member of the Presidents Commission on Strategic Forces He never participated in meetings beyond what hed been told to say by Bud McFarlane Robert C McFarlane is the Presidents national security adviser He didnt understand what it was we were trying to do with strategic programs and arms control He just understood that what we were recommending was the way to get the MX missile But whatever the President did or did not understand he bought the commissions compromise proposal worked out a deal with Congress and got his missile Controversy has erupted this year over the Presidents words and actions concerning Bitburg and South Africa How was it possible that a President could be so unthoughtful and so illinformed During the course of a European tour the White House announced the President would visit the German military cemetery at Bitburg When it became known that Nazi SS troops were buried there the uproar began According to some of the aides directly involved in the issue virtually all of the Presidents staff recommended that the visit be canceled Nancy Reagan agreed says a senior aide because she felt it was a nowin situation and would ruin the Presidents whole trip to Europe The Presidents comment equating soldiers and Holocaust victims added fuel to the fire But the President was adamant The senior aide quotes the President as telling his staff I dont want you to change anything History will show Im doing the right thing He was going to prove to the German Government that he was a staunch ally and according to several of his aides he predicted that the incident would soon be forgotten Why did he make the victims of Nazism remark Some of his aides suggest that their boss just did not think the issue through and spoke off the top of his head In the interview in the Oval Office he insisted Never would I ever suggest that those other victims were victims in the same sense as the victims of the Holocaust Yet that was in fact the suggestion he had made seeking to justify his visit to the German cemetery In August President Reagan declared that the Government of South Africa had eliminated the segregation that we once had in our own country The statement produced an uproar But the President had made the remark as part of a defense of his firmly held policy at the time that the best means of influencing Pretoria was to avoid public condemnation of the Government there And though he somewhat backed off from his words he was still ambivalent At a press conference the President said he hadnt intended to say what he did and he went on I did know that all the people that have been coming back here have been reporting to me on how widespread was this and Im sorry that I carelessly gave the impression that I believed that it had been totally eliminated There are areas where it hasnt Indeed most areas Not for the first time the President was  after having a factual error pointed out  hanging tough even repeating the original error A willingness to knowingly bend the truth if it serves his cause is part of the political technique of most Presidents President Reagan does not normally get blamed for it But this is the same man who while refusing to publicly name Communist sympathizers before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the 1950s was privately providing the names to the FBI Michael Deaver sees his former boss in somewhat different terms The President has been accused of contradicting himself and denies it and he believes his denials He rationalizes them in his own mind When it comes to changing positions he convinces himself that it has to be done in the short term but he keeps his goals These qualities were clearly demonstrated in President Reagans decisions on Lebanon and on the deficit When the President sent the Marines to Lebanon he declared that the viability of that nation was vital to American security Congress went along with the decision When he took the Marines out after 241 Americans were killed by a terrorist bomb and Lebanon lay in chaos he insisted that their mission had been accomplished A senior Administration official explained the Presidents moves this way The statement about getting into Lebanon the importance of Lebanon was made to justify the action He believed in the vitalness of Lebanon because that is what his briefing papers said When it was time to take the Marines out I dont think he believed their job was done as he said publicly He had to put the best face on a bad situation In the end President Reagan decided to cut his losses even though he knew it would be viewed by many as confirming a major policy error Other Presidents have been unwilling to face that consequence Ronald Reagan showed equal boldness when it came to making the decisions that led to the doubling of the Federal deficit According to a senior Administration official the President was well aware that the burgeoning deficit could lead to a severe economic downturn He was also aware that tax cuts and increased military spending two of his most cherished goals  could make it necessary for the Government to borrow more money worsening the deficit But the official says If Reagan has to choose between taxing and borrowing to cut the deficit he believes that borrowing is the lesser of the two evils He also continues to believe that his tax cuts will produce enough economic growth eventually to take care of the deficit Most economic analysts disagree Even his advisers are uncertain feeling less optimistic about the prospects of growth But although his staff has great influence with him on most matters Ronald Reagan thinks like a gambler when it comes to the big issues He trusts his instinct and so far it has paid off for him ONE OF THE PRESIDENTS real strengths is his inner compass says Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d who served as White House chief of staff in the first term He not only believes certain things strongly but has believed them for a long time Perhaps more than anyone in American politics Ronald Reagan is the embodiment of 20thcentury America  the radio announcer the movie star the television host for General Electrics Death Valley Days It has been an era of communication of symbols makebelieve has become central to our daily lives  more real than reality He got ahead easily and without much apparent pain or effort Selfconfidence and optimism became ingrained in his whole outlook Nothing was impossible for a man born under a lucky star Books never played a major role in his early years The President likes to say as he did in the interview that he is a voracious reader and history buff But neither he nor his friends when asked could think of particular history books he had read or historians he liked Rather it seems the Presidents ideas about the world flow from his life from personal history rather than studies He developed not so much a coherent philosophy as a set of convictions lodged in his mind as maxims From his Biblequoting mother came a kind of fundamentalism He grew up with a strong sense of right and wrong with a view of the world as a battleground of good and evil Mr Reagan believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible says Michael Deaver From his father a downonhisluck New Deal Democrat and from the experience of growing up in a small town in Illinois came his populist instincts including nationalism and antielitism The antielitism emerged as antiintellectualism in attacks on the Northeast establishment and ultimately in speeches denouncing the bureaucrats of Washington There does not seem to be any hint of populist racism in his personal life but he came out against early civilrights legislation and has consistently opposed affirmative action During his presidency of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952 while battling a Communist takeover of the union his nationalism began to encompass a fervid antiCommunism It became almost his entire worldview expressed in tough antiSoviet rhetoric a deep suspicion about negotiating with the Russians and frequent demands for greater and greater American military power Another element became part of Ronald Reagans set of beliefs as he went around the country delivering his famous speech for GE and as Nancy Reagan began to bring bigbusiness executives into their social life He chose to become a Republican He managed to reconcile his new devotion to capitalism with his populism insisting that if the reins of Government were removed business would boom spreading prosperity to all the people Everything locked into place in that GE speech There he spoke of tax reform school prayer the dangers of appeasing the Russians Above all he called for getting the Government off the backs of the people and of business By the time he became Governor of California in 1967 Ronald Reagans ideas were fully formed In fact Michael Deaver could recall only two instances when his boss agonized over a decision As Governor he had to take a stand on abortion and he had never really thought that out before Mr Deaver says So he talked to lawyers and doctors and came to the opinion that a fetus was a human being Then he held to this view from then on Capital punishment was the second instance He was the first governor to put anyone to death in eight or nine years Mr Deaver says He had his minister fly up to Sacramento and talked for a couple of hours in 1967 Then he went ahead with the execution Since those days Mr Deaver says He has seldom admitted changing his mind on anything I cant think of an instance And that view was echoed by Mr Reagan himself when he was asked whether he had changed his mind or learned anything as President He responded Im continuing the same thing that we did in California namely to reduce the size of government R ONALD REAGANS old friends and aides believe that once he became Governor he made certain assumptions about his future If he just stuck to his fixed ideas and never budged he would end up being a oneterm Governor or possibly a Senator The public had rarely elected ideologues to executive positions  and never to the Presidency The first order of business was to find a staff that could both stand up for the truth and bend to necessity The people around him in California and later in Washington have always included both ideologues to vouch for his continuing ideological purity and conservative pragmatists to get the job done What happens if the two groups clash Says Mr Deaver He appreciates that he needs expediters and technicians who get the best deal for him When theres a conflict of the people around him he opts for keeping the pragmatists The Governors office and the White House staff became bargaining machines  not eager to compromise but willing According to a former top White House official House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr always says that the problem of compromising with the President is that every time you compromise Reagan gets 80 percent of what he wants Actually the former official continued hell take 40 percent and call it 80 Meanwhile throughout the process the President denies that he is a politician even to his staff He is a far cry from Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson who were forever bragging to their aides about how clever or cynical they were During the interview without being asked the President told of a speech he gave his staff after he became Governor I told them that the one thing I did not want to hear was the political ramifications of any issue I wanted only to hear debate on what was good or bad for the people because the minute you start thinking about votes and political things its a bit like seeing a players card you cant take out of your mind that you know where that card is no matter how honest you want to be President Reagan may believe every word of it but at the same time some of his aides see it as part of his conscious political technique He once described to me how he got into politics by accident says a former senior Administration official He told me he told someone By God what am I doing in politics The kinds of things Ive done so far are far away from this But then I thought that a substantial part of the political thing is acting and role playing and I know how to do that So I used to worry but I dont anymore  I N GENERAL SAYS former Senator Howard H Baker Jr The President is easy to predict And virtually all of the Presidents aides and friends agreed that with some important exceptions if you know his basic positions you know what decisions he will make Hes extraordinarily analytical to test the options against his philosophy says a senior aide The President puts his mind to the big picture The details he leaves to his aides giving them power that is unprecedented among modern Presidencies Says a senior White House aide The President is not terribly interested in the process and for a long time I wasnt sure he knew what I did Hes comfortable letting advisers come to him and tell him the issues and options and then hell use his anecdotes These are the maxims some of his aides call them parables  that seem to be central to the way the Presidents mind works Often it is not the logic of an argument that he remembers or calls upon but a circumstance or story that connects the issue at hand to his set of basic principles And these anecdotes his staff says are often the last word on a matter the staff is expected to go forth and carry out the bosss wishes The Presidents experience at the Screen Actors Guild for example may be cited when the subject is negotiation with the Russians the message being dont trust Communists Or when his aides talk to him about the deficit he often recalls that President Kennedys tax cut stimulated the economy the message being stand fast against tax increases In fact logical arguments do not always sway President Reagan As a former adviser puts it If I told him something was probable or improbable that might not be persuasive because his life has been full of improbables that worked out It worked for him to be optimistic against long odds By all accounts his aides feel free to debate openly in front of the President short of directly challenging his basic beliefs They say he is a good listener At most meetings though the President sits quietly If he offers an opinion he seldom sets forth his underlying reasoning Often he keeps his own counsel entirely Sometimes the President will stake out a new position on his own  with little input from his aides or even in the face of their opposition This was the case with his idea for the Strategic Defense Initiative After a few casual conversations on the subject with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others he informed his aides that he wanted them to prepare a speech for him outlining a bold new spaceoriented missile defense system Many staff members disagreed with the scope of his plan as did most military experts and members of Congress but found themselves yielding in the face of his unbending will The Presidents system for getting information is a critical factor in his decisionmaking According to his aides he relies primarily on staff memos which generally are not detailed analyses The staff also sends him letters that tend to support his beliefs He skims the headlines of several daily newspapers essentially looking for anecdotal material and editorial positions usually not reading the main news stories Friends send along magazine articles mainly from conservative journals such as Human Events and Commentary A recent article in Commentary suggesting that discrimination had been essentially eliminated in South Africa was behind his controversial comment to that effect his aides say Members of the Presidents staff never know just what information the President will remember from his reading or how he may use it Reagan has grown up in an intellectual cocoon where he can go from illinformed articles to reasonably conclusive statements says a former White House aide who is now elsewhere in the Administration Other people would normally ask who wrote the article whats his reputation what do others think Reagan will go with a fact or observation without going through a rigorous process A member of the current White House staff describes his mission in these terms You have to treat him as if you were the director and he was the actor and you tell him what to say and what not to say and only then does he say the right thing The Presidents aides frequently refer to his intellectual passivity On domestic issues the leeway given the staff will vary with the subject matter and particular issue On economic questions the President may take an active role  he usually for example goes down the prospective budget giving his decision on each item But on most matters he offers his views and expects aides to find ways to accomplish those ends through legislation the courts or Government regulations On foreign policy issues where the President is less knowledgeable and less confident the staff is generally ceded even greater power In those matters where there is conflict among the aides they tend to come up with a consensus that seldom breaks new ground Among those who have been pushing the President to take a greater role on arms control issues aides say is his wife According to Mr Deaver Nancy Reagan is the most important person in his decisions But on the big issues  like Bitburg taxes defense spending  hes very independent She thinks more about his place in history than the President does He doesnt think about it at all except to say that he wants people to say he did the best he could I NTELLECTUAL CAPA bility Thats the wrong question a former senior economic adviser replied The right question is does he get the right answer In my experience he fails the essay questions but gets the multiple choices Some critics see the President as being simpleminded Rather a number of his aides suggest he is simplistic That is he reduces complications to simple symbols and images of good and bad American and unAmerican That allows him to cut through the complexities that bewilder and hold no interest for the general public putting him squarely on the publics wavelength The Presidents cast of mind and political technique have given him a major hand in reshaping the nations attitudes toward the proper role of government in the economy and the need for greater military spending He has also restored the public confidence that was so shaken by the events in the Administration of his predecessor In fact two aspects of that earlier time  doubledigit inflation with high interest rates and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  gave Ronald Reagan a running start in his effort to win the country to his beliefs Today though he faces a new set of problems with an economy faltering under the weight of budget and trade deficits and the possibility of a new increasingly expensive and fruitless round of arms competition with Moscow How will he respond If past performance is any indication the President will not wait until failure overtakes him If the economy starts to run sharply downhill he will try the other solutions  perhaps even some of those very measures he has so long derided such as increased taxes and decreased military spending He would most likely blame the decisions on everybody else and call them by another name but he would do it The President could count on substantial support from Congress and from some of his key aides if he took such steps On the issue of arms control though a departure from form might run into trouble A number of his key national security aides particuarly those in the Pentagon strongly oppose offering major compromises to Moscow on arms control If an agreement is what the President wants and it seems that it is he would need the cooperation of his whole team and even then he would face hard bargaining with the Russians President Reagans thinking and technique have been enormously successful at the simpler negative tasks of hammering away at big government and rhetorically bashing the Soviet Union These were relatively easy targets a matter of checking the right boxes But looming ahead are some dangerous economic icebergs and an intricate summit meeting in Geneva with the Russian leader  more complex enterprises that will test whether the mind of Ronald Reagan can construct creative political essays
Congress;   Of Women and Women's Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/08/us/congress-of-women-and-women-s-issues.html,After Representative Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio was elected secretary of the Democratic caucus in the House earlier this year she received a call from her predecessor Geraldine A Ferraro Miss Oakar recalled the conversation this way Gerry said Congratulations Now let me tell you what theyll try to do to you Theyll invite you to some meetings and not others  Armed with this warning the new secretary went to Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House and told him she expected to be included in all meetings of the Democratic leadership But the first time there was a White House meeting they invited everyone but me Miss Oakar said A Loud Protest That was the last time Miss Oakar was left out She protested so loudly that the Speaker now takes special care to include her in every leadership meeting Often she is the only woman in the room and her solitary status reminds her of Miss Ferraro who as the Democratic nominee for Vice President last year was the first woman on a national party ticket Each of us has had to break down a barrier Miss Oakar said At the age of 45 Miss Oakar is now in her fifth term in Congress representing a workingclass district that covers parts of Cleveland and its southern suburbs As one who has specialized in the economic problems of women she has been breaking down barriers ever since she got to Capitol Hill and she is now leading the charge against another sizable obstacle to the equality of women The House is scheduled Tuesday to resume consideration of a bill sponsored by Miss Oakar that would mandate a study of gender and racebased discrimination in the giant civil service system The Federal Government ought to serve as a benchmark for how we treat workers across the country said the lawmaker who heads a subcommittee on the Post Office and Civil Service Committee But preliminary studies leave her with few doubts about the presence of discrimination Women employed by the Federal Government she points out average 9000 a year less than male workers There are 15 pay grades in the Federal system but four out of five women are clustered in the seven lowest grades These statistics Miss Oakar says illustrate why older women are so often poor and why feminist groups should concentrate their efforts on issues of economic security Economic security is the truly liberating issue for women the legislator argued If youre economically liberated youre free to pursue other avenues in your life What Miss Oakar refers to as my little bill has stirred fierce opposition in some quarters Conservative Republicans say she really wants to enact the principle of comparable worth under which men and women would be paid equal amounts for similar jobs as determined by some sort of government panel Representative Dick Armey a firstterm Republican from Texas calls the Oakar proposal a dangerous step in the wrong direction away from a freemarket economy The discrepancies between male and female employees he says can be explained almost entirely by market circumstances not discrimination Mr Armey a former economics professor says women have generally chosen to enter the work force later than men work fewer years and shorter hours and interrupt their careers more frequently Nobody is holding a gun to the heads of American women he said They are making free choices In response Miss Oakar says Mr Armey and other opponents are taking a very sexist attitude and displaying a beyond the fringe mentality In her view her foes are the same conservatives who favored dumping Margaret M Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services are soft on apartheid and see pornography in federally supported arts projects In the last Congress she says many lawmakers were afraid of the womens vote and adopted pioneering legislation to improve pensions for women and require divorced spouses to pay child support Her own bill for a study of the civil service system passed the House 413 to 6 before it died in the Senate But now she says her foes have been strengthened by the outcome of last years election I think they feel that because the majority of women voted for Ronald Reagan that they dont have to be as concerned about socalled womens issues Miss Oakar said But I think people who feel there is not a womens vote out there are dead wrong Theres an energy out there that these people dont understand The Fractious Issue Abortion One reason that womens organizations have trouble tapping that energy the Ohio Democrat believes is that they have focused too strongly on the fractious issue of abortion Like several other women in Congress who are Roman Catholic Miss Oakar is a strong liberal on most matters but opposes the use of Federal funds to finance abortions As a result Miss Oakar and some of her colleagues are denied campaign help by womens organizations that have established a litmus test on the abortion issue So the lawmaker is starting a political action committee that regardless of their stand on abortion would raise money for women seeking office who are devoted to economic security issues Progress on those economic issues she is convinced depends on the election of more women to Congress There are only 24 women in Congress Miss Oakar noted It seems to me beyond all other issues were obligated to correct inequities toward our own gender No one else is going to do it

SOME LEGALLANDMARKS ARE FACING RECONSTRUCTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/weekinreview/some-legallandmarks-are-facing-reconstruction.html,The Supreme Court began its new term last week facing among other contentious issues abortion and religion affirmative action and the most determined Administration effort in decades to change the course of constitutional law While calling for an end to judicial activism an activist Justice Department and an outspoken Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d are laying the groundwork to undo much of what the Court has done in the last 30 years In a case involving restrictions on abortion in Pennsylvania and Illinois the Administration has filed a brief urging the Court to overrule its 1973 decision legalizing abortion It has also called on the Justices to back away from their qualified support for raceconscious affirmative action As for church and state Mr Meese has strongly criticized rulings this year enforcing strict separation He has denounced as well other decisions considered landmarks in civil liberties such as the 1966 Miranda ruling which requires police to tell suspects of their rights to remain silent and consult a lawyer At the same time the Administration is making good on the suggestion by former Attorney General William French Smith in 1981 that new appointees to the judiciary would be attuned to the groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election President Reagan has so far appointed more than 200 Federal judges and by 1989 he may have filled more than half the 729 Federal distrtict and appellate judgeships Last week it was reported that he would name James Buckley the conservative former Republican Senator from New York to a Federal appeals court in Washington rather than one in Manhattan where there has been substantial opposition As for the High Court five of the nine Justices will be 77 or older by January Most lists of prospective nominees circulating in the Administration include the names of Robert H Bork Antonin Scalia and Richard A Posner all conservative legal theorists committed to freemarket economics Mr Reagan has put them on Federal appeals courts the first two in Washington and Judge Posner in Chicago But a key question remains Would a Supreme Court dominated by Reagan nominees practice the kind of judicial restraint the Administration has been preaching A traditional ingredient of judicial restraint is respect for precedent Mr Meese has not only assailed relatively recent decisions He has questioned as constitutionally suspect a 60year line of decisions holding that most provisions of the Bill of Rights protect citizens against encroachments by state as well as Federal officials Sweeping attacks on settled law have an activist tinge But most experts agree that judicial restraint does not require utter obedience As Judge Posner wrote in a recent book if liberals were free to be judicial pioneers and conservatives were obliged to follow precedent slavishly the law would move inexorably leftward The essence of judicial restraint say experts like Judge Bork is also deference to policy choices of elected officials except where they conflict with the Constitutions language or reasonably unambiguous design Mr Meese has stressed the need for judges to adhere to the original intentions of the framers and uphold actions not in violation of them Yesterday Justice William J Brennan Jr called this school of thought an effort to express in ostensibly apolitical guise a political antipathy to claims of the minority to rights against the majority A Nice Conjunction Appeals to restraint dovetail nicely with some of the Administrations policy objectives and with the Presidents personal views For example some liberal scholars such as Archibald Cox professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and John Hart Ely Dean of Stanford Law School agree that it was unwarranted judicial activism for the Court to strike down state abortion laws A right to abortion was nowhere mentioned in the Constitution they note and the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment apparently did not think they were creating one The Presidents opposition to abortion was demonstrated again last week when he invoked the cause of restoring the rights of the unborn in a eulogy written for the burial of 16433 aborted fetuses in Los Angeles But in pushing to ban affirmative action plans that benefit blacks at the expense of whites as it has in pending Supreme Court cases involving teachers in Flint Mich firefighters in Cleveland and a New YorkNew Jersey sheet metal workers union the Administration has urged the Court to declare unconstitutional the efforts of local officials around the country to make up for past discrimination And in a case heard last week involving Indiana state legislative districts the Republican National Committee has filed a friendofthecourt brief urging the Justices to declare partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional Republicans hope such a decision would counteract the Democratic domination of most state legislatures and help win control of the House of Representatives The call for what would amount to the most activist intervention in the political process in American history with judges supervising the legislative redistricting process everywhere is in contrast to the pledge in the 1984 Republican Platform to promote judicial restraint Some conservative theorists want the courts to strike down legislatively enacted economic regulations and write freemarket theory into the Constitution While Judges Bork and Scalia have disavowed such activist intentions each has also termed much modern regulatory legislation an obstacle to economic efficiencyMany conservatives who have been criticizing the courts in recent years Judge Scalia has written must decide whether they really believe as they have been saying that the courts are doing too much or whether they are actually nursing only the less principled grievance that the courts have not been doing what they want
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/magazine/no-headline-068579.html,ON FEB 6 1934 MY uncle Andre Monestier joined my father and 40000 other Frenchmen at the barricades to preserve the honor of France and overthrow a government which they thought inept and corrupt Like most other patriots of their time they looked on their nation as supreme unto all others in the glory of its culture and its political and military might Mother of arms of arts and of laws a phrase drummed into them since infancy And in the winter of 1934 that image was being sullied by a number of political scandals which had culminated in the Stavisky affair a heist brought off by a foreign adventurer who had robbed France of billions of francs implicating some of the countrys most prominent men At the cost of several dead and many wounded most of the militants confronted the police at the Pont de la Concorde near the Chamber of Deputies and forced the resignation of the Daladier Government My uncle and father however belonged to a quixotic rightwing organization called Croix de Feu Fiery Cross which had decided to avoid all physical violence They remained in front of the restaurant Lasserre just off the ChampsElysees and were satisfied to tear out the metal pickets that surrounded Lasserres lawn brandishing them as symbolic weapons When policemen asked them the purpose of this singular gathering my two relatives cried out We are here to shout subversive words We are shouting Vive la France  Vive la France subversive words my uncle repeated with relish as he related the incident to me this past summer Ive always been proud of that answer one barely hears those words anymore    We were seated on the terrace at La Croze his summer property in the Gorges du Tarn a savage mountainous site in southern France where Ive been visiting him since early childhood My uncle Andre now 90 years old is the only relative I have left who has witnessed the changes that have swept France in our century And I had returned this time to gauge the shifts in Frances national consciousness by immersing myself in his quintessentially French family Six foot two and massively built my uncle is as lucid vigorous and idealistic as ever He was born in this very region the Lozere and traces his ancestry to 13thcentury Albigensian dissenters who were forced to flee their ancestral village of Monestier close to Albi a map appears opposite page And earlier that day Id teased him with the notion that he had been made a true patriot by his more heretical traits  Utopian optimism audacity rebelliousness Right hed quickly answered too much passivity these days people are always waiting for a leader    never wait just vote for the least imbecile of the lot and continue griping and create whatever microcosm of perfection you can in your own life    Below us as poplars gleamed on the sunny bank a large wooden crate strung on cables was slowly traveling above the river Tarn carrying Le Figaro and a load of groceries from the nearby village My uncles summer reteat which he bought in 1935 had struck me since childhood as a microcosm of romantic perfection La Croze is a complex of rustic gray stone buildings that can only be reached by boat perched on that steep rocky side of the Tarn canyon on which there is no road for many miles And the region itself the Lozere is one of Frances most untamed close to where the Wild Boy of Aveyron is said to have been raised by wolves the only part of the country in which wolves are said occasionally still to roam The age of leaders may be over my uncle was saying It already was over in 1914 Do you realize that World War I was the first major war in history which did not bring forth one great man Not one military genius Led by total dunces who wasted men left and right I was there in the Somme    I HAD ORIGINALLY STARTED visiting La Croze because Uncle Andres wife Aunt Simone was a cousin of my fathers and the three had become inseparable by the time I was born They shared interests in philosophy maverick politics and exotic places thought bizarre by their conventional provincial relatives After being wounded and highly decorated in World War I Uncle Andre had graduated from a competitive grande ecole  Polytechnique He had settled in the Paris region and with a fairly modest capital investment the equivalent of 6000 in 1985  he had started a small chemical factory that provided him with a comfortable living for some decades Every few winters he and my aunt set out on audacious trips considered outlandish by habitually cautious French travelers  they descended the Amazon into the wilds of Brazil skied in the Carpathians sailed through the Norwegian fjords Aunt Simone was an indefatigable highspirited redhead with a vigorous need to nurture shelter spread cheer The Monestiers had yearned for 10 children but had never been able to bear more than one daughter Claude a decade my senior During my summer vacations at their eccentric hamlet La Croze they treated me as a second child putting me to bed in their own room when the house was overcrowded with guests Their boldness and largess remained unabated with the decades During the years of the Nazi occupation after my father had died with the Free French and I had immigrated to the United States the Monestiers repeatedly risked their lives to shelter whatever underground fighters came their way After the liberation my uncle was elected mayor of La Malene the impoverished village closest to La Croze During his decade as mayor he organized the first boatmens union in the region and lobbied relentlessly in Paris to provide his constituents with their first public water system Two decades later when he and Aunt Simone were close to 70 and their own finances were decimated by the forced sale of their chemical factory they persuaded the Alliance Francaise to back their several trips to India where they gave lectures on Teilhard de Chardin They lived in an ashram in Pondicherry for several months of the winter rising at 5 AM to work and pray with the rest of the community And back in Paris my uncle published a book entitled Teilhard or Marx My aunt busied herself with Jungianism and graphology supplementing income by analyzing handwriting samples at 30 a shot By the age of 10 in the middle of the war I had settled in the United States with my mother But the deep love I had for the Monestiers and theirs for me remained undiminished by time or distance After the war returning to France every few years for a summer visit I was increasingly fascinated by their views which were as quirky and original as their avocations Devout Catholics and Gaullists they had come to believe that Communism is a manifestation of the Devil a Satanic event yet they declared themselves to be Christian Socialists because capitalism is based on usury which is forbidden by the Gospel Despite their love of travel and their great admiration for American character and customs they never came to the United States because they judged it to be too similar to France equally part of the materialistic West Radically ecumenical my uncle could write and publish the hazardous opinion that Christ has been present through His Holy Ghost in each religion since the worlds beginnings yet defend every Pope that came to power In the last decade the Monestiers longing for a large family has been amply fulfilled By 1980 the five children of their daughter Claude who had married during the war had given them 21 greatgrandchildren Claudes husband Jean de Laromiguiere had spent two years in Dachau for his work in the Resistance suffered many nervous breakdowns and was frequently absent from home leaving the Monestiers all the more in charge Every summer the entire clan congregated loyally at La Croze which teemed with little ones And as I watched my adopted parents aging amid proliferating youth I feared that I was seeing an aspect of France threatened with extinction They belonged to a generation infused with the unquestioned authority of travail famille patrie yet they also exemplified that spirit of idealism and risk that until World War II had constantly revitalized the nation inspired its mavericks and visionaries from the Curies to de Gaulle from Cousteau to Teilhard Could this balance of rootedness daring and chivalry be maintained by their progeny How did the sense of being French differ in 1985 from what it had been in 1934 when my father and uncle took to the streets to help overthrow a corrupt government What are the French thinking today about such issues as religion family FrenchAmerican relations the threat of Communism the atomic bomb How has Frances traditional sense of superiority been affected by its diminished status as a great power These are some of the questions Id set out to explore as I stood by the Tarn river on a July afternoon this year waiting to be ferried across to La Croze I had driven up from Montpellier some three hours south and parked my car in the family lot that lies below the D907 bis the tortuous public road across the river from La Croze Id given my decadesold shout Traversez and been answered with the traditional On arrive I inhaled the thyme and lavender on the hot air stared at the gray garland of houses that lies nestled on the rockcrested mountain like a nation unto itself I looked at the site with particular sadness and urgency for my beloved Aunt Simone had died of a heart attack just five weeks before aged 87 And my uncle so Id been told the day before on the phone was in his bed at La Croze suffering from bronchitis and a fever of 102 T WO BIKINICLAD beauties Claudes 14 and 17yearold granddaughters whom I had last seen when they were 6 and 9 pole across the Tarn to fetch me the wooden rods thudding softly against the stony river bed My cousin Claude stands on the other side and runs forward to hug her welcome a large exuberant woman who has inherited her mothers tumultuous vitality and warmth This particular afternoon she wears a greenandwhite Tshirt inscribed with the words TupperwareFrance  the American company for whose Paris branch she has worked for over two decades My uncle she immediately reassures me is improved today and I can see him for a very short visit In residence at La Croze she adds as we climb the steep path to the house are 27 members of the family four of her five children 14 of her grandchildren several cousins Its a great disappointment she says Wed planned to be 35 Missing from the reunion is her husband Jean who is again in crisis Its been a very sad summer she sums up as we reach the house but a wonderfully quiet one Imagine none of us has crossed the river more than once on Sundays to go to mass Oh well the very best times are those when there is a priest vacationing here says one of her granddaughters and then we can spend weeks without crossing except to fetch guests Cest ici quon se ressource gravely adds her 15yearold cousin  Were renewed refueled here And I sense that the mysterious force of tribal roots is exerting itself as fully as ever on the new generation U NCLE ANDRE greets me from his bed a biography of Pope John Paul II in hand effusive and lucid despite his illness Do I notice that hes wearing the red bathrobe Id sent him for Christmas a decade ago which he hasnt gotten out of since No one must worry about this silly fever dont we know what powerful stock he comes from His 92yearold sister the retired nun is playing bridge tournaments in Lyons having lied about her age to get into the tournaments    The room sparsely furnished with rustic chairs and chests of fruitwood left almost cavedark by the narrow 17thcentury windows that pierce the walls of roughhewn stone has barely changed since I slept in it as a child Id been determined to remain stoic about Aunt Simones death but at the sight of the halfempty bed my eyes flood with tears Come come my uncle says gently touching my cheek Its sad but not so sad Whats life but a passage to more important things The faith of the phrase threatens to set me off again so I hasten downstairs to the terrace where the immense family always congregates when it isnt pouring rain the one indoor public room being constantly used as a bedroom by some member of the clan As I join my cousins they are finishing Sunday lunch a frugal Americanstyle meal prescribed long ago by Aunt Simone so that no one would have to cook on the Sabbath a selfservice buffet of hot dogs rolls and red wine a selection of popsicles for dessert After the emotional mayhem of greetings the queries about the health of my family back in the United States the introduction to each child born since my last visit my relatives sink into their chaises relax to take their coffee From now until 5 when everyone will descend to the Tarn for the ritual lateafternoon swim the air hums with the clicking of knitting needles and the snipping of scissors Most of the women are making a garment for another member of the family  evening dress for a 16yearold niece bloomers for a 4yearold nephew  while the rest of us sit on the lawn stringing beans for supper Yves de Laromiguiere Claudes youngest son sits apart with his brothersinlaw and nephews planning next mornings work All the upkeep of the property is done by the men of the family  there is always a leaking roof to be repaired a generator to be serviced brush to be cleared in many fields As the shadows lengthen and everyone prepares for the evening swim a 5yearold passes his cousins and siblings the basket holding the afternoon gouter  dark chocolate nestled in thick chunks of white bread I follow the clan down the steep path to the Tarn and we all wade into midriver to a small pebbly island some 20 feet wide and 40 feet long that I find strikingly uncomfortable and claustrophobic The family favors it because it offers shallow water on one side for the little ones more adventurous depths on the other side for the adults They remain there until close to suppertime and continue the family banter started over lunch twodozen relatives supremely content with each other seeking out for the evening hours an enclave even more intimate and crowded than the one they have spent the day in As I watch this tribal spectacle it strikes me that they might be recreating in these compulsive yearly gatherings a microFrance of bygone years indulging in a nostalgic fantasy of that superior united selfsufficient nation that their patriarch had already battled to preserve a halfcentury ago Of the adults gathered on that crowded island I have chosen six who might express how that sense of France has changed Chantal de Bussac Claudes secondoldest daughter a very handsome outgoing woman of 42 has amply inherited her grandparents forthright warmth and intellectual gifts Before her marriage she taught mathematics and physics to the senior class of a girls school in Paris For the last 14 years she has lived in ClermontFerrand her husbands native city which she prefers to the capital because it provides better quality of life for the children Soon after the last of her four offspring was born she began to feel restless and became interested in the theories of personality development formed in the United States by the psychologist and author Carl Rogers For two years she spent part of each week in Lyons leaving her husband in charge of the children learning la methode Rogers Using its techniques of consciousnessraising she now runs group seminars in which she teaches women to fulfill their identities express themselves more eloquently abolish their sense of powerlessness Although Chantal is still uncomfortable with the feminist label she admits that her work involves a quintessence of nonconfrontational feminism She has also been active in a nationwide organization Accueils des Villes Francaises which helps women adapt to their surroundings when they move to a new city Chantal feels that a recent blossoming of volunteer organizations is one of the most striking developments in contemporary France and that it has to do with a great loss of faith in the state as an agent of change She heartily welcomes this new publicmindedness Were at last crawling out of our traditional shell the home and reaching out to others The de Bussacs also do a great amount of volunteer work for their parish including a weekly counseling session for couples who are about to be married Can you imagine some of them tell us theyve already been living together    that would have sounded very startling 10 years ago Pierre de Bussac Chantals husband is the most cosmopolitan of my cousins A slight pensive man approaching 50 he is a graduate of a competitive grande ecole  Ecole des Mines He spent a year in the Soviet Union in the 1960s overseeing the installation of French machinery in Soviet chemical plants He speaks and writes Russian fluently and speaks English well though he is very shy about using it After a stint with the American firm Armco he now directs a small company that makes computer printout paper in ClermontFerrand Etre Francais cest etre contre Pierre says  To be French is to be against But he senses that his compatriots are dissatisfied with a larger variety of issues than ever before and that they are engaging in an unprecedented amount of selfcriticism Pierres particular obsession is the downright pathetic state of Frances scientific research which lacks any systematic or adequate funding Americans might seem overly specialized to us but youre the ones getting the Nobels Pierre feels that the French are undergoing a crisis of identity that was originally triggered by the student uprisings of 1968 when all forms of traditional authority were put into question Like every member of the MonestierLaromiguiere clan he is militantly opposed to Mitterrands Socialist Government and to all forms of leftism Yet he does not totally share his inlaws condemnatory views of the 1968 rebellion and believes it was a great benefit to French family structure It made better parents of us it finally taught us to listen to childrens opinions as the most interesting and precious we can hear it transformed the table talk of French families    it is at table that everything happens In Clermont Pierres favorite recreation is to see American films particularly those of Woody Allen He dismisses all allegations of American cultural imperialism abroad as more misguided leftist nonsense He believes that French culture needs to turn outward in every possible way and would benefit by emulating American models of business management scientific research and philanthropic funding Catherine de Maistre Chantals younger sister is a delicate elegant woman with a striking resemblance to the young Zizi Jeanmaire Her sinuous feline charm is illmatched to her grimly disciplinarian views During a short walk we took together she said that 1968 was a watershed year for me because I was in the last year of school and my brother Bruno and I were tempted to join our classmates and go to some demonstrations But mother put her foot down and said Ive worked my heart out to support you dont you dare go out there or you cant come home It was blackmail on her part virtual blackmail but Ive always been grateful to her for it    She taught us then and there the supremacy of family duty and patriotic values of order order above all    and Ive tried to instill the same values in my children For a decade Catherine had fervently hoped to bear a son who might continue her husbands illustrious name Alain de Maistre is a direct male descendant of Joseph de Maistre c17531821 the prominent archconservative thinker whose writings opposed les philosophes of the Enlightenment deplored the progress of science and acclaimed public executioners as the guardians of social order Catherine and Alain bore four daughters in a row and a few years ago rejoiced at the birth of their first son The de Maistres shun their local parish in fashionable Neuilly because it is close to being Communist and travel a distance to attend mass at which they listen to marvelously oldfashioned authoritarian sermons which hold even the youngest children spellbound Catherine has recently stopped reading Elle magazine because of its support of legalized abortion and switched her loyalties to Madame Figaro which she consders the most BCBG  bon chic bon genre  publication in France Catherine says she would be deeply shocked if one of her daughters admitted to having sex before marriage Like her sister Chantal and her brother Bruno Catherine came to spend some weeks with me in the United States in the mid1960s She was overwhelmed by Americans hospitality and warmth And notwithstanding her qualms about the permissiveness of our mores one intake of marijuana in school and you get hooked for life on stronger stuff like cocaine and heroin she wishes fervently that each of her children might enjoy a similar stay in the States when they come of age Alain de Maistre lanky 6 foot 2 did his military service in Frances most elite paratroop corps stayed on a few extra years and almost decided to make a career of it He is the director of an advertising agency that handles financial accounts including that of the Banque Nationale de Paris He is more publicly active than his homeloving wife and his great cause is the Boy Scout movement He recently spent seven years as Scoutmaster giving the movement a dozen hours a week He trained for the paratroop corps in several different countries and the happiest times of all were spent in Germany the country for which his generation and that of his children feel the most sympathy I found no difference whatsoever in human values in any point of view between our group and our German colleagues The most unhappy days of Alains paratrooper training were spent in England which my cousins unanimously agree is that country in the world which the French dislike the most The British forced our unit into total isolation The British will never become Europeans theyll always remain insular a culture of their own Like every one of my relatives Alain and Catherine have intense admiration for Ronald Reagan as they had for Richard Nixon How lucky you are to still have such great leaders Magnificent men Alain says that he inherited a negative view of the United States and only began to admire it in his late teens when his Scout troop was taken to the World War II museum in Normandy I learned there to my total amazement that the US forces had participated in the liberation of France  in all our history courses we were taught that the Free French alone had liberated the country Yves de Laromiguiere Claudes fifth and youngest child is the familys political activist For the first five years of his marriage he lived near Amiens where he ran for the Chamber of Deputies on Valery Giscard dEstaings ticket He is tall and heavyset like his grandfather with a ready smile and a voluble gift for conversation He now lives in Brussels where he directs the Belgian branch of a French wallpaper concern One of Yves favorite political topics is the need for a united European community France cant go it alone any more than Great Britain or Italy can If we dont destroy our outdated boundaries and create Europe the decline of Western civilization will be as total as that of Egypt or other ancient cultures The first step is to create one single European monetary unit but like other tasks in building Europe it cant be done through the political system The notion of abandoning French currency is an abomination for the average French deputy and his constituents So we have to lobby for it create a massive grassroots movement which will impose the notion on our politicians The situation is already serious dangerous Europe is becoming poorer by the day    Yves enjoys Brussels because its marvelous to live in a country which has no complex of superiority He looks upon that particular trait of his countrymen as an escapist delusion kept alive for too many decades by de Gaulle and not yet eroded enough His devout Catholicism is an interesting mixture of liberal and conservative He shares his grandfathers belief in the equal sanctity of all religions and finds it abominable that the Church of Rome still retains the word Catholic in the Nicene Creed One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church The word Catholic should immediately be dropped to make a statement of universal salvation Yves says Yet like most every member of the family he and his wife go to confession once a month And last fall the couple accompanied Yves mother Claude on a pilgrimage to a site in Yugoslavia where the Virgin Mary is said to be appearing daily to six young peasants As with the rest of his kin the central priority of Yves life is his childrens education He is very critical of both the Belgian and the French educational system They cram you with facts and dont teach you how to use them he says So notwithstanding his profound dislike of the British Yves is sending his oldest son Louis 9 to a Jesuit boarding school in England During one of our lunch conversations Yves said that if he were doomed with some illness and had only a few months to live he would spend all his time writing letters to each of his four children a fundamental letter for each year of their growing up until they reach the age of 21 Every member of the assembled family enthusiastically agreed that they could not conceive of a better way to spend their last days on earth What do you think of Allen Ginsbergs Howl  Yves wife Sybille asked me in her nearperfect English on one of my mornings at La Croze She is a seductive greeneyed redhead with a spunky sense of humor and has graduate degrees in British and American literature from the University of Amiens She taught her subject in a private school while bringing up four children Her reading in contemporary American literature which seems to go up to 1960 includes Henry Miller Arthur Miller and Truman Capote She yearns to return to the United States where she once spent a summer on Long Island Unlike my other relatives Sybille thinks it wrong for Catholics to impose their views against abortion on the population at large and is opposed to the growing movement to repeal legal abortion in France Sybille is militant however on the issue of preserving the freedom of private church schools She and Yves traveled from Brussels twice in 1984 to attend rallies protesting government legislation that threatened to curtail that freedom and which drew unprecedented crowds of a million and a half people Sybille is also adamant on the issue of premarital sex Im particularly disturbed when unmarried teachers have sex together Il faut avant tout ne pas choquer  Above all one must never shock B OTH THE AMERICAN television imports Dallas and Dynasty are unanimously shunned and derided by the family Cest pour les ploucs  Its for the simpleminded and the children are forbidden to view them because of their low moral caliber My relatives have not read or seen and have barely heard of Roland Barthes Jacques Derrida Marcel Ophuls Marguerite Duras or most other persons who have recently served as cultural bridges between France and the United States Being little aware of discussions about the mediocrity of current French culture and its consequent colonization by foreign talent they are indifferent to the fact that a ChineseAmerican architect is about to build a pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre that an Italian has been commissioned to design the interior of the new Quai dOrsay museum and that a Canadian architect is designing the new opera house at the Place de la Bastille My relatives names sound ancient and romantic but their means are modest and their talk seems totally centered on Confucian concerns for family and on issues of immediate survival  how best to take care of grandfather Monestier now that he is widowed the threat posed to Pierre de Bussacs business where production has been cut by 30 percent because of several strikes by the CGT Frances largest union the precarious finances of Yves older brother Bruno who must support six children on the meager salary he earns from an American automotive company whose French branch has fallen on bad times how to pool the money direly needed to maintain La Croze the upkeep of which they finance jointly Along with their obsession with the childrens education they are above all immersed in the cultivation of harmonious family bonds their concept of self seems virtually nonexistent outside of the communal context of their extended family These dutiful cautious lives may strike Americans as constrained classconscious traditionbound Yet one cannot help but admire the remarkable cordiality tenderness and deference that is maintained between siblings and cousins parents and children and most striking of all between husbands and wives It is a family in which women have considerable influence and power and often express themselves in strong language as they did on a recent summer afternoon A young married couple only vague acquaintances had waded across the Tarn for a visit The aggressive loquacious husband sat by my uncle talking of the abandoned shepherds house he had just bought on one of the neighboring causses the barren stony plateaus that dominate the gorges of the Tarn and of other neighboring rivers He planned to live there with his bride five months of the year He was rebuilding the walls and roofs of the house with his own hands He had just started his own lumber business in the area no more of the capitals metro boulot dodo roughly subway the office grind and off to bed  current shorthand for the hassle of Parisian life And do you have any employment Madame     my uncle courteously asked the waifish very silent young wife Hell no I wouldnt let her the husband interrupted with a lewd wink Whod want a wife whos all tired out at night That man is a walking phallus Sybille exclaimed as soon as the uninvited guests had started wading back to the opposite bank Must be a beast in bed my cousin Claude remarked Odious machismo Catherine added Poor pretty girl my 90yearold uncle said shed be better off with me D U VIN FIN A dejeuner uncle Andre called out from his bedroom as his lunch tray was about to be brought none of our local everyday swill And a poire with my coffee By the third day I was at La Croze my uncles fever had abated and I was able to visit with him for a few hours of the afternoon He sat in his armchair by a window that overlooked the Tarn shoes impeccably shined the Legion of Honor rosette blazing in the lapel of his tweed jacket He had discovered my predilection for serious talk when I was about 6 years old and as in our meetings of past decades he began with a little theme that he wished me to ponder This time it had to do with the 20th century as analogous to the Book of Job It is simply not normal he began for God to send us as many plagues as he has since 1914 At just about that time as I see it God and the Devil had one of their big executive meetings and the Devil said You think theyre worthy down there Lets test them out with some real trouble and well find out And sure enough the Lord sent all those plagues to test our faith the decimation of World War I Hitler Stalin    My heretic ancestry he pointed his cane toward the windows and mountains Youve always thought thats my source    Well I do grow increasingly Manichaean as I get older I sense that a force of Evil has been pitted against Good since the Creation And in 1985 God sits up there still challenged by the Devil pretending Hes dead pretending Hes abandoned us testing us testing    He paced the room slowly his eyes benign under the bushy black brows even when he wished to look threatening Well we deserve His abandonment we asked for it Pope John Paul put it best Christians have failed the Gospel capitalism is totally unjust toward the working class But we might just be able to come out of it I feel were at the end of the Great Temptation Mind my words the 21st Century will be the spiritual century or it will not be at all    It had been two hours since the younger generations had been in the patriarchs room They had been admonished to respect his afternoon rest Now they started crowding in as they do every midafternoon bringing their hugs and kisses their presents of butterflies and leaves their admonitions to him to avoid courants dair and to move about less Tea was brought in and somehow we all fell to talking about heroes Which public figures did we particularly admire or uphold as heroes either past or present Dear God all the heroes I was brought up to revere as a schoolboy uncle Andre exclaimed Archetypes of patriotic valor Vercingetorix Roland at the pass Napoleon Later on I also adulated Clemenceau Poincare Teilhard and still later Gandhi the great pacifist Lanza del Vasto    Well those of us who came of age during the last war never admired military men my cousin Claude said My heroes are Renoir and Berthe Morisot those passionate sensual artists who can fill our lives with joy and warm colors Oh Id crawl through the Sahara on all fours to own one    I admire most those who work above and beyond politics said Claudes daughter Chantal Like Mother Teresa John XXIII Catherine said Mozart Bach Chopin said Anne Claudes silent pensive daughter who seldom participates in group conversation I turned to the generation of my uncles greatgrandchildren who were gathered together in the back of the room I balk at the very notion of heroes said 17yearold Arnaud Chantals eldest child Well    perhaps Einstein The only heroes I have are fictional said Cristelle his 17yearold sister like Julien Sorel But why have heroes exclaimed her 17yearold cousin from Tours Valerie Our generation refuses heroes Thats our motto no more heroes Weve all seen the obverse side of the coin we all know the shoddy seamy side of geniuses and public men We dont even have any more leaders she added defiantly Et je trouve ca tres bien  I think its all to the good L OOK MAGIC Claude exclaims lifting up her Tupperware plastic rolling pin for everyone to see Impeccable pie crust in 60 seconds without a moment of sticking And now I transfer my dough into the pie plate    see even the rolling surface is intact Claude joined the Tupperware corporation some two decades ago shortly after it had opened its first office in Paris She was the 11th dealer in France Tupperware of America she exclaims to anyone not acquainted with the company An enterprise of genius branches in 33 countries Today she is giving me a Tupperware demonstration on the terrace of La Croze and a score of her progeny have assembled for the umpteenth time to watch her Heres the secret she continues A hollow plastic rolling pin which we fill with icecold water to avoid any sticking The very way in which Claude joined Tupperware seems providential It was in 1962 and her husband Jean de Laromiguiere had just undergone the second of the major nervous breakdowns that he would suffer after his return from Dachau With five children to support Claudes finances were desperately strained She economized by going to Les Halles at 5 every Thursday morning to do the entire weeks marketing A friendly merchant expressed concern that Claudes groceries might spoil and showed her a streamlined new kind of plastic container which she claimed insured weeklong garden freshness Claude immediately coveted the containers and was dismayed to learn that le Tupperware is sold only en salon  at demonstrations in private homes But the merchant promised to arrange such an event and within a fortnight my cousin was watching a Comtesse de Chambure proprietor of a splendid chateau in the Somme sell several hundred dollars worth of the American miracle in one afternoon Broke and energetic Claude immediately decided to join the circle of Parisian women making independent incomes through the plastic wonder She found her first clientele through her hairdresser who invited Claude to perform in an apartment building of a workingclass suburb All the women there were members of the CP Claude recalls They launched me and I owe them eternal gratitude With the Communist ladies Id doubled my sales quota in a fortnight The secret Communists love presents and Tupperware offers a free gift with each purchase Twenty years later Claude directs a Tupperware concession that covers a few hundred miles miles north and west of Paris and supervises more than 400 sales personnel In the last two decades she has seen the world thanks to Tupperware attending conferences and visiting branch offices in 19 countries including Ireland Senegal Indonesia and the United States where she spends most of her time at the company headquarters in Orlando Fla She speaks no more than a few words of English She admires above all our other institutions Thanksgiving holiday a sign of the profound religiosity of the American people In the 1970s when Claudes deranged husband began to leave home for months at a time she drew strength from still another American import  the speaking in tongues manifestation of the charismatic movement which had recently migrated from United States churches to those of Europe and was making spectacular inroads into French Catholicism It is also called Le Mouvement du Renouveau somewhat analogous to our term born again Claude learned about it from a colleague at Tupperwares office in Nantes and discovered a form of prayer which is all the deeper because it abandons logical linguistic symbols In the last few years this daughter of the country gentry has become one of the charismatics most active street evangelists On Saturday mornings she meets a dozen colleagues in front of a prosperous branch of the Felix Potin grocery chain in Neuilly The group stands on the sidewalk reading and chanting texts to a guitar accompaniment and urging any passerby who approaches them to read and spread the Gospel Claude sees the charismatic movement as one more way in which staid conservative French adults are joining in voluntary organizations taking to the streets to fulfill their needs and aspirations And wait till you see our new Ultra 21 line Claude says as she brandishes a souffle mold at the end of her Tupperware demonstration Tupperware for the 21st century A revolutionary new brand of plastic that can go straight from the freezer into a 350degree oven Formidable Even the athletic teenage grandsons applaud Mother is so persuasive Catherine says proudly She could sell you a bag of rusty nails even if shed told you they were rusty But Claudes oldest daughter 43yearold Anne has knitted dourly throughout the performance her eyes cast down on her clicking needles as she sits through most of her days at La Croze She is a brooding woman with a great gift for music which she was never able to fulfill and a broken marriage And as she angrily knits on the terrace at La Croze I am forced to recall that she is that child of the MonestierLaromiguiere clan most profoundly marked by the traumas of World War II Anne was a year old in 1942 when her mother and father Jean de Laromiguiere a brilliant and eccentric graduate of SaintCyr undertook one of the most perilous tasks of the Resistance they turned their small Paris apartment into a shelter whence Free French and other members of the underground were guided to the Spanish frontier The resisters hiding place was a small bedroom reached through Annes nursery its door hidden by a curtain The Laromiguieress escape network was eventually infiltrated by a Gestapo informer and Jean was sent to Dachau During the following months Claude shifted homes every few days with her tiny daughters Anne and Chantal to avoid her own arrest Anne was 4 when she saw her father return from Dachau a dour silent invalid weighing some 70 pounds He had repeatedly suffered floggings and solitary confinement for agitating in behalf of fellow inmates She was 12 when her father had his first total breakdown For a decade a series of French doctors hardly known for their contribution to the field of mental health tried to cure Jean with a combination of drugs and sleeping cures which entailed being put to sleep for months at a time During one such treatment he fell off his bed while unattended and lay hours on a freezing hospital floor contracting double pneumonia and suffering setbacks of mental illness Lithium drugs were made available in France in the late 1960s and these periodically enabled Jean to resume some kind of family life I saw him at La Croze in 1974 and 1977 Plump and numbed by the drug my once razorwitted cousin spent most of his time wandering about the property keeping company with the youngest of his grandchildren dusting their toys pushing their swings During periods when he refused treatment he would leave home for stretches of up to two years begging hospitality in different provinces from relatives and friends Since his most recent cure he often comes to Paris to lunch with Claude The independence Ive gained through my Tupperware work has given me courage she told me this summer The charismatic movement has strengthened the faith I need to pray for his total healing And you know she adds with her brave luminous smile they both came from the United States HE IS THE CRUCIBLE for our memory That is the phrase with which 17yearold Arnaud de Bussac describes the missing member of the yearly family reunion Jean de Laromiguiere his recurringly ill absent grandfather He has forced us to remember the past to a far greater degree than most of our generation And one must remember in order not to start again it is forgetfulness which could start another war    And yet I note Germany is the country for which he and his relatives feel the most affinity Doesnt his grandfathers suffering begun at Dachau make it particularly difficult for his family to feel close to Germans The first thing grandpapa said when he returned from camp is this says Arnauds 14yearold brother Nicolas We must remember but we must also forgive Anyhow we must all outgrow our sense of national boundaries says Arnaud who is cramming for the admissions examination to his greatgrandfathers school the prestigious Polytechnique and whose words are heeded with reverence by his peers I feel just as European as I feel French There is much more affinity these days between a French and a German than there is between a Breton and Parisian The six youngsters whose ages range from 14 to 17 nod approvingly Arnaud two of his siblings and three of his cousins are dining with me at a small restaurant at La Malene the village a few miles upstream from La Croze In the first halfhour theyve already confronted me with two myths which I destroyed as well as I could One In the States everyone informs you of their annual salary the second they meet you Two Americans publish no news about France whatsoever in their newspapers they dont even bother to study French anymore everyones learning Japanese Id asked them about their future vocations Arnaud is one of Les happy few whose scientific career would be assured by his admission into a grande ecole His sister Cristelle would like to work in the business management of some international couture or perfume industry ideally like Hermes Valerie 17 is studying at the Ecole du Louvre aspires to be an art dealer and detests any art more recent than the Impressionists Nicolas 14 wishes to start his own business enterprise Good luck old man the others jibe at him Its not like the old days when greatgrandfather could set up a factory on a pittance These days the Government stifles all initiative All of these youngsters fear that their schools outdated curriculums and the general rigidity of French society could pose severe obstacles to their goals We cant seem to succeed according to our gifts anymore as you still can in the United States Our country is too withdrawn into itself our economic system seems unable to find any source of renewal Our schools only cram us with facts with which to pass exams we need a more complete formation which would include computer techniques arts sports If they were of age how would they vote to remedy these ills in the legislative elections scheduled for the spring of 1986 They all shrug their shoulders indifferently Raymond Barre seems OK Arnaud says Id vote for the right to be sure Valerie says and probably for JeanMarie Le Pen on the first round as a protest Do they feel threatened by the possibility of an atomic war Were much more afraid of pacifists and demonstrations and protest movements than of the bomb Nicholas says defiantly and the group nods vehemently in assent Their favorite musicians are Michel Sardou Pink Floyd and Simon and Garfunkel The only American actor they care for is Gregory Peck Their favorite French stars are Isabelle Adjani MiouMiou and Marlene Jobert They are in unanimous accord that their parents are absolutely fair and liberal in their ways of imposing discipline and that their private schools most of which are church schools do not give a rigorousenough religious formation And their favorite moments of the year are spent at La Croze where there is nothing much to do beyond engage in family banter do maintenance work on the property take a daily swim in the Tarn and a weekly trip to La Malene to go to mass and enjoy many visits with greatgrandfather Monestier The most extraordinary man well ever know A magnetic force A source of inspiration to each of us It is uniquely serene here at La Croze It is so romantic We are renewed here one of them says as a cousin had said earlier that week They have helped me to learn that of that once sacred triad travail famille patrie famille is the only one that remains undiminished and intact For the sphere of travail has been made more precarious than ever by a society in which social mobility seems not to increase by a Socialist experiment whose vision seems limited whose consensus has failed and whose very future seems uncertain The issue of patrie is being increasingly blurred by the aspirations for a European community by an unprecedented lack of faith in the central government by a cosmopolitanization that is affecting the entire planet but particularly affects the French because their identity so depended on their sense of superiority and uniqueness So amid the tarnished tenuous concepts of work and nationhood the narrow pleasures of family life may provide all the more seductive a refuge for the young I could not perceive one chink in the reverence and admiration my young relatives have for every generation of their family for its authority and rituals Their docility struck me as downright scary M ANY THINGS HAPpen in France at lunchtime if one allows the symbols to take over Uncle Andre had fully recovered from his flu And just before lunch one day he indulged in one of the yearly rituals the bestowing of the Grand Ordre de La Croze It is an honorary society whose ranks from Chevalier to GrandCroix duplicate precisely those of the Legion of Honor It has been awarded for decades by my aunt and uncle to those members of the family who with good humor and diligence as one citation reads have helped us to preserve this privileged site La Croze and contributed to its improvement We all stood in the sunlight to watch my uncle elevate the new Chevaliers This year the decoration  a rustic metal cross hung on braided string  was awarded to 14yearold Nicolas de Bussac for having completed the restoration of the wheat bin and the renovation of the boat His 15yearold cousin Alain was equally honored for having participated most efficiently in the clearing of the threshing floor and the collection of trout The towering old man wearing his own Legion of Honor rosette beamed with pleasure as he kissed each youngster and hung the decorations around their necks Everyone clapped A few parents wiped tears A regional aperitif walnut wine was served to all W E WERE PICnicking on the causse above La Croze and I asked to hear the words of a song Aunt Simone had taught me when I was a child The loyal loving couples the loyal handsome adolescents joyously burst into song raising their glasses of red wine to the sun Buvons un coupBuvons en deux A la sante des amoureux A la sante du Roi de France    Lets drink a glass lets drink two to the health of lovers to the health of the King of France And then  I knew why I needed to hear it again the refrain was ageless in its loyalties and hatreds Et merde pour la Reine dAngleterre Qui nous a declare la guerre  Politely And down with the Queen of England Who has declared war on us A NOTHER DAY after the habitual Sunday lunch of hot dogs and popsicles my uncle decided to celebrate a very beautiful day by setting off his cannon The cannon stands at the edge of the terrace that overlooks the Tarn a decrepit 17thcentury specimen hed bought decades ago in some local antique shop Yves and Alain went to get the gunpowder and we closed our ears Off it went a thunderous and meaningless explosion over the gorge clouds of putrid fumes rising into the air groups of amazed tourists stopping their cars on the road across the river to stare at the eccentric little nation wreathed in smoke One of my patriotic fantasies my uncle said with a mischievous smile Just another of my little follies Some time later one of my 4yearold cousins seated on her mothers lap asked Questce que cest La Marseillaise Outbursts of indignation Doesnt she know yet What are they taught these days Lets teach her right now And a dozen voices sang again right through to the last brutal verses Marchons marchons quun sang impur abreuve nos sillonsLet us march let us march let impure blood drench our fields Everyone was quiet for a few seconds Then Catherine spoke softly Comme cest beau It was said with sadness with emotion with longing and regret with a certain defiance
COUPLES CAUGHT IN ADOPTION MAZE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/nyregion/couples-caught-in-adoption-maze.html,LAST December Anne and Mel Siegel who wanted to adopt a healthy American baby put this advertisement in four upstate weekly newspapers Warm loving couple seeks white infant to make our life complete Will provide wonderful home and financial security Call collect The responses they said were bizarre One man said his wife was pregnant with quintuplets He told us he had a large family already Mrs Siegel said He asked would we take two One biological mother said My friend did this and got 10000 I told her My lawyer advises we only pay normal medical and legal costs She never called back A third caller a frantic man said he could not pay his rent  If you can get up here today you can have my baby  Mrs Siegel recalled the man saying Mel said We are not rushing up to Albany today to take your baby Dont you want to check us out  The adoption process Mrs Siegel said has begun to sound like an auction with the prize going to the highest bidder The Siegels who live in Flushing would have preferred to work through established channels but as has happened to many couples in such middleclass areas as Long Island they discovered that the majority of nonprofit adoption agencies today have waiting lists that are years long An official of one agency  they applied to four  said What you want  a white preschooler  is a third priority behind minoritygroup handicapped and older children A social worker put it more bluntly You will never get a child here Another Long Island couple who had applied to an agency five years ago and were on a waiting list were turned down this year because the agency said they had grown too old The woman is 39 her husband 50 The shortage of babies for adoption is due to several factors including legalized abortion and increased acceptance of unwed mothers who keep their children Also there is the trend for couples to try to have children at a later age which in some cases leads to infertility problems In addition to private agencies and state and county socialservices departments there is the independent gray market In that process a lawyer matches up a couple with a child Yet another source is foreign adoptions In New York State all four methods are legal but specialists warn that because of the shortage the potential for baby brokering and swindles in independent adoptions is high Moreover a couple may be presented with steep bills for lawyers fees and costly payments to the unwed mother Black market or illegal adoptions can reportedly involve payments of 20000 or more One couple for example in exchange for a baby was reportedly asked to pay the biological mothers college tuition Although there are no reliable figures on the number of American children adopted privately the National Committee for Adoption the largest organization of nonprofit adoption agencies in the country estimates that 8054 children come into the United States annually from other countries the majority from South Korea Latin America is also a large source Jeffrey Rosenberg director of public policy for the committee which is based in Washington acknowledged that there were often long waits for healthy white infants But he said the delays were necessary because the need to insure the legality of adoption and the rights of the child the adopting parents and the natural parents is the bottom line Mr Rosenberg said there were risks in nonagency adoptions because there were no preplacement home studies to determine if the parents were prepared to adopt a child and no medical history of the biological parents The lack of a medical history could raise the risk that a child may have a hereditary illness that is not immediately apparent A number of couples who are in the process of adopting a child or have done so said they saw their choice as adopting privately or from abroad or not at all One Nassau County woman who has a fertility problem that is not correctable spoke of the strain put on her marriage during three years of fruitless fertility testing I finally asked myself she said was it more important for me to be pregnant or to have a family The couple went to adoption agencies throughout the state It was a depressing time she recalled She said The first thing they asked was Would you take a handicapped child The average couple like us says no After two years of waiting because it didnt matter where the child came from  we just wanted to start our family  we opted for foreign adoption Through the assistance of a Long Island support group they located a reputable international adoption source and lawyer in Mexico Six months later the lawyer called them A woman was giving birth shortly Were they interested They flew to Mexico with six cases of formula and 250 diapers staying 21 days to complete a complicated process under Mexican federal and state laws as well as United States immigration rules The couple consider themselves lucky They adore their child The Mexican attorney received a 2000 fee A similar bill was presented by their Long Island lawyer who handled the initial immigration papers and the naturalization No payment was asked by the biological mother Although adoption fees vary authorities say the process can cost as much as a new car The National Committee for Adoption estimates that average costs for an American infant break down into 2500 for medical and hospital care 4950 for maternity home care 600 for fosterhome care for the infant 1000 for adoptiveparents counseling and approximately 1000 for attorneys fees for a total of more than 10000 Couples who attended a recent meeting of the Adoptive Family Network of Bay Terrace a nonprofit support group established by adoptive parents were not concerned about costs however Marge and Charlie Fernandes of Massapequa said they had gone through what Mr Fernandes called plenty of fire drills before they adopted 8monthold Meghan who came from a large orphanage in Bogota Colombia For example just as one independent adoption was about to be completed they learned that the biological mother was an alcoholic They backed out They said the experience of a close friend whose adopted child was twice taken back by the biological mother within 30 days had soured them on independent adoptions That is where the Adoptive Family Network came in for the Fernandes family One of the few such selfhelp groups on Long Island the group assists people who are interested in exploring adoption options The network shares information and procedures to be followed in what it calls an oftentumultuous adoption process We present the options the pros and cons said Charon Goldwyn of Merrick president of the Adoptive Family Network We tell people that whatever their decision is we will work with them through the process The group can be reached at 5460599 What is believed to be the first local selfhelp group started 30 years ago in a kitchen in Bellmore It is the Adoptive Parents Committee of Long Island Its telephone number is 7837197 It is so gratifying to help people become a family said Judy Mankita of Bellmore its president She and her husband Ben adopted an infant in the United Staes a few years ago through the organizations network The Long Island chapter of the Adoptive Parents Committee similar to the Adoptive Family Network gives pre and postadoption workshops At a recent monthly meeting held in space donated by the Jewish Institute of Geriatric Care in New Hyde Park the cofounder of the Adoptive Family Network Diane Bialick led a workshop on Making the Decision Three couples listened intently as Mrs Bialick spoke of the consequences of adoption and experiences the couples might encounter including a possible initial lack of support from friends and family She spoke of the importance of finding a reputable adoption lawyer the costs involved and how a baby may not be for everybody One man emphasized that he did not feel comfortable with adoption If it is possible to have a biological child it would create less problems for me he said His wife looked disappointed Another man said that on a recent vacation after teaching his nephew to swim it finally came home to him what he and his wife were missing One adoptive parent told the newcomers You are pregnant nine months but you have a child forever Because you cant have a biological child does not mean you cant have a family
PROSECUTOR RACES: ISSUES VS. POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/nyregion/prosecutor-races-issues-vs-politics.html,ALTHOUGH Nassau County District Attorney Denis E Dillon a Democrat on heavily Republican Long Island is unopposed for a third term his Republican neighbor Suffolk County District Attorney Patrick Henry faces a Democratic challenge in his bid for a third term Nassau Republicans say their polls indicate that Mr Dillon has an independent nonpartisan image that makes him as popular among Republicans as Democrats He has the endorsement of the Democratic Republican Conservative Liberal and Right to Life Parties The situation of the two prosecutors is also unusual because Mr Dillon was a newcomer to Nassau from New York City when he first ran for District Attorney while Mr Henry is a lifelong Suffolk resident Indeed his father Lindsay Henry was Suffolk District Attorney from 1947 through 1953 Mr Dillon is not without problems however even though they will not affect his reelection He has caused a stir in recent weeks by participating in two antiabortion marches Critics contend that that is not an appropriate action for a prosecutor Mr Dillon has responded that he has a right to express his views Mr Dillons actions also run counter to the position of the Nassau Democratic Party which passed a resolution supporting the right of women to have legal abortions Unlike Mr Dillon Mr Henry has to fight for reelection But his past election victories  by 65000 votes four years ago double the number of votes he received in the race for his first term in 1977  indicate that he is a formidable candidate His Democratic opponent is a 35yearold Setauket lawyer Robert C Gottlieb who is making a second run for office He lost a State Senate race in 1980 Mr Gottlieb is also running on a second line  Ratepayers Against Lilco Mr Henry who is 55 years old has Conservative and Right to Life Party endorsements Mr Gottlieb said that his first task was to make voters in a traditionally Republican county aware that there is a race for District Attorney and then to give them a reason to oust Mr Henry Mr Gottlieb is making an issue of purported political corruption in Suffolk and what he says is Mr Henrys failure to pursue it particularly during his second term after a first term in which the prosecutor was active in that area I think hes gotten lazy and complacent he has done nothing in the area of political corruption Mr Gottlieb said of his opponent He added that threats by William M Blake the Suffolk Republican chairman to promote a Republican primary challenge of Mr Henry earlier this year had left their mark I think he was scared off a good deal by Blake Mr Gottlieb said Mr Henrys office had investigated Mr Blakes fundraising activities when he was Republican chairman in the Town of Babylon  Mr Henrys hometown A grand jury criticized Mr Blakes actions but found no cause for indictment Mr Gottlieb has made an issue of new fundraising efforts by Mr Blake including a letter which has even been criticized by Republicans soliciting funds from county officials Mr Henry found no cause for legal action against Mr Blake and Governor Cuomo has not replied to Mr Gottliebs demands for a special prosecutor to investigate the Blake fundraising Mr Gottlieb a graduate of Cornell University and New York University Law School and a former assistant distict attorney in Manhattan said that if if elected he wanted to model his office after Mr Dillons administration Im trying to make the point of an independent nonpolitical office he said He has also charged that there should have been an investigation into possible criminal activities and organizedcrime involvement in the cost overruns for construction of the Shoreham nuclear plant To emphasize his efforts to establish an independent image he said he would refuse the endorsement of the Suffolk County Patrolmens Benevolent Association if it was offered which it was not The PBA endorsed Mr Henry Mr Gottlieb said the groups endorsement could represent a conflict of interest since a prosecutor must remain independent and objective in his supervision of police investigations PBA officials questioned whether he took the same view toward the Suffolk County Bar Association and its ratings of judicial and lawenforcement candidates I deplore that Mr Gottlieb said adding that the Bar Association should not have veto power over candidates Political leaders on Long Island have agreed not to nominate candidates found unqualified by the county bar associations Mr Gottlieb was found qualified and Mr Henry highly qualified Mr Gottlieb said he hoped to raise and spend 75000 to 100000 on his campaign which is considerably less than the minimum of 200000 he talked of raising last spring He has a modest radio advertising campaign costing about 2500 a week he said that emphasizes the political corruption issue Mr Henry following the strongincumbent strategy has avoided joint appearances with Mr Gottlieb and is generally playing down the election He said he plans some radio advertising and a mailing in the final days before the Nov 5 election As for political corruption the District Attorney said I think were on top of it He mentioned an investigation last year of Brookhaven Republicans He said he did not recall any other corruption inquiries He pointed to a decline in drunkendriving fatalities and household burglaries as high points of his second term He acknowledged the role of the police in these efforts as well as the aging of the county population which tends to reduce the number of such crimes Like Mr Dillon Mr Henry is fast becoming a career prosecutor He has been District Attorney for eight years and before that was an assistant district attorney for 11 years He has not held any other public office He is also president of the State District Attorneys Association
The Right's Attack on the Courts,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/opinion/the-right-s-attack-on-the-courts.html,If the constitutional vision of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and the far right is ever realized we are in for a radical restructuring of our governmental framework The Federal courts role in protecting individual rights would be severely diminished while the job of safeguarding those rights would be left to the legislative and executive branches One element of Mr Meeses vision is an effort to deprive Federal courts of constitutional authority over state officials In a speech to the American Bar Association last July Mr Meese assailed the Supreme Courts 60yearold incorporation doctrine whereby state and local officials are brought under the Bill of Rights as intellectually shaky constitutionally suspect and politically violent Many recent Court decisions he said are more policy choices than articulations of constitutional principle He offered instead a jurisprudence of Original Intention that would read constitutional provisions exactly as the Framers did In August he branded as infamous the Miranda v Arizona and Mapp v Ohio decisions which try to prevent abusive police interrogation and searches The Attorney General was correct in noting that the Bill of Rights the first 10 Amendments originally applied only to Federal officials But he skipped over postCivil War enactments including the 14th Amendment and other civil rights laws which as the Court has said were intended to guarantee basic Federal rights against state power Moreover without the incorporation doctrine we would have to fall back on the subjective policy choices Mr Meese condemns for no other constitutional provision expressly prohibits state and local officials from stifling a critical press preferring or interfering with religion coercing confessions or suppressing books all of which have been attempted by state officials and ruled unconstitutional under the incorporation doctrine Critics of Federal courts however are after much bigger game than that doctrine They seek to end Federal court protection for individual rights regardless of what doctrine is invoked Mr Meeses speech for example attacked the Supreme Courts ban on Federal aid for parochial schools which in no way involves incorporation What the critics seem fundamentally angry about is not so much legal doctrine but the fact that these rights  for example abortion affirmative action religious freedom  are being protected at all The suggestion that we adopt a jurisprudence of Original Intention is disingenuous at best For one thing as Mr Meese well knows judges and lawyers are unreliable historians Although the historical record is often sparse and not illuminating they always manage to find the support in history that they need Furthermore our Constitution was framed to last for centuries not to confine a postindustrial power of 235 million people to the limited horizons of a few statesmen in a weak largely rural and fragmented society of 200 years ago Wiretapping busing and other modern developments could not be foretold by the Framers If we are limited to what was in their minds we would allow official state religion which was common in 1787 and would have to accept the racism and sexism of 1868 when the 14th Amendment was adopted Rightwing spokesmen say they want judicial restraint and would look primarily to elected officials to protect individual rights This would fundamentally reshape our constitutional structure As the Supreme Court has explained protection for certain rights was explicitly written into the Constitution to place [them] beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts The rights commitment to judicial restraint moveover is only a sometime thing When it comes to cutting back on civil liberties or on the other hand promoting property rights these advocates of restraint call for vigorous judicial action against say state protections for the accused rentcontrol laws and Federal wageandhour standards If this assault on the courts ever succeeds our constitutional safeguards will be reduced to majestic platitudes like those in the Soviet Constitution

OUR TOWNS;   GETTING OUT THE VOTE FOR AN ABORTION REFERENDUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/18/nyregion/our-towns-getting-out-the-vote-for-an-abortion-referendum.html,In his push to deliver the antiabortion message all over town the Rev Patrick Mahoney rushed into a maximumcare nursing home one recent afternoon Fifty frail men and women most in wheelchairs  many strapped in had been brought to a recreation room at the Bristol Extended Care home to hear about abortion How many remember the last time I was here Mr Mahoney said cheerfully Three raised their hands Many stared off into space Last time you said Rev Mahoney how can we help stop abortion he continued The answer he said was to vote yes on the Nov 5 referendum You can be activists the fundamentalist minister said Say Yes for life  Yes for life said a woman in a wheelchair I dont mean now said Mr Mahoney I mean voting on the ballot Voting on the ballot repeated the confused woman Mr Mahoney then helped a recreation specialist phone the Election Board to order absentee ballots We can get 30 to 40 votes in a place like this he said Ten places like this thats a lot of votes in Bristol Mr Mahoney is pushing hard on what is being billed as the nations first local abortion referendum He feels the elderly will be one of his key voting blocs in this heavily Roman Catholic workingclass city of 58000 The nonbinding vote is essentially an opinion poll but Mr Mahoney is hoping to deliver the antiabortion shot heard round the world I dont want to sound like Im taking all the credit but yes I was the one who got it started here said the 31yearold minister The supporters of legalized abortion say their job would be easier if Mr Mahoney were a rightwing radical advocating bombing clinics People expect me to be the God guts and gun mentality said the minister In fact he and his current opponents have been allied on many recent causes He supported a local nucleararmsfreeze motion last year he slept in a Dumpster to dramatize the need for an emergency shelter and he then helped open one and he has worked to integrate housing here Im a liberal he said Hes liberal said Laura Minor a leader of the legalizedabortion group But there are cracks if hes pressed Mr Mahoney calls himself a feminist but if pressed says he has problems supporting the equal rights amendment He says he liked Gary Hart but if pressed he says he voted for President Reagan He says he recently stopped by the White House to tell a Presidential spokesman about Bristol In short time Mr Mahoney has become wellknown locally Three years ago he moved from Pompano Beach Fla and built a congregation from scratch His New Covenant fundamental church now has 225 members nearly half of them active antiabortionists A 30foot picture of a fetus sits atop the church and the same picture was used on the church float in Bristols annual Mums flower parade Children would see the fetus and say Mommy look at the baby I thought that was great said Mr Mahoney Bristol is small enough that activists in town know each other and the abortion issue has often turned personal When Mr Mahoney heard that Catherine Blinder was hired by the opposition as its 250aweek campaign manager he immediately labeled her an outsider Miss Blinder lives five miles from Bristol The other side in the abortion dispute pointed out that Mr Mahoneys key donors and the groups lawyer lived outside Bristol Thats different Mr Mahoney said They arent running the campaign I wouldnt make a mistake on that I raised the issue Mr Mahoney and Mrs Minor the legalizedabortion leader used to enjoy talking privately about the issue But supporters on both sides said such talks looked bad and the two stopped Now they meet on talk shows and at debates The average resident may not care At a recent debate only 250 of the school auditoriums 800 seats were filled Both sides agreed there was probably not an unmadeup mind in the house It was easy to tell what people in the audience believed The antiabortionists wore straw hats their opponents did not The antiabortionists waved their hats whenever they felt their side scored a good one  until the moderator made them stop Everyone was aware of political symbolism The hall was full of babies for both sides Members in each camp laughed a bit too loudly at the others slips With Mr Mahoney were two women  both had been through abortions and felt guilty One of the women had her uterus punctured and can no longer have children said Mr Mahoney We feel that is pretty powerful There was no making sense of the oratory The legalizedabortion side used conservative slogans saying depriving women of choice was unAmerican Mr Mahoney used liberal catch phrases saying a society was only as strong as its weakest member The legalizedabortion side felt its scored its biggest point when opponents said that even a raped women should have the baby Mr Mahoney felt his teams big point came when it got the other team to describe abortion in clinical detail In the midst of that a woman in the audience leaped up took off her straw hat yelled Thats murder and ran out Few people with or without hats paid much attention At the end the crowd broke into small groups The straw hats kept to themselves and so did the hatless In the weeks ahead Mr Mahoney will be busy There is a phone bank to be staffed and leaflets to be distributed And on Election Day he has to arrange for getting to the polls those elderly residents who did not cast absentee ballots from Gaylord Retirement Towers the Kennedy retirement apartments and Bristol Extended Care

OBSERVER;   TOTE THAT DUSTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/opinion/observer-tote-that-duster.html,Attorney General Edwin Meese is causing a fuss with his excited view of the Constitution He says the courts interpreting the Constitution ought to consider what its authors intended when they wrote it He suggests the Supreme Court for at least the past 30 years has ignored the intent of those 18thcentury lawyers with the result that we now have a lot of cockeyed laws on the books This is not an abstract argument between jailhouse lawyers Mr Meese has a decisive say about who will go on the Federal bench including the Supreme Court If he wants judges who wont move until they consult the authors intent that is the kind of judges we will have in increasing numbers Obviously this could lead to some very knotty problems in a certain kind of lawsuit Take the famous case that broke up the telephone company Under the Meese doctrine the Court would be obliged to find out how the Constitutions authors intended to deal with monopoly in the telephone business once the telephone was invented Did the Framers know that the telephone would be invented 100 years after the framing was finished If they did why didnt they know the even more dreadful developments that were to occur in the future like the incomprehensible income tax law and frame a clause forbidding such cruel and unusual harassment of the citizenry It seems obvious that they didnt have advance knowledge about anything that was going to happen or be invented after they finished the Constitution This being the case how could they have had any intent toward these things thats worth considering In my opinion even my opinion on breaking up the telephone company would be more valuable than the opinion of William Few or Jared Ingersoll Sure Few and Ingersoll helped frame the Constitution 200 years ago and you have to respect them for that but would you trust either one to make a vital longdistance creditcard call from a pay telephone at a turnpike fastfood dispensary where they had just eaten a piece of pie bought from a slot machine and washed it down with coffee whitened by a chemical powder identifying itself as a nondairy creamer I am describing a situation in which your respect for the Framers is going to be drastically moderated by your instinctive knowledge that while the oldtimers could be brilliant they wouldnt last long enough to get out of their wigs and into a 35 hair styling if you sent them up against the 20th century The weakness here in the Meese doctrine about consulting the framers intent should not be used to discredit the doctrine entirely because the Framers did have clear intentions about a lot of subjects that are still pertinent today I was reminded of this not long ago when paying two college students 12 an hour for an incompetent job of housecleaning After inspecting the unclean corners they had left behind my announcement that they should have been whipped instead of paid drew a shocked rebuke from a friend You talk like a slave driver he said It was true and at that moment I was ashamed of myself Now having pondered the Meese doctrine I say Whats wrong with slavery It is quite clear from skimming the Constitution that the Framers intent was not to abolish slavery Article I Section 2 clearly contemplating that a slave population would exist in future elections specifies how slaves must be counted in the census for purposes of determining how many Congressional seats each state is entitled to hold The figure is precise 60 percent Each slave is constitutionally declared to be 60 percent of a person Did the Framers truly intend this Of course and not only the Framers but a couple of generations of Framer offspring The provision stayed in the Constitution until 1868 Under the Meese doctrine the Supreme Court would be justified it seems to me in having another look at the question of slaverys legality This exciting prospect increases my enthusiasm for the doctrine in spite of the silliness of the telephonetype problem Having to pay insolent and incompetent college students 12 an hour when slavery is an available constitutional alternative strikes me as one of the things thats wrong with this country Regrettably Mr Meese shows little zest for restoring slavery in line with the intent of the Framers He talks instead of trifles One suspects he is merely swatting at flies  trying to outlaw abortion abolish the Miranda rule and other such piffling stuff This is irritating when what you want is to get your house cleaned cheap though preferably free and have the right to lay on with the horsewhip when the picture frames are not properly dusted

WARSAW THRONG MARKS PRIEST'S SLAYING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/20/world/warsaw-throng-marks-priest-s-slaying.html,More than 20000 Poles gathered at a church here tonight to mark the slaying last year of the Rev Jerzy Popieluszko a proSolidarity priest who was kidnapped and killed by four state security men The mass tonight at the church where the priest preached and where he lies buried was the culmination of a weeklong vigil memorializing the life and death of the priest who many believe is destined for sainthood All day long individuals and groups passed before the priests grave with wreaths and placards As night fell and the crowd assembled for the mass a layer of smoke hung over the church from the thousands of memorial candles that had been lit and set on the pavement before St Stanislas Kostka Church In all there were 338 delegations coming from all the cities and many of the towns and farm areas of Poland Some wore the work uniforms of miners steel workers or shipyard welders The placards they carried raised again the characteristic type face of Solidarity the outlawed labor union whose ideals Father Popieluszko had championed Chants of Solidarity In this week after parliammentary elections as Solidaritys underground wing claimed success in its call for a boycott Solidarity and its ideals were quite evidently in the hearts of the mourners Several times they interrupted the sermon by chanting Solidarity and raising their fingers in the unions Vforvictory salute The crowd also intoned the names of its heroes such as Lech Walesa its founder In his sermon the Rev Theofil Bogucki the parish rector who was Father Popieluszkos immediate superior cited the slain priests activities as undertakings to be emulated Do not be silent he told the crowd Christianity is love but it is not silent Father Bogucki well known for his aggressive sermons asked why so many people were being beaten in Poland and he insisted that the kind of love shown by Father Popieluszko is stronger than repression Plan Mass for the Police He was interrupted 18 times by applause and cries of support One of the loudest bursts of applause came when he declared that on Oct 31 there would be a special mass at the church for the police We will pray for Gods justice so that love will conquer death he said from a balcony above the crowd that overflowed the church and the square in front of the church The crowd tonight was much larger and more ardent than on Friday night when 6000 people gathered to hear Jozef Cardinal Glemp the Primate of Poland implicitly warn against creating a cult around the priest who was 37 years old when he was killed Unlike the priests who spoke tonight the Cardinal did not once refer to Father Popieluszko as a martyr and while he expressed his grief at what he termed the unjustified and terrible death he rebuked those who sought to make the churchyard grave a site of pilgrimage with both religious and political overtones The Cardinal then devoted his sermon to condemning abortion
The Pregnant Detective,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/20/magazine/l-the-pregnant-detective-089867.html,As a fan from the start of Cagney  Lacey I was disappointed to find that the shows writers consider being prochoice to be synonymous with opting for an abortion that Mary Beth Laceys choice not to abort would mean coming out against a womans right to make a choice The Pregnant Detective by Karen Stabiner Sept 22 What kind of thinking is that Ive always understood the word choice to mean having alternatives from which to choose Until now the beauty of Mary Beth Laceys characterization has been that it represented just such an alternative And up until now the beauty of the show has been her freedom to present an alternative viewpoint to that of her counterpart Cagney That kind of liberal script has not only allowed the viewer to make a choice but has graced televison with the kind of classical tension essential to good drama The solution to the abortion problem  that of having Mary Beth confess that she had an illegal abortion in Puerto Rico when she was younger too young no doubt to make an informed choice  is a nonsolution It is not only out of character for Lacey but a blatant act of discrimination against those women like myself who given a real choice  one without the coercion of law or the militants in either camp prolife or prochoice  would choose to complete their pregnancies The writers had an exceptional show Its too bad they didnt have the courage to keep it that way MARY A UCALO Ann Arbor Mich

CATHOLICS AND JEWS: A NEW RAPPROCHEMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/20/nyregion/catholics-and-jews-a-new-rapprochement.html,When the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York was revising its guidelines this year on relations between Catholics and Jews its officials spent eight months talking with Jewish leaders in an effort to make the document more sensitive to Jewish misgivings about interfaith marriage Such conversations would probably not have occurred as recently as two decades ago But 20 years ago this month the Second Vatican Council issued the Latin document Nostra Aetate or In Our Times which deplored antiSemitism and said Jews could not collectively be blamed for the death of Jesus Suspicions Begin to Erode Catholic and Jewish leaders agree that in the intervening 20 years relations between Catholics and Jews have undergone a remarkable transformation and suspicions and sterotypes have begun to erode There have been more positive Catholic and Jewish encounters in this country in the last 20 years than there were in the first 1900 years of Christianity said Rabbi A James Rudin director of interreligious affairs of the American Jewish Committee We may differ because family members differ but there is a mutual respect that was not present 20 years ago That transformation is to be marked symbolically in New York today when John Cardinal OConnor gives an address on CatholicJewish relations not in St Patricks Cathedral but in Temple EmanuEl at Fifth Avenue and 65th Street the citys largest synagogue Dramatic changes are evident on a more substantive level as well Books and lessons in parochial school classrooms have been altered not only to eliminate references to Jews as the killers of Christ but also to stress Jesus Jewishness and to recognize the validity of Gods covenant with the Jewish people Twentysix percent of Catholic high schools now use material on the Holocaust and nearly all Catholic colleges have courses on Judaism Its remarkable said Eugene J Fisher executive secretary for CatholicJewish relations at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Traditionally we didnt teach Judaism as something of relevance Now the relevance for Catholic thinking and life is accepted Catholic and Jewish leaders routinely meet in dioceses around the world to discuss a wide variety of issues These meetings are regarded as important for allowing leaders on both sides to vent feelings when sensitive political incidents occur such as Pope John Paul IIs meeting with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat Interfaith Marriages But such meetings are also significant for smoothing daytoday relations in such areas as interfaith marriage All but a few rabbis refuse to perform interfaith marriages because of their distress about continued Jewish losses to assimilation and because of religious strictures that bar mixed marriages without a conversion by the Christian partner Catholic priests however are willing to preside jointly with rabbis at interfaith ceremonies provided the couple has received a dioscesan dispensation Brother William Martyn the New York Archdioceses specialist on CatholicJewish relations said he was pleased that talks were held with Jewish leaders about the guidelines on interfaith marriages because their thoughts would help priests become more sensitive to both communities Haggadah for Catholics Other examples of a changed atmosphere abound The Archdiocese of Chicago has published a Passover Haggadah adapted by a rabbi Leon Klenicki for use by Catholics who want to celebrate the seder with their Jewish friends or neighbors or experience the seder as Jesus did Rabbi Klenicki director of interfaith affairs for the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith says 70000 copies have been sold The Sisters of Our Lady of Sion a Roman Catholic order founded by a French priest in 1846 to pray for the conversion of the Jews has abandoned that mission and now sees its main purpose as helping Christians understand Judaism In the Rockaways in Queens Jews and Catholics strove though with little success to calm tensions among Catholics and liberal Jews that arose earlier this year when Orthodox Jews erected an eruv a makeshift boundary that marks a district in which Orthodox Jews may carry or wheel things on Saturdays acts they would be forbidden to do on the sabbath except in their homes Pulpits Often Shared Rabbis and priests frequently preach from each others pulpits Students for the rabbinate and the priesthood have met for frank discussions about what their seminaries teach about Judaism and Christianity Members of synagogues and Catholic churches get together in each others livingrooms to discuss community and religious problems According to Mr Fisher polls indicate that the attitudes of Jews and Catholics toward each other have become more sympathetic Most of the improvement has involved efforts by Catholics to understand Jews Rabbi Klenicki acknowledges because historically it was Christian misconceptions about Judaism that contributed to the persecution of Jews Yet Rabbi Klenicki says efforts are under way to have Jews understand more about Christianity The AntiDefamation League and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia have joined to prepare a booklet designed to introduce Jews to the history and the central beliefs of Christianity Tensions remain Orthodox Jews have been hesitant about exchanges with Catholic leaders fearing a dilution of their exacting religious principles They find that they can side with Catholics even against more liberal Jews in opposing legalized abortion and advocating aid to parochial schools but they scrupulously avoid almost all theological questions Rabbi Binyamin Walfish executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America the largest group of Orthodox rabbis said leading rabbis felt that Judaism and Catholicism and Protestantism are so irreconcilable that dialogue on theological issues is futile and creates more dissension than it does understanding Statement of Hope Mr Fisher of the bishops conference is not offended by such hesitance After the trauma of the Holocaust he said he is surprised that there are as many Jews who are willing to take that terrible risk of opening up in dialogue and added That to me is a miracle and a real statement of hope Several Jewish leaders have also voiced disappointment with a Vatican document issued in June Notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in Preaching and Catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church One objection was that it mentioned the importance of the Holocaust to Jews but did not stress the moral challenge the Holocaust poses for Christians There is also considerable tension over the Vaticans refusal to extend full diplomatic recognition to Israel through an exchange of ambassadors The Vaticans refusal according to Mr Fisher is partly based on the ambiguity of Israels claim to the West Bank and other territories and partly on fear of what Christians in Arab countries might suffer should Israel be formally recognized Jews and Catholics in the United States are concerned that Nostra Aetate has not been embraced with as much vigor in other countries even though they are aware that the population mix in the United States of 50 million Catholics and 58 million Jews is not matched elsewhere Oberammergau Play Cited Jewish leaders for example continue to be offended by the Passion play put on every decade at Oberammergau West Germany which they feel is laced with antiSemitic caricatures and contradicts the spirit of Nostra Aetate Still Msgr John M Oesterreicher director of the Institute of JudeoChristian Studies at Seton Hall University in South Orange NJ said that while suspicions and sterotypes linger I would be hard put to name a country where there have been no contacts The tensions that remain can seem like so much quibbling to Catholics and Jews who recall the atmosphere of distrust that existed before 1965 After a history of persecution that included the Crusades and the Inquisition and despite the Holocaust many Catholic books and teachers still viewed Jews as a people cursed by God In Christianity said Michael Wyschogrod director of the Institute for JewishChristian Relations at the American Jewish Congress the view was widely held that Jews were the chosen people until Jesus and when they rejected Jesus that election went to the church Reexamination by Catholics Nostra Aetate changed that One of the major documents adopted as part of the Second Vatican Councils effort to reform and modernize the Roman Catholic Church it was promulgated Oct 28 1965 It dealt with the relationship of the Catholic Church to all nonChristian religions The words nostra aetate were the first words of the document The documents roots stretched back to the reexamination among Catholic thinkers that followed the Holocaust Pope John XXIII who summoned the council had felt the pain of the Jewish plight when as Apostolic Delegate to Turkey he helped hundreds of Jews elude the Nazis Later in 1960 he was particularly moved by a visit from the French Jewish historian Jules Isaac who argued that false and unjust statements in Christian teaching needed to be corrected The threepage document that emerged from the council stressed the spiritual bond linking the covenants of Judaism and Christianity It took note that Jews did not in large number accept the Gospel and that the Jewish authorities pressed for the death of Jesus But it said What happened in His passion cannot be blamed upon all the Jews then living without distinction nor upon the Jews of today

MAN IN THE NEWS;   A LIBERAL AND A SKEPTIC/David Robert Peterson,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/21/business/man-in-the-news-a-liberal-and-a-skeptic-david-robert-peterson.html,David Peterson is the first Premier of Ontario in nearly 42 years who has not been a member of the Progressive Conservative Party Since being sworn in on June 26 he has made some sharp turns from the policies of his Tory predecessors but has also demonstrated some strong continuities The reservations that Mr Peterson a 41yearold Liberal expresses about a proposal for freetrade talks between Canada and the United States echo strong themes in Ontario history Ontario is the richest province  claiming a third of Canadas population and half its manufacturing  and the belief that tough trade barriers are needed to protect its industry is held widely here At the same time there is a growing realization that Canadas resource industries such as mining and lumber are fading and that foreign competition may greatly erode the North American auto industry that is Ontarios economic lifeblood Secure access to the United States market 10 times larger than Canadas is considered vital As he weighs these questions Mr Peterson has become the most publicly skeptical of Canadas 10 provincial premiers about the freetrade talks proposed last month by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney who leads the Progressive Conservative Party Now Mr Peterson is taking his concerns to Washington for meetings with Senators Representatives and Administration officials during a threeday stay that begins Monday The question is what are we going to get out of this situation Mr Peterson said in an interview and that has not been determined yet Like many other Canadians Mr Peterson worries that the rising tide of protectionism on Capitol Hill could drastically reduce Canadian exports That means he will be pressing this week for continued secure access for Canadian goods While he may share his Tory predecessors wariness on freetrade matters Mr Peterson definitely differs from them in matters of style Married to an actress the former Shelley Matthews Mr Peterson is almost universally described as a yuppie politician appealing to young voters with a cool televisionoriented style The Petersons have three young children Ben Chloe and Adam a dog named Blueberry Muffin and a cat called Strawberry Shortcake The Premier is a dedicated jogger He is not well known yet in Washington where he was identified as David Anderson in a notice of his appearance at a National Press Club breakfast Born in Toronto David Robert Peterson was born on Dec 29 1943 in Toronto and grew up in London Ontario where he received a bachelors degree from the University of Western Ontario He also has a law degree from the University of Toronto and studied at the University of Caen in France and the Osgood Hall Law School at York University in Downsview Ontario He went into the family business importing and distributing electronic equipment and became president of the company at 26 He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in 1975 from his hometown of London In 1982 he was elected leader of the provincial Liberal Party but political observers did not consider his prospects overwhelming Because there is little linkage between the provincial parties and the federal ones he was not particularly helped by the apparatus and expertise of the federal Liberal Party formerly headed by Pierre Elliott Trudeau Many pointed to Bob Rae leader of the New Democratic Party as the star of the legislature There was talk that the New Democratic Party which favors greater governmental expenditures to help the needy would overtake the Liberals and become the No 2 party in the province But in the May election the New Democrats increased their seats by just three to 25 while the Liberals nearly doubled theirs to 48 Postelection polls credited the Liberals strong showing to Mr Petersons personal popularity Although the Progressive Conservatives won the most seats 52 the other two parties were able to combine and form a minority government This involved a deal under which the Liberals agreed to endorse a number of New Democrat ideas in return for the New Democrats promise to support the Government for at least two years A Range of Issues The compromise included a commitment to comparableworth legislation governing womens wages in the public and private sectors an end to public medical insurance payments to physicians whose bills exceed the fees set by the province and more prounion labor laws However Mr Peterson refused to agree to the New Democrats industrial policies which call for a greater degree of public ownership than he was willing to accept Indeed he is trying to sell the Ontario Governments 25 percent interest in the Sun Companys Canadian operations He is also considering abandoning both the provinces venture capital company and its troubled manufacturer of urban transit equipment But the new Premier has carefully avoided ideological identifications much in the style of William Davis who served as Premier for 14 years until last January Bland works was a favorite saying of Mr Daviss Still Mr Peterson now faces a number of questions that will soon require clearcut answers He must decide whether to continue construction of Ontario Hydros Darlington nuclear power plant on which 7 billion Canadian has been spent Stopping construction would save 4 billion in projected costs He must decide how to proceed with his commitment to expand public funding for Catholic high schools which has long been opposed by Protestants whether to fulfill a campaign promise to allow the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores very much opposed in rural areas and what stance the province should take in a bitter fight over whether to close a Toronto abortion clinic while its fate is being decided in courts Concern over Bond Rating Lurking behind these questions is Ontarios tripleA bond rating held sacrosanct by the Conservatives but now in danger of being lowered Liberals are already pointing out that most provinces have had their ratings lowered in the last two years and that the practical effects of a downgrading would be minimal Mr Peterson said last week that he is anticipating a downgrading The first budget of the new Liberal Government expected later this month he said will not be dictated by New York bankers In the meantime his final judgment on the freetrade issue is anxiously awaited not least by Prime Minister Mulroney The Premiers cards are kept close to the chest If someone can prove to me that we can make a better deal he said with a slight smile believe me Im a very practical fellow
"CATHOLICS SUFFERED, TOO, O'CONNOR SAYS TO JEWS",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/21/nyregion/catholics-suffered-too-o-connor-says-to-jews.html,John Cardinal OConnor appealed to a largely Jewish audience gathered yesterday to mark a milestone in Roman CatholicJewish relations to understand that Catholics too have suffered and have been the victims of oppression Speaking at Temple EmanuEl the Cardinal talked with emotion about how his heart had been torn to shreds at reading the literature of the Holocaust But despite the horror of that event he said Jews must recognize that Catholics have suffered as well Ultimately we cannot accept a trivialization of as it would seem to us of our sorrow of our suffering of our oppression at various times through the centuries he said We cannot accept an ignoring a brushing off of these as not worthy of consideration because they are not comparable to the mystery of the suffering of the Holocaust Commemorating Breakthrough The Cardinal the spiritual head of nearly 2 million Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York spoke before 600 people who had gathered in the temples cavernous and ornate sanctuary at 1 East 65th Street to mark the 20th anniversary this month of Nostra Aetate the document of the Second Vatican Council that deplored antiSemitism and said that Jews as a people could not be held responsible for the death of Jesus The document which led to significant changes in Catholic books and teaching created a major breakthrough in relations between the two faiths The Cardinals remarks could be seen as controversial since some Jewish thinkers have resisted any comparisons to the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were systematically murdered as diminishing that event Indeed the Cardinal was criticized shortly before he was installed in New York as Archbishop last year for comparing widespread abortion in the United States to the Holocaust However Rabbi A James Rudin the national interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee and one of the speakers at the ceremony said in a telephone interview last night that he did not think the Cardinals remarks diminished the significance of the Holocaust He was speaking very clearly about the uniqueness of the Holocaust Rabbi Rudin said and then he said he was not comparing but he was saying suffering is the human lot The Cardinal wearing a brilliant red cape over a black robe joined the temples rabbi Ronald B Sobel and other priests and rabbis in a procession down the synagogues main aisle to the stately voices of a choir Ridding Us of Myths When the Cardinals turn came to speak he praised Nostra Aetate for ridding us of myths held through history by some Catholics that in persecuting Jews they were carrying out the will of God Still he said he wanted go beyond such statements to express my feelings with remarks that he said were perhaps unwise imprudent and risk great vulnerability Departing from an eightpage prepared text he recalled an incident that occurred last year shortly after he became Archbishop of New York He recalled that he was standing on the steps of St Patricks Cathedral watching a parade protesting the treatment of Soviet Jews when a woman in the march shook her fist at him and rebuked him with the question Why are you not marching with us Since he had come out onto the steps to express his sympathy with those in the parade he said he was wounded by the womans remark and mulled her motives Is it however not that those of you of Jewish faith cannot understand the suffering of Christians the Cardinal said but that you sincerely believe that no suffering in the entire world in all history can in anyway be comparable to the Holocaust and therefore it becomes blasphemous and sacrilegious for any of us to enunciate our suffering and compare it with yours Each of Us Suffers The Cardinal described how he had steeped himself in the literature of the Holocaust and had wept and been deeply chilled by the books of the writer Elie Wiesel and others I plead with you to recognize that the one common universal discourse the one common frame of reference for all people everywhere is suffering he said Each of us suffers Mystery of Suffering Understanding that all people suffer he said in his speech would provide the true foundation for dialogue between Christians and Jews Concluding his address he said Only as I share your sense of the sacred your sense of sacramentality your sense of the mystery of suffering only to the degree I might state boldly that I become Jewish am I truly Catholic As he left the temple the Cardinal cautioned that his thoughts on the subject were not fully developed but he added I think Im onto something
REAGAN SAYS HE'LL USE VACANCIES TO DISCOURAGE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/22/world/reagan-says-he-ll-use-vacancies-to-discourage-judicial-activism.html,President Reagan promised today to use the rest of his second term to appoint Federal judges who seek judicial restraint and he criticized those who view courts as vehicles for political action and social experimentation Mr Reagan speaking to a group of United States Attorneys said he would appoint to the bench lawyers who understand the danger of shortcircuiting the electoral process and disenfranchising the people through judicial activism Officials said Mr Reagans comments reflected growing awareness in the White House that his chief and most lasting legacy may be his appointments to the judiciary Justice Department officials said that Mr Reagan has so far appointed about 27 percent of the nations Federal judges but by the end of his term the figure could well rise to about 50 percent Subject of Increasing Interest In the past Mr Reagan has been criticized by some constitutional lawyers and civil liberties groups for his appointments and for his comments on the role of the Federal judiciary Mr Reagans remarks today were some of his most pointed so far on a subject that aides said has been of increasing interest to him especially with the appointment of his friend Edwin Meese 3d as Attorney General In some ways Mr Reagans comments reflected the impact of Mr Meese a longtime confidant who helped shape many of the Administrations legal programs from his post as White House chief of staff in the first Reagan term With Mr Meeses appointment as Attorney General last year the drive for key changes in the judicial system has gathered new momentum Founding Fathers Cited The independence of the courts from improper political influence is a sacred principle Mr Reagan told the Federal prosecutors who gathered at the Old Executive Office Building adjoining the White House It must always be guarded And let me assure you it will always be guarded while this Administration is in office But as you know the Founding Fathers knew that like any other part of the Government the power of the judiciary could be abused he said They never intended for example that the courts preempt legislative prerogatives or become vehicles for political action or social experimentation or for coercing the populace into adopting anyones personal view of utopia Mr Reagan noted that the nations founders placed the appointive power of the judiciary in the hands of those who are in office as a result of popular election In the last two Presidential campaigns he said I made it clear to the American public that I felt the courts had sometimes gone too far in interfering with the constitutional prerogatives of other branches of government even while they neglected their constitutional duty of protecting society from those who prey on the innocent Well this is still my belief said Mr Reagan I want judges of the highest intellectual standing who harbor the deepest regard for the Constitution and its traditions  one of which is judicial restraint Some Criticize Remarks Some constitutional lawyers and others asked to comment on Mr Reagans remarks responded sharply The platitudes about judicial restraint and the limits of judicial power are unobjectionable in themselves said Laurence H Tribe the Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard but obviously represent code words for a Federal judiciary handpicked to serve a concrete social and political agenda with respect to the right of privacy including abortion with respect to school prayer and with respect to affirmative action Mr Tribe said he and other liberals were especially concerned about the possibility of one or two Supreme Court openings in the next few years coupled with the stacking of the lower Federal judiciary by nominees selected on narrow ideological criteria May Name Half the Judges Anthony Podesta the president of People for the American Way a liberal citizens group focusing on constitutional issues said By suggesting that the Bill of Rights is being enforced too vigorously by the judicial branch Mr Reagan is seeming to tinker with our very constitutional system If the President sees it otherwise his argument should be with Hamilton and Madison Grover Rees a special assistant to Mr Meese who supervises the judicial selection process said in an interview that Mr Reagan had so far appointed 173 judges to Federal District Courts and 47 judges to the Court of Appeals We look for extreme intelligence extreme skill and a commitment to a role for Federal judges said Mr Rees We also look for experience for temperament for all the things that anybody would look for in a judge Mr Rees said there was a distinction between ideology and philosophy in selecting candidates for the Federal bench He said for example that he did not seek out a prospective judges opinion on abortion or busing or flouridation or other specific political and social issues We do discuss constitutional law and techniques or constittuinal statutory interpretation and other questions pertaining to the role of a judge in a democratic society he said We look for judicial philosophy not ideology We dont want judges enacting conservative ideology from the bench any more than we want them enacting liberal ideology

MORAL RIGHT'FERVOR LAPS AT NEW ZEALAND SHORE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/22/world/moral-right-fervor-laps-at-new-zealand-shore.html,It was the biggest petition effort in the history of New Zealand bigger even than the drive a decade ago to save the white birch trees of the South Island The subject reflected the changing times in this nation where urbanization and modern values are challenging traditional ways of life homosexual rights At the end of September what organizers said were more than 800000 people  nearly a third the number who voted in the last election  signed a petition to block legislation that would remove criminal penalties for homosexual acts between consenting adults The petition marked the emergence of this countrys fastestgrowing political bloc what is known here as the moral right a movement consciously modeled on Americas Moral Majority Advice From Americans Activists here say the arena is larger than New Zealand itself They say this tiny traditionminded nation with a population of 32 million is an ideal testing ground for the tactics of foreign rightwing groups Newspapers say American fundamentalist organizers have visited to offer advice and to help drum up support The issue has become almost overnight one of the most emotional topics in the land In its fervor it surpasses the twin foreign affairs issues in which the country has found itself embroiled recently  the sinking of the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior and the dispute with Washington over the docking of nuclear vessels  and it has gained an overtone of urgency with the first reports of AIDS cases in New Zealand The emotion ran high on Sept 24 when 800 flagwaving hymnsinging supporters arrived at the steps of Parliament with 91 cardboard boxes each labeled The people have spoken Wearing red white and blue sashes bearing the legend For God for family for country and singing the hymn Amazing Grace they carried the boxes with pages of the petition inside them to the top of the steps where they formed a 10foothigh wall Behind a barrier below them some 300 counterdemonstrators with colored balloons sported buttons that read HUG which stands for Heterosexuals Unafraid of Gays 24 Demonstrators Arrested As this crowd waving placards with such slogans as I signed 27 times pressed against the barrier the police moved in and arrested 23 for disturbing the peace and one for assaulting an officer Standing on the steps beside the wall of petition boxes organizers issued a warning to politicians of the power they believed they had behind them Beware beware the grass roots are moving said Keith Hay a businessman who is a cofounder of the organizing group the Coalition of Concerned Citizens The people of New Zealand are saying Gentlemen we have had enough Mr Prime Minister I tell you beware Peter Tait another cofounder of the organization addressed the counterprotesters who were singing a song that contained the line Were here because were queer What you are doing is against the Bible and against the law of God he said Such an Obscene Sight Fran Wilde a Member of Parliament who has been vocal in supporting homosexual law changes told reporters Im just so angry I feel sick Ive never seen such an obscene sight They are the ones who are the perverts Miss Wilde and her allies immediately challenged the organizers claim to have gathered such a large number of signatures and discovered what she said was a large proportion that appeared to have been signed by the same hand or to reflect fictitious names But as The New Zealand Herald suggested in an editorial even if thousands or tens of thousands of the signatures turn out to be fraudulent the petition remains a substantial expression of concern The popular emotion that led up to the presentation of the 91 cardboard boxes and the new political force it has helped to create go well beyond the question of homosexual rights Traditional Values Defended Coalition leaders have said their lobbying against the bill is just the first step in a bid to assert their power in defending what they call traditional family values Next they say they may focus on abortion sex education womens rights and a proposed bill of rights for New Zealand that would enshrine such ideals as freedom of speech religion and assembly If the signatures on the antihomosexual law reform petition stand a rigorous examination The Evening Post wrote there can be little doubt that the concerned citizens will be a major electoral force in 1987 The groundswell of support for traditional values some commentators here say has grown in part as a reaction to a new class of urban affluent and upwardly mobile people who have begun over the past decade to see themselves as sharing the ethics of a world beyond New Zealands rural pastures It is the same divisions they say that lie behind other emotional issues here  the split between rugby enthusiasts and opponents of apartheid who have blocked games with South Africa or between those who want a strong defense and those who oppose nuclear arms New Zealands homosexual law which dates from 1867 bans unnatural acts between men but makes no mention of women The proposed legislation would remove criminal penalties for homosexual acts between men of 16 or older and would also make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual preference Backers of the change say it is more necessary than ever with the spread of AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome into New Zealand Education Campaign Begins A campaign has been started to educate the public about the new disease which so far has mainly affected homosexuals Three hospitals in New Zealands three major cities have been designated as treatment centers for AIDS Speaking of AIDS Miss Wilde said It will be impossible to run an effective public health program when the members of one of the target groups are defined as criminals under the law She and others who support the legislation argue that decriminalization would not lead to more homosexuality but instead would remove an unenforceable law But the debate has now gone far beyond such arguments and its outcome is likely to be based on issues and emotions that are only incidentally related to questions about homosexuality
SENATORS CONFIRM SOLICITOR WHO SEEKS BAR TO ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/23/us/senators-confirm-solicitor-who-seeks-bar-to-abortion.html,The Senate confirmed Charles Fried a Harvard law professor as Solicitor General today The action on President Reagans nomination was taken by voice vote with no debate despite public controversy over the positions Mr Fried had taken in the Court as Acting Solicitor General since June He wrote the Administrations legal brief this summer arguing that there was no constitutional right to abortion and urging that the Supreme Court reverse its 1973 ruling recognizing that right Some of Mr Frieds predecessors and fellow scholars today mixed praise for his abilities with criticism of some positions he has taken The Solicitor General is the Governments chief advocate in the Supreme Court At the same time the office has historically been viewed as having obligations to the Court equal virtually to their obligations to the Administration as Archibald Cox who was Solicitor General from 1961 to 1965 put it today Assertiveness on Legal Issues But lately there has been much discussion in legal circles about whether the Reagan Administration is changing that The Administration clearly has taken a more assertive posture toward the Supreme Court While Mr Fried has been filing briefs aggressively advocating Administration policies on abortion and other issues Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has been denouncing some Supreme Court precedents and questioning dozens more Mr Cox who has also been Mr Frieds colleague on the Harvard faculty said he was delighted with the confirmation but voiced concern that Mr Frieds briefs on abortion and affirmative action were not consistent with the traditions of the office He noted that the brief filed by Mr Fried as a friend of the court urging that the 1973 abortion ruling be reversed took a position espoused by none of the parties to the case Filing a brief of this kind when the parties havent raised the issue does not help the Court said Mr Cox notwithstanding the doubts that he has expressed in his own writings about whether the court correctly interpreted the Constitution in arriving at its 1973 decision on abortion It tends to give the general public the impression that decisions are political and social engineering Erwin N Griswold who was Solicitor General from 1967 to 1973 and was dean of Harvard Law School when he invited Mr Fried to join the faculty said the new Solicitor General would do a good job Mr Griswold now a Washington lawyer said he did not share Mr Coxs concerns about the abortion brief and called it a good professional job Man of Principle Rex E Lee who was the Reagan Administrations Solicitor General until he returned to private law practice in June also praised Mr Frieds confirmation He is a man of principle and whatever he does he will do as a matter of principle Mr Lee said Mr Lee did not dispute an interviewers suggestion that Mr Frieds approach to the office differed considerably from his own But he said Mr Fried understands as well as I do that there is going to be criticism no matter which way you go about accommodating and striking just the right balance between your obligation to the President who appointed you on the one hand and on the other your obligation as an officer of the Court Mr Fried has also signed briefs arguing broadly that all governmental and courtordered preferences for racial minorities are unconstitutional and urging a narrow interpretation of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act that were intended to make it easier to prove violations Mr Lee while sharing Mr Frieds view that the Supreme Court erred in finding a constitutional right to abortion has said he thought it would undermine the stature of his office and be counterproductive to urge the Court to overrule a precedent when it clearly is not disposed to do so Im not the pamphleteer general Im the Solicitor General Mr Lee said more than once in response to conservatives who faulted him as not pushing the Administrations agenda on abortion school prayer and other issues Mr Fried a 50yearold native of Czechoslovakia is a graduate of Princton University and holds law degrees from Columbia and Oxford Universities He was a clerk for Justice John Harlan of the Supreme Court in 196061 and taught at Harvard Law School from 1961 until he took a leave of absence to become Deputy Solicitor General last December

MAN IN THE NEWS: CHARLES FRIED;   COURT VOICE OF REAGANISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/24/us/man-in-the-news-charles-fried-court-voice-of-reaganism.html,Charles Fried sat in the vast office that became his this morning and pondered a question to which no properly circumspect Solicitor General of the United States would give a direct answer What did he think of Justice William J Brennan Jrs recent thinly veiled suggestion that the approach to constitutional law advocated by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d was little more than arrogance cloaked as humility The answer A quick no comment except that I have a particular feeling of warmth for Justice Brennan Mr Fried noted that he was a law clerk for Justice John Marshall Harlan 25 years ago and Justice Brennan was always a very friendly genial person As Solicitor General the Governments chief advocate in the Supreme Court Mr Fried who is now 50 years old will have the task of striking a balance between advancing conservative Administration positions that sometimes clash with Court precedent and preserving the special stature his office has always had in the Court He Has Worked in Post He was sworn in this morning by Mr Meese his boss after the Senate confirmed him Tuesday He has been Acting Solicitor General since June when Rex E Lee his predecessor returned to law practice Still on leave of absence from Harvard Law School where he has taught since 1961 Mr Fried brings to the job the background not of a practicing lawyer but of a scholar who likes to quote Aquinas Dante Kant and the contemporary philosopher John Rawls Philosophy always has been and still is my first love the teacher of jurisprudence and Roman law said This background Mr Fried suggested together with his view that the Solicitor General should tell the Court frankly what he thinks rather than what he thinks it wants to hear may help explain the widely remarked difference between his approach and that of some predecessors Differences of Approach Mr Lee who unlike Mr Fried never urged upon the Court the Administrations view that the Courts abortion precedents were wrong once said he had been concerned lest such a step produce a ruling reinforcing those precedents and undermining the credibility of his office Mr Fried stressing that he did not intend any criticism of Mr Lee said today that he personally avoided what he called the manipulative approach of lawyers who urged their own views upon the Court only to the extent that they supposed the Justices would agree His own approach he said was to give principled voice to the concerns of the elected Administration as far as they could be translated into respectable legal arguments and to give the Court my best thought on the subject I think of them as people with whom Im in an intellectual conversation about the law he said of the Justices I think that is at least as respectful an attitude He Was Born in Prague Mr Fried pronounced freed was born Karel Fried in Prague on April 15 1935 son of a senior vice president of the Skoda Works an arms and automotive concern He described his father Antony as a Czech patriot His family and other Czech patriots always looked to the United States and to American democracy for inspiration he said The Fried family which was Jewish fled the Nazis late in 1938 or early 1939 going to England and moving to New York in 1941 Mr Fried attended public schools in New York City the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey where I think the most important things I learned were Latin and Greek and Princeton University where he studied comparative literature and philosophy After a year on a Fulbright Scholarship studying law and philosophy at Oxford he decided to become a teacher in these fields and returned to Columbia Law School Upon graduating he worked in 196061 as a law clerk for Justice Harlan whom he recalled as the perfect judge because he believed in reason He believed in it to the degree Mr Fried said that he was troubled when he and his barely fledged clerks could not reason their way through to agreement on how a case should be resolved In Ronald Reagans Washington Mr Fried finds himself in the intellectual vanguard of conservative thought operating on the legal front He counts among his close friends T Kenneth Cribb Jr Counselor to Mr Meese and Michael J Horowitz General Counsel of the Office of Management and Budget two of the Administrations most active conservatives Mr Fried married Anne Summerscale in 1959 She is on leave from a teaching job near Boston working here as an editor at the National Gallery They have a son Gregory and a daughter Antonia Asked how he liked living in a capital of political intrigue and factional fighting after 25 years in Cambridge Mass he alluded to the feuding on the Harvard law faculty I miss Cambridge in many ways but its nice to get away from the politics he said
KOCH AND RIVALS CLASH IN DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/25/nyregion/koch-and-rivals-clash-in-debate.html,Mayor Koch declared yesterday that he would try within the next few months to broaden the citys authority to hospitalize and care for incompetent homeless people temporarily even without their permission Were going to within the limits of the Constitution and the law seek to expand our right to go out and bring people in who cannot make competent decisions for their own safety Mr Koch said during a debate with three rivals for mayor at The New York Times It was the first and very likely the only debate before the Nov 5 election Its incredible to think that we cant do it and I think we are going to do it to some extent Mr Koch said referring to constitutional objections to such involuntary confinement The people who are interpreting the Constitution are dumb he added The fathers of this Constitution did not allow people who didnt have the intelligence because of mindclouding of various sorts to destroy themselves One of Mr Kochs opponents in the mayoral race City Council President Carol Bellamy who is the Liberal Party nominee said she was not convinced that the law had to be changed and that the city could not act under present health and safety standards Diane McGrath the RepublicanConservative candidate criticized civil libertarians who have opposed such measures in the past while Rabbi Lew Y Levin the Right to Life Party nominee said the city should have such power The four candidates disagreed on two other issues  the future of community school boards and whether bathhouses catering to homosexuals should be closed as a means of halting the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome Mayor Koch said he would defer to state and city health officials on the bathhouses Miss Bellamy opposed closing them and Mrs McGrath and Rabbi Levin strongly supported a shutdown The rabbi said he would institute legal action forcing the closing of the bathhouses if the city did not act Waste and Corruption The split was different on the question of local school boards Mrs McGrath said the city should move toward eliminating the local boards contending that they were responsible for waste and corruption Mr Koch while criticizing Mrs McGrath for making what he termed unsubstantiated charges said he had urged the Legislature to make an inquiry as to the success or failure of decentralization He said that he had been unsuccessful so far because people are afraid to find out and that when people are afraid to find out then we ought to redouble our efforts to find out Miss Bellamy and Rabbi Levin supported the local school boards A More Subdued Candidate The 90minute session was generally more friendly than some of the debates during the Democratic mayoral primary campaign Miss Bellamy particularly was more subdued than she had been in the primary campaign If she loses the mayoral election her city service will presumably end Dec 31 when her term as Council President expires During the debate the Mayor often sat with chin in hand looking at the floor then looking at the ceiling as if his patience and endurance were being tested But that was not the case during the most heated exchange which came when Rabbi Levin strongly criticized the Mayor  even questioning his personal morality  for speaking at a Jewish temple attended by homosexuals marching in a homosexuals parade that was said to have included members of the North American ManBoy Love Association assertedly condoning pornography and pressuring religious institutions receiving government aid to issue bans on discrimination against homosexuals We have a mayor of New York who runs this city like it was a giant Greenwich Village singles bar the rabbi said No Matter Who Goes Mr Koch only responding to the homosexual temple assertion said that I never thought that a rabbi would denigrate a synagogue  no matter who goes to the synagogue He added Dont you want them to come I mean in most religions whether it be homosexuals or heterosexuals whether it be sinners or angels if you can get them into the place of worship thank God When the rabbi tried to interrupt Mr Koch shot back that this is not the pulpit Responding Rabbi Levin accused Mr Koch of obfuscating and wearing your Judaism on a lapel A Step Away In the traditional Orthodox community he said you are really sort of a step away from excommunication Leaning behind the other two candidates to make eye contact with the mayor the rabbi said As a Jew I feel youre an embarrassment as a religious person as a family person I think the things you are doing are obscene The rabbi repeatedly referred to family values more than abortion during the debate The Mayor his face grim did not respond but later he told reporters that he would not let vile people keep him from a parade Were not going to let the vile people hijack a parade he said Qualifications at Issue Other than occasional asides the only other strong criticism by the candidates came when they were asked whether their opponents were qualified Miss Bellamy said Mrs McGrath and Rabbi Levin had not done their homework on substantive issues and Mrs McGrath responded that after seven years as a public official Miss Bellamys position on issues was still not known to the general public The candidates also made these points during the debate  All four candidates in varying degrees said education would be a priority in their administrations  a contrast to recent mayoral campaigns when crime was the predominant subject  The Mayor acknowledged that he made a mistake in 1982 when he favored repeal of a city tax on capital gains in realestate sales of 1 million or more  a tax that has been picked up by the state Mr Koch now wants a rise in the tax with the added money to be used to maintain the 90cent subway and bus fares Miss Bellamy said she had opposed repeal but the Mayor doubted that If she can produce a statement that she supported continuation Id love to see it he said  Mr Koch defended Borough President Ralph J Lamberti of Staten Island who was accused by City Investigations Commissioner Patrick W McGinley of conflictofinterest violations of the City Charter A dumb error said Mr Koch of Mr Lamberti whom he has endorsed for election The Mayor said his view did not demonstrate a lack of confidence in Mr McGinley A grand jury later yesterday found no cause for indictment  Only Miss Bellamy said she opposed the construction of a Staten Island naval base for ships that could carry nuclear weapons This isnt a maintenance of military power this is a buildup Miss Bellamy said as she argued that Federal aid to cities had been drastically cut in favor of a dramatic building up of the military power in this country The Mayor who is running for a third term closed the debate by raising the possibility of serving even a fourth term if he is up to it But Miss Bellamy had the last word sotto voce when she said Sounds like an announcement

COURT BACKS PLAN TO LIMIT ABORTION COUNSELING,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/26/us/court-backs-plan-to-limit-abortion-counseling.html,Reagan Administration officials said today that they wanted Congress to forbid abortion counseling by family planning clinics that receive Federal money The proposed restrictions would also forbid such clinics from referring women to abortion clinics Under current Federal rules family planning clinics that receive Federal aid must offer both abortion counseling and referral services to pregnant women who ask about their options The Administration disclosed its position at a crucial time in the debate over family planning just as groups opposed to abortion are urging Congress to end or severely cut back the Federal family planning program Authority for the program established in 1970 expires Nov 15 Representative Jack Kemp of upstate New York and Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah both Republicans have offered identical proposals to assure that if the program is continued no Federal money may be used for abortion counseling or referrals Administration Backs Plan Jo Ann Gasper Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services said today that the Administration supported the KempHatch initiative Under the proposal she said family planning clinics would have to change their programs or do without Federal money The program distributed 1425 million to 4000 clinics last year Planned Parenthood whose affiliates received 30 million of that total has been prominent among those opposing the KempHatch proposal A lot of people would like to get the money but have problems with the current abortion counseling and referral requirements Mrs Gasper said Those people would be delighted to step forward and provide the services if Planned Parenthood clinics gave up the Federal money she said New Visibility for Kemp Mr Kemp said his proposal was designed to put a wall of separation between family planning and abortion But William W Hamilton Jr director of the Washington office of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said it would adversely affect almost every family planning clinic because it is impossible to operate a medically ethical program without telling pregnant women about their full range of options including abortion Mr Kemp has consistently opposed abortion but his speeches on tax and monetary policy have tended to overshadow his interest in social issues Republican strategists said his role in the debate over family planning might help him in his quest for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1988 by demonstrating the strength of his conservative credentials on abortion The KempHatch proposal states that no Federal funds may be used to provide to any pregnant woman abortion procedures counseling for abortion procedures or referral for abortion procedures unless the life of the mother would be endangered by carrying the fetus to term Scott R Swirling executive director of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association which represents the 4000 clinics receiving Federal money said his group was absolutely opposed to this restriction It would destroy the family planning program Mr Swirling said No professional or ethical healthcare provider could comply with the provisions of the KempHatch proposal Title X of the Public Health Service Act the legal authority for the program provides financing for family planning and research but forbids using Federal money to pay for abortions Senator Hatch said Title X was intended to provide services to lowincome families but was actually a safesex program for unmarried adolescents including many children of affluent parents They qualified he said because of a Federal rule that said clinics must not count parents financial resources when unemancipated minors sought services on a confidential basis
"JUSTICE STEVENS, IN RARE CRITICISM, DISPUTES MEESE ON CONSTITUTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/26/us/justice-stevens-in-rare-criticism-disputes-meese-on-constitution.html,Associate Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court in a speech made public today offered a pointbypoint rebuttal of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3ds views on some major constitutional issues Justice Stevens said Mr Meese offered a somewhat incomplete account of history to support his suggestion that the Supreme Court has erred in applying provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states He also criticized Mr Meeses statements about the separation of church and state Several legal experts said today that it was the first time they could recall that a member of the Court made a speech criticizing a sitting Attorney General by name CourtPacking Defeat Analyzed In another speech made public today Associate Justice William H Rehnquist whose conservative views are regarded as closer to Mr Meeses than are those of any other member of the Court analyzed the defeat of Franklin D Roosevelts plan to pack the Court in 1937 The analysis had conservatives debating what message if any Justice Rehnquist was sending to Mr Meese and other conservative critics of the Court The two speeches were part of an extraordinary public debate between the Administration and members of the Court that has evolved since July when the Attorney General said the Constitutions framers would find recent Court decisions on religion bizarre Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr in a speech Oct 12 that did not mention Mr Meese by name assailed the view of the Constitution that the Attorney General had expounded as little more than arrogance cloaked as humility The remarks by Justice Brennan perhaps the Courts most liberal member were similar in some respects to those released today by Justice Stevens who is regarded as a moderate and something of a maverick Justice Stevens stressed that unlike Mr Meese no Justice who has sat on the Supreme Court during the past 60 years has questioned the applicability of the First Amendment to state governments Some conservative legal scholars here speculated that Justice Rehnquist was hinting in his speech that Mr Meese and other conservatives should tone down their criticisms of the Court lest they produce undesired results by antagonizing the more moderate and liberal Justices Others disagreed Terry Eastland the Justice Departments chief spokesman said it was unclear whether Justice Rehnquist intended any message at all but that at most he was hinting that the majority of the current Court now in their 70s could not last forever and that legislative efforts to curb the courts might be inadvisable Time Is on Your Side Justice Rehnquist asserted that the Courtpacking plan in which President Roosevelt attacked the antiNew Deal majority of the Supreme Court and urged Congress unsuccessfully to expand the Courts membership so that he could appoint six additional Justices had proved quite unnecessary Had Franklin Roosevelt but heeded the advice of Senator Henry Ashurst before the Courtpacking plan was ever devised that Father Time with his scythe is on your side  Justice Rehnquist said he would have in the normal course of events been able to largely remake the Supreme Court In fact he noted Roosevelt did remake the Court producing a proNew Deal majority after several Justices retired or died Justice Rehnquist did not say whether he intended his account of this constitutional morality play to carry any message of contemporary relevance Five of the Courts current nine members including its three most liberal are 76 years of age or older Justice Rehnquist is 61 Conservative Change Expected Conservatives in and out of the Administration have expressed hope that President Reagan will have a chance to replace some of the current Justices with conservatives who would overrule some of the Courts precedents including its 1973 decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion The Supreme Courts press office released an advance copy of Justice Rehnquists remarks which he was to deliver this evening at the University of Wyoming Law School Justice Stevens gave his speech from rough notes Wednesday in Chicago at a Federal Bar Association luncheon closed to the press The press office today released a text that the Justice had prepared after giving the speech He rebuked in particular Mr Meeses suggestion on July 9 that the Court had gone astray in a succession of rulings since 1925 that the states as well as the Federal Government must not violate the liberties enumerated in the First Amendment and most other provisions of the Bill of Rights Justice Stevens said the development of Mr Meeses argument is somewhat incomplete because its concentration on the original intention of the framers of the Bill of Rights overlooks the importance of subsequent events in the development of our law In particular he added it overlooks the profound importance of the Civil War and the postwar amendments on the structure of our government and particularly upon the relationship between the Federal Government and the separate states He then took issue with Mr Meeses suggestion that the Courts rulings that the Constitution demands strict neutrality between religion and irreligion would have struck the founding generation as bizarre A Broad and Diverse Class Asserting that the term founding generation describes a rather broad and diverse class Justice Stevens added I am not at all sure that men like James Madison Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin or the pamphleteer Thomas Paine would have regarded strict neutrality on the part of religion and irreligion as bizarre  Justice Stevens was the author of the Courts decision last June striking down an Alabama law that the Court said amounted to unconstitutional state sponsorship of school prayer Mr Eastland the Justice Department spokesman said Mr Meese was out of town and would not be available for comment In response to Justice Stevenss speech Mr Eastland said If Justice Stevens is saying that the intentions of the framers are unknowable he must then answer the question which he does not raise of what courts should be guided by in their interpretations of the Constitution The problem is that too often judges have been guided by their own policy preferences not the written Constitution

IDEAS & TRENDS;   Reagan Backs Abortion Limit,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/27/weekinreview/ideas-trends-reagan-backs-abortion-limit.html,President Reagan has disappointed some supporters who say his Administrations efforts against abortion have not matched the determination of his speeches But Federal officials vowed action last week saying they would press Congress to forbid abortion counseling and referrals by federally financed familyplanning clinics The announcement came at a crucial time on Capitol Hill authority for the Federal familyplanning program runs out Nov 15 Representative Jack Kemp of upstate New York and Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah both Republicans have offered identical proposals to assure that if the program is continued no Federal money can be used for abortion counseling Mr Kemp said his proposal would put a wall of separation between family planning and abortion Today clinics that receive Federal aid must offer pregnant women abortion counseling and referrals Planned Parenthood whose affiliates received 30 million of the 1425 million given out under the program last year said the KempHatch proposal would adversely affect the clinics because it is impossible to operate a medically ethical program without telling pregnant women about their full range of options including abortion
SURVIVING THE DEATH OF AN INFANT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/27/nyregion/surviving-the-death-of-an-infant.html,GALE KALECHOFSKY of Massapequa remembers how quietly the nurse came into her hospital room cradling the pink receiving blanket Can I hold her she asked Sure the nurse responded Mrs Kalechofsky opened her arms and cuddled her daughter sobbing She pushed the blanket away from her daughters face and stared down at her looking to catch a family resemblance Then she undraped the entire blanket and saw the marks around the babys neck The umbilical cord had strangled the child to death The experience of losing her child Mrs Kalechofsky said was like a bad dream and left her and her husband devastated for months In the past medicine often downplayed or virtually ignored a womans loss of a child during pregnancy A miscarriage was dismissed easily because the loss was only an embryo and a stillborn child was quickly whisked away to avoid upsetting the woman further But in the last few years doctors nurses and medical groups have come to realize that this attitude is at odds with a couples need to grieve Parents love for their children begins long before birth said Vicki Colburn a national faculty member of the Nurses Association of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology Some women fantasize their children all the way up through being grandmothers so its not uncommon for a couple who have lost a child to feel as if theyve lost a part of their future If we dont let them grieve properly she added theyll develop coping mechanisms that are counterproductive to normal living such as anger and depression But we can help resolve their grief by offering them choices Lois Fink a clinical nurse specialist in obstetrics at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park used to tell couples that she was sorry for their loss but not to worry because they would have another child But they never did forget the child they lost she said Instead they carried around a grotesque picture of their baby in their minds forever Now Miss Fink and other nurses practicing as part of perinatal bereavement teams which have become increasingly common in Long Island hospitals offer couples the option of seeing their dead baby While it may be shocking holding a dead baby can stir someone into reality Miss Fink said According to Dr Milton Viederman a professor of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan The idea of seeing a dead child and holding it undercuts any unconscious fantasy that a baby didnt really die Similarly according to Miss Fink planning a funeral for a stillborn child can acknowledge the importance of its life no matter how short it was and provide an opportunity for family and friends to grieve with the parents Mementos of the baby  a set of footprints a photograph or a lock of hair  can also help a couple remember their child So can naming it she said But the key to changing how couples cope with pregnancy loss is to approach these alternatives with caution said Dr Ngaere Baxter clinical service director of the Foundation for Depression and Manic Depression in Manhattan Some women will have formed an attachment to the children they have lost and they will grieve for them according to Dr Baxter But others have not developed so much of an attachment so asking them to hold a baby identify a baby etc would in fact be asking them to let go of something theyve not developed an identification with in the first place And since pregnancy and the postpartum period are known to be stress periods for depression according to Dr Baxter such suggestions should not be offered to a woman without fully exploring her emotional needs For Mrs Kalechofsky who is 30 years old the news that her daughter was dead was shocking I had had such a normal pregnancy she said But three days past my due date all of a sudden my baby stopped moving The worst went through my head but I didnt expect Jennifer to be dead For her support initially came from her physician who comforted her by holding her hand and allowing her to cry on his shoulder Then he explained what had happened According to Dr Adiel Fleischer chief of fetal maternal medicine at Long Island Jewish Were using a lot more understanding and more sympathy with our patients who lose a child at any stage of pregnancy Not only do we try to make them feel emotionally better but we take time to explain to them what really happened so we can dissipate any guilt they may have One out of every four or five pregnancies ends in a miscarriage known clinically as a spontaneous abortion Dr Fleischer said They usually cannot be prevented or corrected In addition two out of every 100 babies are stillborn In some cases death is caused by a mothers uncontrolled hypertension But doctors have no control over a child becoming entangled in its umbilical cord Even after Mrs Kalechofsky who lost her child two years ago was told by her physician how the baby died and she had a chance to say goodbye to her she felt she needed more help I would call my husband every day at work and ramble on for an hour recalled Mrs Kalechofsky who has two other children Only a very select number of people were able to just let me talk Most of our friends had had enough I think they kept away from us because they feared our tragedy could happen to them The help and compassion of others who have had similar experiences can be invaluable in helping parents realize that their grief is normal according to Sister Marjorie Aidan Fahey of the pastoral care department at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre Mrs Kalechofsy said she can still hear her mothers voice crying What when Mrs Kalechofsy told her that her granddaughter had been stillborn Frequently a couple that has lost a child feels they have cheated the prospective grandparents said Jane Memolo a psychiatric nurse at Mercy Hospital and a consultant to their bereavement group which hold a series of encounter sessions unique on Long Island They take it personally and are overridden with guilt she went on And some of that guilt does come from mom Sharing these emotions with others can help place them in a proper perspective This guilt is more pervasive among suburbanites than in bigger cities according to Eileen Mitchell a psychotherapist with the division of human reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset Family pressure is far greater in Nasssu than in Manhattan where I also practice she said People who live in the suburbs are more family oriented there are lots of houses with kids on the block and they also live closer to their parents Therefore becoming parents and sharing grandchildren with their parents becomes more important If these couples lose a baby she went on the loss is very great and counseling is essential Too often far more attention is paid to the mother than the father during a pregnancy loss according to Sister Aidan Erwin Doyle of Hicksville recalled his anguish as he walked alongside his wife Cathy after she was wheeled from the delivery room two years ago She had just delivered a stillborn son that they had loved wanted dreamt about and prayed for Mrs Doyle said And now all the expectant and new fathers they passed were shouting Whatd you have Mr Doyle said he felt awful but he did not want to ruin the mood of the other fathers so he kept his anger to himself  until he accompanied his wife to Mercys bereavement group In the beginning I felt I had to be strong he recalled But as I listened to the other husbands in the group talking I realized that there was no reason that I had to be macho It was all right to cry Such group sessions can also be helpful in instructing a couple in how to deal with other children who dont understand what happened and are afraid that they too may die Miss Fink the nurse at Long Island Jewish said she had noticed one more difference in couples that go through group bereavement sessions It used to be that if a couple had a pregnancy loss at one hospital they would shop around for another hospital when they got pregnant again she said But weve found that if we ease the pain of a couples pregnancy loss by being supportive and caring theyll not only come back to the hospital again they may send us a thankyou note She remembers one note in particular that said Even though our baby died thanks for helping us through it

Dangers of Calling History to the Witness Stand,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/27/opinion/l-dangers-of-calling-history-to-the-witness-stand-110619.html,To the Editor There is eminent authority for the view by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d that the Constitution should be interpreted in accord with the intent of its framers For example Justice Hugo Black eloquently championed that theory of constitutional interpretation in his dissenting opinion in Adamson v California 332 US 46 8992 1947 and in his concurring opinion in Duncan v Louisiana 391 US 145 162 1968 A major difficulty however is that there is no consensus among historians and legal scholars on the original understanding of many of the provisions of the Constitution To the contrary there is profound disagreement on many issues Which historians should we follow One of the most searching scholarly inquiries of the last 50 years into the understanding of the Constitution in 1787 was that of Prof William Winslow Crosskey of the University of Chicago Law School whose twovolume work on the subject Politics and the Constitution was published in 1953 Professor Crosskeys study provoked intense controversy It was acclaimed by some authorities as a great scholarly contribution but it was vehemently criticized by other constitutional scholars Mr Crosskey concluded among other things that the Founding Fathers intended to establish a fully empowered national government in which the states would occupy minor and subordinate roles that Congress was vested with complete power to regulate all of the nations commerce including intrastate trade that the Bill of Rights was intended to apply to both the states and the national Government and that the Supreme Court was to have only limited power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional I doubt very much that Attorney General Meese would accept Professor Crosskeys views of the original understanding Suppose that someone were to discover a longlost cache of records of the Federal Constitutional Convention of 1787 that demonstrated beyond question that certain provisions of the Constitution were meant by the framers to be understood in a manner profoundly different from todays accepted views Would advocates of the originalintention theory of constitutional interpretation abandon longaccepted principles of government and renounce their deeply felt opinions even on the basis of the most persuasive historical evidence The point is that history is invoked in constitutionallaw litigation and debates as a rationalization or justification for theories of the Constitution that an advocate wishes to defend for other reasons As George Santayana once observed history is a sort of retrospective politics engaged in as one might look over a crowd to find his friends Scholarly investigation into the original understanding of the Constitution is important and worthwhile and should be encouraged In the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes History sets us free and enables us to make up our minds dispassionately However history alone cannot determine our political preferences History can show us a number of things as one of our foremost constitutionallaw scholars Prof Paul Freund has perceptively noted but when history is called on to furnish a guide to the priority of values it may be given a burden heavier than it can bear alone Ones views on such complex issues as churchstate relations abortion and the rights of accused persons may be supported by history but history does not compel a particular conclusionABE KRASH Washington Oct 18 1985 The writer is a lawyer

SUPREME COURT;   ADMINISTRATION TROLLING FOR CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/28/us/supreme-court-administration-trolling-for-constitutional-debate.html,Recent history has seen nothing quite like the rhetorical crossfire between Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and two members of the Supreme Court Speeches by Associate Justices John Paul Stevens last week and William J Brennan Jr Oct 12 dramatized the concern provoked in the Courts marble edifice by the Administrations drive to change the course of constitutional law Since the defeat of Franklin D Roosevelts courtpacking plan in 1937 it has been rare for top executive branch officials to assail the Supreme Court directly And it has been virtually unheard of for members of the Court off the bench to criticize the constitutional views of top executive branch officials Justices Wary of Tangling Because much of the Courts authority rests on its appearance of Olympian detachment and impartiality Justices have traditionally been wary of debate on politically charged issues This tradition is eroding The latest salvo came today when Terry H Eastland the Justice Departments top spokesman echoed a deprecating phrase Justice Stevens had lobbed at Mr Meese last week His argument is somewhat incomplete Mr Eastland said of Justice Stevens He said Justice Stevens in criticizing Mr Meeses approach to interpreting the Constitution had failed to specify an alternative Too often judges have been guided by their own personal views rather than by what the people have agreed to in statutes and the Constitution Mr Eastland said Meese and Bennett Began It The debate started this summer with sharp critiques by Mr Meese and Education Secretary William J Bennett of recent Supreme Court decisions on religion and other issues Mr Meese has assailed recent decisions such as the one written by Justice Stevens in June which barred school prayer in Alabama as well as older precedents such as the 1966 decision requiring the police to inform arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and have a lawyer the Miranda decision But the debate transcends crime abortion and other specific controversies It reaches to the heart of the the courts rolein the United States in restraining majority rule Justices Stevens and Brennan while muting their messages have made it clear that they have a low opinion of Mr Meeses understanding of basic constitutional issues Meese Was Rebuked on Views Justice Stevenss speech began with an offthecuff account of how the Justices spend their summer recess But he included a rebuttal of an address July 9 in which Mr Meese outlined his conservative views on constitutional law Several scholars said this was the first speech they could recall in which a Justice had rebuked a sitting Attorney General by name Justice Stevens disputed Mr Meeses suggestions that the Court had erred in applying the Bill of Rights to the states his arguments that the Court should hew closely to the views of the framers in construing the Constitution and his criticisms of the Courts enforcement of strict separation of church and state Justice Stevens said of Mr Meeses suggestion that the Court had erred in applying the First Amendment to the states The development of his argument is somewhat incomplete Impact of Civil War Cited He said that Mr Meese had failed to mention the profound importance of the Civil War and subsequent constitutional amendments and the fact that no Justice who has sat on the Supreme Court in the last 60 years had questioned that states must honor First Amendment freedoms Justice Brennan in a speech Oct 12 dismissed as little more than arrogance cloaked as humility the view that decisions on the meaning of the Constitution should be based on the original intention of the men who wrote it He did not mentioned Mr Meese or his call July 9 for a jurisprudence of original intention But scorn for the school of thought that Mr Meese has brought to prominence was palpable in Justice Brennans suggestion that the chorus of lamentations calling for interpretation faithful to original intention  and proposing nullification of interpretations that fail this quick litmus test  must inevitably come from persons who have no familiarity with the historical record Rehnquist on Roosevelt Not since the Courtpacking plan when Roosevelt gave what Justice William H Rehnquist depicted in a speech on Friday as a ripsnorting oration assailing the Court for striking down New Deal legislation has the executive branch directed so much criticism at the Court The current debate does not match 1937s in intensity The Court has not been a major obstruction to the Administrations program And President Reagan has neither used harsh rhetoric against the Court since he took office nor called for anything like the Roosevelt plan to reverse its orientation by expanding it But even when the Courts institutional integrity was under attack in 1937 the only direct response was a strategically timed statement in which three Justices disputed the Presidents contention that the Court needed new members to keep up with its caseload They avoided airing their constitutional disagreements with Roosevelt Administration Is Pleased While members of the Court have become more vocal off the bench in recent years they have generally confined themselves to specialized subjects such as their caseload or to revoicing jibes at one another already enshrined in dissents Mr Meese Mr Eastland and other conservative critics are pleased that Justices Brennan and Stevens have helped give prominence to the Administrations challenge Conservatives hope Mr Reagan will be able to name new Justices who will move the law sharply to the right They seek to prepare public opinion for reconsideration of constitutional principles once hotly debated that time and the accumulation of precendent seem to have etched in stone Mr Eastlands first reaction to the Stevens speech was to observe with evident delight its remarkable whats started here Today he added We believe a thorough airing of these issues that have often gone unexamined is needed
4 IN NASSAU RACE DIFFER SHARPLY CONCERNING LILCO,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/29/nyregion/4-in-nassau-race-differ-sharply-concerning-lilco.html,The four candidates for Nassau County Executive clashed yesterday over the role of county government in the management of the Long Island Lighting Company the future of the utilitys nuclear power plant and political contributions by county employees During a onehour debate at The New York Times Francis T Purcell the Republican incumbent and his Democratic challenger John W Matthews were cordial but on several occasions they engaged in heated verbal sparring They agreed only that they did not approve of the way Lilco was being managed but they differed sharply on whether the county government should force a replacement of the top officers at the utility The Liberal Party candidate Jack Olchin said he strongly supported the Shoreham nuclear plant while Dr Raymond J Vuolo of the Right to Life Party said the importance of the issue had been exaggerated Utility Widely Criticized The utility has come under increased criticism from the public for its high rates long delays in the construction of a nuclear generating plant at Shoreham and its recent handling of the extensive damages caused by Hurricane Gloria which left many customers without power for several days Mr Purcell said he felt there were a lot of things that have to be corrected at Lilco But as far as taking it over he said theres a very big and serious problem Mr Purcell who has been County Executive for seven and a half years and is seeking reelection to a third term noted that Lilco paid about 200 million a year in taxes  125 million to Suffolk County and 75 million to Nassau County If there was a public takeover it would probably mean this would be off the tax roll he said Mr Matthews a 48yearold insulation contractor said he would like to see the Shoreham plant refitted as a coalburning generating plant He also said he wanted an immediate change in mananagement at the utility He recalled that he recently had purchased 100 shares of preferred Lilco stock which he said gave him the right to call for a special election to replace Lilcos board of directors Under the utilitys bylaws any holder of preferred stock can request a special shareholders meeting to elect a majority of the board once the company fails to pay four quarterly dividends Lilco stopped paying preferred dividends on Oct 1 1984 and missed its fourth consecutive quarterly dividend July 1 The utility has responded by filing a suit to block Mr Matthewss challenge Dr Vuolo dismissed Shoreham as an issue that had been taken and blown out of all proportion Abortion Issue Raised It isnt the function of the County Executive to want to replace or not replace the leadership of Lilco said Dr Vuolo a physician Referring to abortion he asserted that the most important issue in thiscampaign is the fact that innocent human lives are being taken every single day through the country and particularly in Nassau County Mr Olchin noted that his party had not taken a position on the Shoreham plant but that he was personally very strongly in favor of opening Shoreham Mr Purcell who has long advocated the opening of the Shoreham plant noted that there were 75 nuclear plants operating in the country and they are stabilizing rates in different areas I think Shoreham should go on line he said The management is something else If Mr Matthews can change the management more power to him Reaching for Straw But I am not going to change it and John Matthews is not going to change it Mr Purcell continued He charged that his opponent was reaching for the straw to change the world by buying 100 shares of stock in Lilco Two days after the election John Matthews will disappear into the wisp of the wind like he did four years ago Mr Purcell said Mr Matthews quickly retorted Thats beneath you Mr Purcell to talk like that Mr Matthews ran as the Democrat candidate against Mr Purcell four years ago and lost by 93000 votes Kickback Trial Cited The issue of Lilco dominated discussion for nearly half the hourlong debate then shifted to the socalled 1 percent case a classaction suit heard in August in Federal District Court in Uniondale LI A sixmember jury found that the Nassau County Republican Committee and the Town of Hempstead had coerced some past and present municipal employees to kick back 1 percent of their salaries to the party to get pay increases and promotions Mr Purcell acknowledged there were some mistakes made in the Town of Hempstead  theres no doubt about it But he insisted that the 1 percent case has been stretched out of proportion Mr Olchin introduced a piece of Democratic campaign literature that he charged distorted the intent of the 1 percent trial The campaign flier urges voters to apply to the Nassau County Republican Commitee headquarters in Westbury LI for a taxpayers refund on the 1 percent kickbacks The flier says Please refund to me 1 percent of my tax bills for the past 10 years representing part of the increase in taxes that I have been forced to pay due to the illegal 1 percent kickback of public employees coerced by the Nassau GOP Mr Olchin a deputy county attorney tossed a copy of the flier on the table in front of Mr Matthews charging that it was deceptive The average person that gets this piece of literature will be deceived by it into thinking that theyre entitled to 1 percent of their tax bill Mr Olchin said A Heated Exchange Mr Matthews defended the flier and charged that Mr Olchin was the Liberal Party candidate with the approval of the Republican Party Mr Olchin then challenged Mr Matthews to sign one of his own taxpayer refund applications Mr Matthews picked up a pen from the table and with a flourish signed his name Mr Matthews then turned to Mr Purcell and demanded Why did you never publicly say that the 1 percent was immoral It was immoral Say it No said Mr Purcell his voice rising I didnt say it was immoral and I dont say what you recommend that I say

whole sections of Ferraro that read like outtakes from an official campaign biography or a speech to Democractic Party supporters There are gracious thankyou notes written to Tip ONeill and Bella Abzug cordial assessments of other VicePresidential hopefuls and careful summaries of the authors stands on various issues  from womens rights to Central America to Social Security Facts and statistics ie In this country 28 million women over the age of sixtyfive lived in poverty are mustered to underscore points in the party platform and cliched phrases History was being made And every woman there was a part of it are invoked in an attempt to conjure up again the emotion of the convention Yet if such passages make for less than compelling reading they are somewhat expected in a book of this kind Whether or not Mrs Ferraro decides to run for a United States Senate seat next year she has made it clear that she plans to continue to play a public role in national politics and given this determination she is hardly in a position to write a tell all book The memoir form also creates a further measure of awkwardness statements dealing say with her historic candidacy Never has a political candidacy drawn so much curiosity  and rarely so many enthusiasts might well sound like straightforward observation in the voice of another writer as expressed by the candidate herself however they tend to take on the selfcongratulatory tone of someone on the stump For all these weaknesses Ferraro remains all in all a pleasantly readable and at times informative book We do learn that Mrs Ferraro was asked a year before the convention to serve as chairman of the Mondale campaign  a role she declined We learn that she initially thought John Glenn would be her partys Presidential nominee We learn that she asked Mr Mondale to drop her name from consideration as his running mate so angered was she by nasty rumors that were being leaked about her by members of his camp And we learn that a small group of women who called themselves Team A had spent a good year before the election trying to advance the concept of a female Vice President In the course of chronicling her experiences during the campaign Mrs Ferraro retraces all the highlights familiar to even the most casual followers of the news  the jubilant convention the controversy over the finances of her husband John Zaccaro the clash over abortion and free choice with Archbishop John J OConnor and the debate with Vice President Bush Also replayed for readers are such incidents as the Blueberry Muffin Showdown Can you bake a blueberry muffin asked the Mississippi agriculture commissioner I sure can she replied Can you and the Flower Controversy In no way was I going to deny my femininity during the campaign she said explaining that she loved receiving flowers though she drew the line at wrist corsages which would make her look like someone going to a prom It is on the more personal aspects of running for Vice President that Mrs Ferraro is most candid amusing and moving Her determination to go on wearing shortsleeved dresses in the face of advice to dress in businesslike suits her decision to shake hands firmly with supporters instead of settling for the fingersqueezing of veteran campaigners her studying of old Jimmy Stewart movies in an attempt to slow down her rapidfire speech her attempts to fend off reporters intent on finding out whether she cried after reading a story assailing her late fathers reputation these are the scenes that ultimately stay in the readers mind after finishing this book Underlying all the anecdotes of course is the story of the consequences that Mrs Ferraros candidacy had on her family and her own psyche And though she repeatedly talks of the pride she felt as the first woman on a major partys national ticket there is a subtext of anger hurt and disillusion to her tale She was unprepared she says for the depth of the fury the bigotry and the sexism my candidacy would unleash and she worried about the campaigns cruel personal toll She worried that her husband was sinking into a deep depression over the investigations into his business dealings she worried that her three children would be hurt by the heckling and public denouncements and she worried that under the stress of campaigning  besides dealing with various emotional issues she was flying in and out of as many as five states a day  her own life seemed to be spinning out of control She says she knew that there was no way to pull out of the campaign No one was ever going to be able to say that under pressure a woman would fall apart but that by the end shed begun to wish that the whole thing would simply be over because of what it was doing to my family In the end such statements tell us a good deal more about Geraldine Ferraro as a woman and a politician than all the tired footage in this book devoted to reviewing old speeches and familiar issues One only wishes that Mrs Ferraro had elaborated on such matters further offering her own thoughts on what it was like as a woman to be involved in the campaign instead of rehashing others meditations on what her presence meant to American women in general
Bad Counseling for Poor Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/31/opinion/bad-counseling-for-poor-women.html,Since 1970 millions of poor women have turned to the 4000 clinics receiving funds under the Federal familyplanning program for advice about contraceptives pregnancy tests and abortion counseling The program has saved those women much pain anguish and ignorance It has also saved the Government extensive health and welfare costs associated with unintended births The amount of pain anguish and ignorance and cost  will soon be going up if Representative Jack Kemp the New York Republican and Senator Orrin Hatch Republican of Utah have their way Poor women would be denied access to much of the knowledge they need to make informed choices about family planning The KempHatch proposal which is backed by the Administration would deny Federal funds to clinics that give abortion counseling so as to erect in Mr Kemps language a wall of separation between family planning and abortion But no federally funded familyplanning clinics provide or recommend abortions They do what all licensed healthcare providers should do inform the pregnant woman that abortion is a legal option If asked they will make a referral By providing women with contraceptive counseling the clinics have prevented countless abortions This bill would render them much less able to do so How can a woman choose responsibly among contraceptives if she isnt told that some far from dependable are recommended only with abortion backup Should Congress pass the KempHatch bill clinics that insist on informing women about all their medical options would lose substantial amounts Theyd be punished in other words for behaving ethically But the clinics patients would be punished most of all  for being poor The remedy when the Federal familyplanning program comes up soon for reauthorization is for Congress to scrap this cruel and discriminatory amendment
KEAN'S STRATEGY FOR FOR ANOTHER TERM: MAKING THE 'NICE GUY' FINISH FIRST,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/31/nyregion/kean-s-strategy-for-for-another-term-making-the-nice-guy-finish-first.html,To begin the word along the hustings seems true Tom Kean really is a nice guy Even his most ardent critics give him that He is the kind of man who stops a parade just so one of the local youngsters carrying his banner can tie a loose shoelace He is the kind of man who turns to a harried press aide and thanks him for simply doing his job He is nice to archbishops and ironworkers alike He is so courteous so full of bonhomie that his public persona almost dwarfs the issues in his campaign for reelection as the Governor of New Jersey In short by design and by nature he practices the politics of being a nice guy And yet he is the most private of men an enigma outside the circle of politicians and reporters and acquaintances who track him When he reveals himself he does so slowly Personal Concerns Still even a man with a wide smile has his dark moments and even a selfassured politician can be filled with doubts Not long ago for instance the Governor was ready to give up his job It was in January in a hotel room out of town his chief of staff and longtime friend Gregory C Stevens recalled I was trying to get him to sit down and talk with me one to one about running for reelection I said Tom weve got to make certain decisions here He said Greg right now I dont want to run I was devastated After three and a half years working nights and weekends and going county fairs folk festivals budget briefings and political wrangles Mr Kean wondered about the cost of public life You dont get a chance to pursue your hobbies your friendships and most importantly you give up time with your family the Governor said during a recent interview I knew if I was successful with reelection it would be eight years giving up time with my family By that time my twin sons would be through with college and my daughter shes 11 well those are important years for a youngster Politics vs Teaching But in the end it was the members of the family who dispelled his doubts They said You know youll be miserable to live with around here if you dont run  In truth this 50yearold scion of wealth and privilege has always been torn between his legacy which is politics and his prediliction which is teaching His father served in the House of Representatives and his great uncle and grandfather were United States Senators  all from New Jersey The familys fortune was built on interests in banks public utilities and real estate After taking a degree in history at Princeton University he taught at St Marks School a private academy he attended in Southborough Mass In the early 1960s he began work on a doctorate in history and education at Columbia University but left school to work in the presidential campaign of William W Scranton the former Governor of Pennsylvania Close Race Against Florio In 1967 the same year he married Deborah Elizabeth Bye he won a seat in the State Assembly and served in that house for 10 years at one point as the Speaker He has lost two elections a bid for Congress in 1974 and his first attempt at the Governors office during the Republican primary in 1977 In the 1981 gubernatorial election he slipped into the State House past the Democrat Representative James J Florio by 1797 votes Today opinion polls have him leading his current Democratic challenger Peter Shapiro by as much as 51 points And this extraordinary preelection advantage this metamorphosis from an almost alsoran into a candidate who now might bring others with him on his coattails has been built in some measure on his personality Mr Stevens who worked for Mr Kean in 1977 and rejoined him in 1983 has been the Governors political cartographer mapping out a strategy that moved Mr Kean away from moribund office duties and the minutiae of government out into the field to meet his constituents Tom Kean is outgoing Mr Stevens said so when I came here I said we have to let the public get to know this man Using His Best Asset In part this was also an attempt to circumvent a Legislature controlled by the opposition party but in Mr Stevenss view he was simply putting to use this particular politicians best political asset Ive worked for politicians I used to worry about on the stump he said You never knew what they were going to say or do I never worry about that in Tom Keans case Hes a good politician but he doesnt appear to be a politician and thats helpful And what did the public see at all those picnics and ethnic festivals and town meetings he has gone to during the last three years They saw a stable leader which is what people want said Allan Marcus the head of his own publicrelations firm who was a staff aide in the Legislature during Mr Keans time in the Assembly Here was a man who doesnt raise his voice who doesnt yell who doesnt lecture Even his opponents who often rail against his policies in private give the Governor his due A Legendary Indifference Alan Karcher a Democrat and as Assembly Speaker one of Mr Keans harshest critics says on the one hand that the Governor likes to be liked and will not take stands on tough issues that use up his political capital Then he quickly adds I personally like him Hes a wonderful guy to have a cup of coffee with If Mr Kean is concerned about his personal image he does little to show it In fact his indifference to it all is part of the Kean legend On the stump the other day his white buttondown oxford shirt was badly frayed at the front of the collar I remember once Mr Stevens said during his first campaign for Governor in 1977 he had this Burmese mountain dog a big dog and it would put its paws on Toms shoulders and it drooled so all this saliva and dog hair would run down him He didnt care He just walked out the door Then there are the stories about Tom Kean the pinchfist A man of wealth  his holdings are now in a blind trust but in 1981 his net worth was estimated near 2 million  he has the reputation in government and at home of being able to wring a dollar dry You mean Im cheap he said proudly One Can of Balls The keeper of these stories is Philip D Kaltenbacher chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey a classmate of Mr Kean in the Legislature in the early 1970s and now a friend and tennis partner Story No 1 the tennis balls At the start of every tennis season his father would make a great ceremony about opening the can of balls The same balls were used for the entire season By Labor Day they only bounced an inch or two Tom has loosened up a little He came up with used tennis balls recently that still had some fuzz on them Story No 2 the shoes Its not true that Tom Kean has only one pair of shoes That story is exaggerated by 100 percent He has two pairs of shoes and one of them has deep ruts in them Story No 3 the suits I know for a fact he owns two suits Theres the blue one and the glen plaid Im not so sure he didnt inherit them though The Governor usually begins his day around 7 AM at the family estate in Livingston He checks with his aides by telephone to see what is ahead then is driven to work in a stateowned fourdoor Cadillac sedan He works from a briefcase on the back seat A Hybrid Philosophy He rarely looses his temper his aides say but when he does it is usually in the privacy of Mr Stevenss office Greg said one campaign aide is the man who falls on Toms grenades As a statesman Mr Kean has fashioned his own hybrid philosophy He is at the core a modern conservative and free marketeer with a touch of liberalism On economics he said I believe in the private sector Thats where the wealth comes from not government I believe that taxes are retrogressive in the creation of wealth I believe government should be squeezed But when President Reagan began to cut social programs Mr Kean broke with the Administration and was sharply critical of many of the cuts You dont have to be a mother on welfare to understand as I did he said that youve got to raise the money those people are getting for them to have any kind of a chance of life in the future for them and their children Ambiguity on 2 Issues He supports and has worked for the passage of the equal rights amendment again breaking with the conservatives And he said he was pleased with New Jerseys guncontrol laws among the toughest in the nation On two other issues however he seems to equivocate He is personally opposed to abortion and in favor of allowing prayer in the public schools he said But he continued the Constitution protects the former and disallows the latter and as Governor he is bound to uphold the law He signed a bill to reinstate the death penalty in New Jersey but said I wish I didnt feel the way I do I came to the conclusion some time ago that capital punishment is going to save some lives if criminals know theyre going to forfeit their own life he explained As a politician he sees himself as a trench fighter I think anyone who has ever run against me for office will tell you I can be as contentious as the next guy he said But he continued I dont believe that confrontation leads to compromise Democratic legislators like Senator Raymond Lesniak of Elizabeth said the Governor stays above the fray the dirty work and sends his political operatives into the aisles to lobby the Legislature Tennis and Tolstoy As a candidate he is a campaign managers delight  energetic amiable eager to shake just one last hand give one last hug speak one more line In part said Mr Kean the campaign gives him an excuse to flee Trenton and what he calls the incestuous inspeak of the capital He is a reasonably fit man 6 feet 1 inch 180 pounds a fan of baseball and football a tennis player who hugs the baseline and likes to slice the ball or whip it across court At one point the tennis player was sidelined Early in his first term he suffered a back injury and spent three weeks in traction I got more mail while I was on my back  letters with suggestions and remedies than about anything else since Ive been Governor he said He tries to read a book a week and prefers biographies and historical novels In this vein his favorite book is Tolstoys War and Peace He likes the Washington Redskins from his days when his father was in Congress the New York Giants they play in New Jersey Yogi Berra and Bruce Springsteen the former lives in the state the latter was raised here and the opera on a Sony Walkman in the back seat of his car Mr Keans aides have been careful not to talk about their candidates plans if he wins reelection They try to deflect questions about a place for him on the national Republican ticket in 1988 The Governor said I have no ambition to do that and I have no expectation that they will necessarily offer that Im running to serve four years Still the politician who wanted to be a history teacher knows the cardinal lesson of his profession Ive learned he said never to say never  TOMORROW The Democratic challenger Peter Shapiro
"HELMS BARS ENVOY, DEMANDING REAGAN HALT ABORTION AID",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/01/us/helms-bars-envoy-demanding-reagan-halt-abortion-aid.html,Senator Jesse Helms has threatened to hold up President Reagans nomination of an Ambassador to China until he receives a letter from the President promising that United States funds will not be granted to nations that coerce abortions and sterilization Mr Helms has bottled up the appointment of Winston Lord as Ambassador to China for nearly five weeks This diplomatic issue more so than others in the past has aroused more interest in New York than in Washington given Mr Lords background as a former head of the Council of Foreign Relations as the husband of the novelist Betty Bao Lord and as an associate of former Secretary of State Henry A Kissinger But it turned out today that Mr Helms a conservative Republican from North Carolina objects not to the nominee but to the policies of the equally conservative Reagan Administration Specifically Mr Helmss aides say the Senator is bristling over the Administrations policy of providing financial support to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities This year the Administration contributed 36 million to the agency whose aid recipients include such nations as China that reputedly practice coercive abortion and sterilization That support the Senator says is in defiance of a recently enacted law If the Administration promises to obey the law Mr Helms says he will stop fighting the ambassadorial appointment But the Administration has refused to give in arguing that it is breaking no law However the issue is eventually resolved it is another example of the considerable power Mr Helms wields on Capitol Hill and how he uses it Mr Reagan nominated Mr Lord last July and Mr Helms stalled a vote by the Foreign Relations Committee until Oct 1 The committee then approved the nomination by a vote of 16 to 1 with Mr Helms the dissenter Since then Mr Helms has kept the nomination from reaching the Senate floor by threatening a filibuster He has also blocked from consideration the nomination of James Spain as Ambassador to Sri Lanka until Mr Spain explains questions he raised in an article critical of the ambassadorial appointment process In the Lord case his aides say Mr Helmss real targets are President Reagan Secretary of State George P Shultz and M Peter McPherson administrator of the Agency for International Development Mr Lords nomination will go through the moment we get a letter from the President Shultz or McPherson to the effect that we will not support in any way coerced abortion and sterilization said James P Lucier Mr Helmss chief legislative assistant The Kemp Amendment This year Congress approved and Mr Reagan signed into law a proposal by Representative Jack F Kemp Republican from upstate New York that barred United States funds for any organization that supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization Mr Helms believes that in the case of aid to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities the Administration is defying this law according to his aides The Kemp amendment is unambiguous Mr Lucier said But the Administration has interpreted the law as permitting financing of the international organization since the agency itself does not participate in the management of the coercive programs At his confirmation hearings Mr Lord agreed with the Administrations interpretation of the law This month Mr Helms and four other Republican Senators William L Armstrong of Colorado Orrin G Hatch of Utah and Chic Hecht and Paul Laxalt of Nevada contended that Mr Lord had misconstrued the Presidents policies In a letter to Mr Reagan they wrote We do not think Mr Lords testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee demonstrates that he understands your attitude and policies with regard to abortion and foreign assistance When Time Is Limited The Senate is among the last bastions of individualism and a lone Senator can hold up a Presidential appointment by merely threatening a filibuster Senator Bob Dole the majority leader and the rest of the Senate leadership are usually loath to spend the days weeks or even months needed to obtain 60 votes to end debate particularly when the legislator threatening the filibuster plays the game as well as Mr Helms This is especially true late in a session when time is limited Now for example Senate leaders have a variety of spending bills that they want to bring to the floor including a conferees agreement on the bill to eliminate deficit spending Senators also use the confirmation process to obtain commitments from nominees and on occasion to engage in a battle of wills In the case of the nomination for Ambassador to Sri Lanka Mr Lucier said Mr Spain wrote articles in which he criticized the process of appointed Ambassadors in the Reagan Administration He charged that you could buy an ambassadorship and said that some political ambassaddors were incompetent According to Mr Lucier in committee hearings Mr Spain refused to name the ambassadors he was talking about But Mr Spain has now agreed to answer questions Mr Lucier added indicating that his nomination would then go through The Senates confirmation power is a prime strategy used by senators who seek to change Administration policy Last spring the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected a proposed promotion for William Bradford Reynolds chief of the Justice Departments civil rights division on the ground that he had failed to enforce civil rights laws dealing with affirmative action There is no indication however that the rejection of Mr Reynoldss nomination as Associate Attorney General will lead the Administration to change its policy and confirm to the committees interpretation of the civil rights laws Mr Helms has previously used the confirmation process to draw White House attention to his views In 1981 he persuaded the White House to withdraw the nomination of Norman Terrell as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agencys bureau of nuclear weapons control His opposition was based partly on the nominees role in nuclear arms control in previous Administrations On a broader level Mr Helms used the confirmation process to challenge what he considered the Administrations abandonment of a tough stance in arms talks with the Soviet Union He kept the nomination of Robert T Grey Jr as deputy director of the arms agency from going to the Senate floor after it was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee The White House withdrew the nomination

"KEMP, EYEING A PRESIDENTIAL BID, RAISES $1 MILLION AT THE WALDORF",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/01/nyregion/kemp-eyeing-a-presidential-bid-raises-1-million-at-the-waldorf.html,Representative Jack F Kemp came to New York last night to raise more than 1 million and lay the groundwork for a Presidential bid in 1988 Mr Kemp a Republican from the suburbs of Buffalo said the money would be good to have to fend off any possible reelection challenge next year But he said he could also use it to pay for travel and other costs in the early phases of the Presidential race Although President Reagan was reelected only last year the marathon process to succeed him is already under way Checking on Support If youre thinking about running because of the way the process is set up youd have to begin looking at a potential race prior to 1987 said Mr Kemp If you want to make a rational decision youve got to find out if theres any support If anybodys interested in your ideas If its all wrapped up Has the Vice President got it all locked up Last nights fundraising dinner at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel  was described by Mr Kemps staff as one of the biggest fundraising events ever held by a politician running for Federal office More than 1000 people dressed in black tie and evening gowns paid 1000 each producing more than twice as much money as Mr Kemp has ever spent on a campaign for reelection to the House where he is in his eighth term from the 31st District An additional 700000 was pledged to Mr Kemp by people who could not make it to the dinner Mr Kemps staff said Mr Kemp said the event was the first time he had ever held a fundraising event outside his congressional district But for more than a year now the Representative a professionalfootballplayerturnedpolitician has been crisscrossing the country paying special attention to states with early Presidential primaries or caucuses For years Mr Kemp has stressed his call for reinvigorating the economy through tax cuts and overhaul of the monetary system But now he is also speaking out more visibly as he put it in an interview before the dinner on social issues I have given two or three speeches in the last several months on a broad perspective on social issues Mr Kemp said In recent speeches he has described abortion as a humanrights issue and stressed that it is important that Christians be active in politics He is also sponsoring an amendment in the house to bar Federal funds for groups that provide abortions or refer women to abortion services Members of Mr Kemps staff said they hoped his strong stands on these issues would help differentiate him from another very active unannounced candidate Vice President Bush Traveling Heavily Mr Kemp said that the speeches represented longheld views but that he had not been offered forums in the past to gain wide audiences for them In the interview Mr Kemp said he planned in his speech at the dinner to speak of the fragile realignment taking place in American politics Weve helped create a sea change in American politics Mr Kemp said Today the neoconservative or the populist conservative or the progressive conservative  I distinguish from the old guard to the newguard wing of the Republican party  is on the offensive Its no longer austerity and pain and sacrifice Today it is growth and hope and opportunity Mr Kemps staff said the Congressman would not make any formal announcement for national office until after the midterm elections next year But he has already been traveling the country relentlessly Mr Kemp made 197 appearances for Republican candidates in 1984 and has already made 180 this year said his spokesman John Buckley The Luxury of Leaving District He has been particularly visible in states that conduct early selections of delegates to the Republican National Convention Mr Kemp has been in Michigan six times this year said Mr Buckley He has been in New Hampshire four times and will give the keynote address at the Republican state dinner in December He has been in Iowa five times and will address the State Farm Bureau there in December Mr Kemp said he had the luxury to make these forays because of the base he has built in his own district where he has routinely been reelected with 75 percent of the vote Last nights dinner was officially billed as a 50th birthday celebration for Mr Kemp who actually passed his 50th birthday last July 13 The cochairmen of the evening those who helped sell at least 20 tickets included the owners of eight professional football teams and Carrie Rozelle the wife of Pete Rozelle the National Football League commissioner As the guests sipped Sonoma County Chardonay with their Veal Florentine Frank Gifford the former New York Giants running back took the podium and introduced more than two dozen former receivers linemen and even a few defensive backs who once played football with Mr Kemp andd were scattered last night through the ballroom The chairman of the dinner was Herbert J Siegel president and chairman of the ChrisCraft Industries Among the other major contributors were Louis Bantle a tobaccoindusty lobbyist Morris J Amitay a writer and lobbyist on behalf of Israel Norman Braman the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles who also owns car dealerships in Miami Thomas Pownall chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation and Barney Skladany lobbyist for the Mobil Oil Corporation the National Rifle Association and the political action committee of the Grumman Corporation of Long Island Keeping It Loose Not everyone who bought tickets for last nights event was necessarily committed to Mr Kemp Drew Lewis the former United States Secretary of Transportation was listed as a vice chairman of last nights dinner although he did not attend I am a supporter of Jacks and of George Bushs and Howard Baker and Bob Dole Mr Lewis said in a telephone interview mentioning the former and present Senate majority leaders who are also considering running for president This is the time of year everybody is for everyone We should keep it loose and look at them all Former Secretary of State Henry A Kissinger gave a largely humorous speech in which he praised Mr Kemps positions on foreignpolicy issues

not made a decision on whether to run next year for the United States Senate seat held by Alfonse M DAmato and that she will not for at least four weeks I havent made the decision yet I havent had the time to do it said Mrs Ferraro who has been campaigning for other Democrats in Chicago Houston Buffalo and Nassau County She has also been promoting her new book Ferraro My Story I havent done the political part of it  Ive got to touch base with a lot of people she said Mayor Koch is one of those she said adding that she had not yet been able to schedule a luncheon with him I also have to sit down with my family she added Awaiting a Meeting The former VicePresidential candidate who was endorsed by Governor Cuomo two weeks ago even before her public decision said she was trying to schedule a meeting with Justice Department lawyers investigating her finances while she was a member of the House of Representatives Theyve finished with all the witnesses except for speaking with John and me she said referring to her husband John A Zaccaro That investigation could be a major factor in Mrs Ferraros decision several friends said Interviews with more than a dozen politicians many of them close to Mrs Ferraro produced split predictions on whether she would seek the Democratic nomination for Senate The consensus appeared to be that Mrs Ferraro wants to run but is concerned about the impact of a heated election campaign particularly on her husband His realestate dealings and service as a courtappointed administrator of an estate came under close scrutiny and criticism when she ran for vicepresident last year Mr Zaccaro pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor earlier this year as a result of one realestate transaction Manes Wont Guess Gerry loves the public eye and she was never happier than when she was in Congress said Borough President Donald R Manes of Queens who is also the boroughs Democratic chairman Yet he said echoing others I wouldnt guess whether she will or wont Several politicians speculated that Mrs Ferraro was postponing a public decision in order to hype her book But a close friend disagreed and also said the Queens Democrat had pulled her punches in the memoirs lest she offend too many other politicians In the book Mrs Ferraro was critical however of John Cardinal OConnor for his disapproval of her position on abortion that while she was personally opposed to it she did not have the right to impose her views on others She also criticized New York ItalianAmericans for their failure to support her an ItalianAmerican in last years campaign A Cuomo endorsement would deter some potential rivals except for District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn Politicians close to her expect her to run for the Senate regardless of Mrs Ferraros decision Six years ago Miss Holtzman won the Democratic primary but lost the general election to Mr DAmato Potential Candidates Other potential candidates have surfaced without waiting for Mrs Ferraro to make up her mind Mark Green who has written books critical of Congress and who lost to Bill Green for the House of Representatives in Manhattan five years ago said he would consider running if Mrs Ferraro does not His supporters argue that Miss Holtzman is too liberal and too unpopular among her fellow Democrats to mount a strong challenge of Senator DAmato Several legislators including Assemblyman Mark Alan Siegel of Manhattan are advancing former Gov Hugh L Carey as a possible candidate Mr Carey however said earlier this week that he was not interested in seeking another public office While Mr Green and Mr Carey were being promoted as possible candidates another Democrat Attorney General Robert Abrams took himself out of the Senate race He has definitely ruled out making a run for the Senate in 1986 said Ethan Geto Mr Abramss longtime political adviser Mr Geto said Mr Abrams was more interested in running for reelection next year and for Governor in the postCuomo era Mending Fences Mr Abrams had been one of several candidates mentioned by Mr Cuomo although most politicians interpreted that mention as an effort to rid himself of a Democrat with whom he has openly feuded Mr Cuomos relations with Mrs Ferraro his fellow ItalianAmerican Democrat from Queens have also been cool for many years according to aides of both Politicians close to the Governor and Mrs Ferraro speculated that Mr Cuomo made his unusual early endorsement of her so that he would not be blamed if she chose not to run and to mend fences with her in the event he seeks the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 She has a lot of friends nationally particularly among women said a Democrat who is considered close to Mrs Ferraro If she does run David Sawyer the advertising consultant is expected to be involved in her campaign along with Paul Maislin a poll taker who has completed a poll for Mrs Ferraro That survey according to politicians who have seen it shows a high negative for Mrs Ferraro but also finds that it could be overcome in a Senate campaign Miss Holtzman has retained Robert Squier and Carter Askew of Washington for her current campaign for district attorney and both would likely be involved in her Senate campaign
U.S. AIDES MOVING ON ENVOY TO CHINA,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/02/world/us-aides-moving-on-envoy-to-china.html,Administration officials said today that in an effort to free the nomination of Winston Lord as Ambassador to China they would comply with Senator Jesse A Helmss request for a statement barring the granting of United States funds to nations that coerce abortion and sterilization It was uncertain however if such a statement would bring Mr Lords nomination to the Senate floor for a vote The appointment of Mr Lord a former head of the Council on Foreign Relations who was also a senior aide to Henry A Kissinger when he was Secretary of State has been bottled up by Mr Helms since it gained the approval of the Foreign Relations Committee five weeks ago The dispute between the Administration and Senator Helms a North Carolina Republican involves United States funding for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which supports programs in China Mr Helms says China practices coercive abortion and sterilization Chinese officials have denied the accusations Public Repudiation Sought Mr Helms has insisted on public repudiation of support for coercive abortion as a condition for allowing a floor vote on Mr Lords nomination Theres no question that we are opposed to coerced abortion and sterilization and we will make that statement whenever he wishes said John Metelsky director of press relations for the Agency for International Development But AID officials refused to take an additional step sought by Mr Helms barring support of funds for the United Nations fund as long as it continued to aid China Mr Helms contends that American aid to the international agency is prohibited by legislation sponsored by Representative Jack Kemp Republican of Buffalo that forbids the use of United States funds for organizations that support or take part in managing programs of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization Focus on China The United Nations agency supports the training of family planning specialists in China AID officials said they would like to retain the flexibility to continue aid to the United Nations fund if it radically changed its role eliminating family planning training and merely providing contraceptives Mr Helms contends however that it is the abortion policy of China not the United Nations fund that should govern United States involvement Mr Metelsky noted that last summer before the Kemp amendment was enacted AID withheld 10 million of the 46 million earmarked for the United Nations fund to protest what it said was Chinas policy of coercive abortion The United Nations fund gives China 10 million in aid a year The 10 million was redirected to family planning programs in Africa Latin America the Caribbean and the Middle East and to United States organizations that provide family planning services in developing nations Mr Helms has also blocked from Senate consideration the nomination of James Spain as Ambassador to Sri Lanka until Mr Spain answers questions he raised in an article critical of the process for appointing ambassadors James P Lucier the senators chief legislative assistant said Mr Spain had agreed to answer the questions in writing

NASSAU RACE: THREE ISSUES DOMINATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/nyregion/nassau-race-three-issues-dominate.html,TO some voters the race for Nassau County Executive is more like a referendum on the Long Island Lighting Company the Shoreham nuclear power plant and the kickback trial involving payments to the Republican Party than a contest among four candidates Conflicting opinions on Lilco its management and policies have dominated the campaign in its final weeks spurred by the damage inflicted to the Islands power system by Hurricane Gloria The lingering effects of the storm and other issues were discussed by the four candidates during an hourlong debate last week at The New York Times The four particiapnts were Francis T Purcell the Republican incumbent who is seeking a third term as county executive John W Matthews the Democratic candidate who is making his second race against Mr Purcell Jack Olchin a deputy Nassau County attorney running on the Liberal Party line and Dr Raymond J Vuolo a physician and the Right to Life candidate In the debate Mr Purcell found himself in the uncomfortable position of being an apologist for the Long Island Lighting Company and its chief operating officers During sometimes heated exchanges Mr Purcell said that while he might disagree with some of the decisions made by Lilco management it was no time to change horses in the middle of the stream And he again urged that the Shoreham nuclear power plant be put on line He said this would help stabilize electric rates and reduce the Islands dependence on Middle East oil supplies Mr Olchin said the Liberal Party had not taken a position so far as Shoreham is concerned However he said he was personally very strongly in favor of opening Shoreham Mr Matthews an insulation contractor from Long Beach and a heavy contributor to the Democratic Party said Shoreham should never be opened as a nuclear facility but should be refitted to burn coal He said he hoped to bring about this and other changes at the utility by forcing the election of a new board of directors He said he had recently purchased 100 shares of Lilco preferred stock which he said gave him the right to call for the special election Under the utilitys bylaws any holder of preferred stock can request a special shareholders meeting to elect a majority of the board once the company fails to pay four quarterly dividends Lilco stopped paying preferred dividends on Oct 1 1984 and missed its fourth consecutive quarterly dividend last July 1 Lilco has responded by filing a suit to block Mr Matthewss challenge Meanwhile it has scheduled a board of directors election for Nov 29 The subject of Lilco dominated the debate just as it has the final weeks of the campaign The next most heatedly debated issue was the socalled 1 percent kickback scheme It came to the forefront in August in a monthlong trial in Federal District Court in Uniondale during which hundreds of witnesses were called to the stand to answer questions about the inner workings of the Nassau County Republican Committee A sixmember jury found that the Republican committee and the Town of Hempstead coerced past and present municipal employees into contributing 1 percent of their salaries to the party to obtain raises and promotions Mr Purcell who was Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead when the coercion took place acknowledged during the debate that there were some mistakes made in the Town of Hempstead theres no doubt about it But he insisted that the 1 percent case had been stretched out of proportion He recalled that in 1972 the Federal Bureau of Investigation came to his office contending there had been some alleged intimidation of some people to give political contributions We gave the FBI all of the help that they needed Mr Purcell said They investigated that for about seven or eight years a tremendously long investigation and then they dropped it Dr Vuolo dismissed the kickback matter saying it was not a viable issue And he said that the issue of Shoreham had been taken and blown out of all proportion Most of his comments were directed against abortion He insisted that the most important issue in this campaign is the fact that innocent human lives are being taken every single day through the country and particularly in Nassau County
KEY POSTS ON THE LINE IN ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/nyregion/key-posts-on-the-line-in-election.html,VIRTUALLY every elective town and county post in Nassau and Suffolk Counties will be on the line on Tuesday  the most important local elections in years Republicans now hold most of these offices Barring a major upset they will continue to do so and could even gain posts according to Democratic and Republican Party leaders The polls will be open from 6 AM to 9 PM A total of 13 million Long Islanders are registered to vote with about half expected to go to the polls Republicans outnumber Democrats by a ratio of three to two in both counties In Suffolk there are almost as many independents those who are not enrolled in any party as Democrats Despite the strong Republican complexion of both counties there are several significant contests In Nassau County Executive Francis T Purcell is the favorite to win a third term But John W Matthews the Democrat who is challenging Mr Purcell for a second time is trying to capitalize on public discontent with the Long Island Lighting Company and its handling of the Shoreham nuclear plant and the damage from Hurricane Gloria Mr Matthews is attempting in a stockholder action to force a change in the utilitys management Republican leaders acknowledge privately that in their view Mr Purcell who is in favor of Shorehams going into commercial opperation has not been aggressive enough in meeting the Lilco issues Theres something stirring and were throwing all the marbles into the Matthews campaign said Martin Mellman the Nassau Democratic chairman In a county where Republicans normally far outspend Democrats Mr Matthews with a campaign chest of nearly 100000 appears to be matching his Republican rival In Suffolk where the Democrats are virtually shut out of countywide office Judge James F X Doyle of Family Court hopes to capitalize on a RepublicanConservative split and win the politically important post of Surrogate Court judge The Republican incumbent Surrogate Ernest L Signorelli won renomination despite the opposition of Republican leaders and the Conservative Party Judge Kenneth K Rohl of Suffolk County Court who lost to Judge Signorelli in the Republican primary in September is the Conservative candidate The Right to Life Party is supporting Judge Doyle The Liberal Party virtually moribund in Suffolk County is fielding only a handful of candidates An underdog Democratic candidate for Suffolk District Attorney Robert C Gottlieb has attempted in the last week of the campaign to capitalize on criticism of District Attorney Patrick Henrys handling of a murderrape case in which the defendant James Diaz was acquitted Were doing over our radio spots going on cable television and putting out new literature Mr Gottlieb said The DA is asleep at the controls The 35yearold Democrat is making his second run for public office He previously lost a bid for the State Senate District Attorney Henry is seeking his third term In Nassau District Attorney Denis E Dillon seeking his third term has the endorsement of all five major parties But Jack Olchin the Nassau Liberal Party chairman has disavowed Mr Dillon because of his participation in demonstrations against abortion clinics Bill Baird who operates an abortion clinic is a writein candidate opposing Mr Dillon The Suffolk Democratic chairman Dominic J Baranello said he was optimistic that Democrats could win a majority of the 18 seats in the Suffolk County Legislature by making an issue of the Shoreham plant and Suffolk County Executive Peter F Cohalan who is midway through a fouryear term The election will be a referendum on Mr Cohalan Mr Baranello predicted He noted that Mr Cohalan was reelected two years ago on the basis of his opposition to the opening of the Shoreham plant and has changed his position to the extent that he supports a test of emergency evacuation procedures for the area arund the plant Such a test is a necessary prelude to opening the nuclear plant He has shown disdain and disregard for the electorate Mr Baranello said However Republican leaders believe that the Democrats will be hardpressed to prevent the Republican majority  now at 11 seats  from increasing in the County Legislature The Republicans believe that at least three Democratic seats are in jeopardy Democrats see up to four Republican seats as being marginal As for town offices Democrats now control three of the 10 town boards in Suffolk  Huntington Smithtown and East Hampton Both sides agree that Huntington could go Republican for the first time in many years In Nassau County Republicans control every town board seat in the three towns  Hempstead North Hempstead and Oyster Bay  and leaders of both parties agree that the shutout of Democrats is likely to continue There is no county legislature in Nassau but rather a sixmember County Board of Supervisors The supervisors of the cities of Long Beach and Glen Cove are the only Democrats now on the board Both cities are controlled by Democrats But Long Beach has now become questionable because of Democratic Supervisor Hannah Komanoffs close ties to the Republican Party Top Democrats including Mr Mellman the county party leader opposed her in a rerun of the Democratic primary last Monday which she lost to Bruce Nyman However Mrs Komanoff will be on the ballot Tuesday on the Republican and Liberal lines The Nassau elections are also marked by a rivalry between two top Republicans County Comptroller Peter King and Thomas S Gulotta Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead Town Both are considered potential candidates for statewide office next year Theyre both looking for as large a vote as they can get to show they can handle a statewide race said Joseph N Mondello the Nassau Republican chairman Senator Alfonse M DAmato who made the big jump from Hempstead Presiding Supervisor to the United States Senate five years ago warmed up for his reelection attempt next year by campaigning last weekend for Mrs Komanoff in Long Beach Beyond the county and town elections there are significant elections for five State Supreme Court seats in the 10th Judicial District which covers both counties For the second year Mr Mondello has refused to give bipartisan endorsement to a sitting Democratic judge and William M Blake the Suffolk Republican leader has gone along with that policy As a result the Democrats will be hardpressed to win in the bicounty elections Justice Alfred F Samenga of State Supreme Court a Democrat lost his judicial post last November when he sought reelection because he did not have Republican endorsement He was appointed to an interim term by Governor Cuomo this year and is again seeking election  on the Democratic Right to Life and Liberal lines  in both counties Another former Democratic judge Marilyn R Friedenberg lost her seat on the Family Court last year because of the Republican decision not to endorse sitting Democrats seeking reelection She is again seeking a Family Court post without Republican endorsement The abandonment of the bipartisan tradition could be particularly significant to Democrats next year when three Democratic State Supreme Court justices  David T Gibbons who is assigned to the Appellate Division Andrew DiPaola and John Thorp  will be up for reelection Mr Mondello said he had not changed his position that the voters not political leaders should decide whether a judge should be reelected Morally and ethically Ive always felt that was the correct decision he said even before I became county leader The policy has resulted in shrinking Democratic representation in the courts and eventually barring upsets there may be no one but Republican judges in the two counties
How to Get the Women's Movement Moving Again,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/books/how-to-get-the-womens-movement-moving-again.html,THIS IS ADDRESSED TO ANY WOMAN who has ever said we about the womens movement including those who say Im not a feminist but    And its addressed to quite a few men Its a personal message not at all objective and its in response to those who think our modern womens movement is over  either because it is defeated and a failure or because it has triumphed its work done its mission accomplished After all any daughter can now dream of being an astronaut after Sally Ride or running for President after Geraldine Ferraro I do not think that the job of the modern womens movement is done And I do not believe the movement has failed For one thing those of us who started the modern womens movement or came into it after marriage and children or from jobs as invisible women in the office still carry the glow of it changed my whole life an aliveness the satisfaction of finding our own voice and power and the skills we didnt have a chance to develop before I do believe though that the movement is in trouble I was too passionately involved in its conception its birth its growing pains its youthful flowering to acquiesce quietly to its going gently so soon into the night But like a lot of other mothers I have been denying the symptoms of what I now feel forced to confront as a profound paralysis of the womens movement in America And this in turn has forced me to think about how we can get the womens movement moving again  a new round of consciousnessraising for instance or utilizing the networks of professional women or ceasing the obsession with the matter of pornography I see as symptoms of the paralysis the impotence in the face of fundamentalist backlash the wasting of energy in internal power struggles when no real issues are at stake the nostalgic harking back to old rhetoric old ideas old modes of action instead of confronting new threats and new problems with new thinking the failure to mobilize the young generation who take for granted the rights we won and who do not defend those rights as they are being taken away in front of our eyes and the preoccupation with pornography and other sexual diversions that do not affect most womens lives I sense an unwillingness to deal with the complex realities of female survival in malemodeled careers with the new illusions of having it all in marriage and equality in divorce and with the basic causes of the grim feminization of poverty The potential of womens political power is slipping away between the poles of selfserving feminist illusion and male and female opportunism The promise of that empowerment of women that enabled so many of us to change our own lives is being betrayed by our failure to mobilize the next generation to move beyond us EVIDENCE OF THE MOVEMENTS paralysis has been impinging on my own life in many ways Over the last few years Ive noticed how the machinery for enforcing the laws against sex discrimination in employment and education has been gradually dismantled by the Reagan Administration and how the laws scope has been narrowed by the courts with little public outcry Professional lobbyists for womens organizations objected of course but there have been no mass protests from the women in the jobs and professions that those laws opened to them In the early days of the National Organization for Women nearly 20 years ago we demanded and won an executive order banning Government contracts to companies or institutions guilty of sex discrimination it was the first major weapon women could use to demand jobs Some officials in the Administration are proposing the orders elimination The Reagan Administration is also urging the courts to undo recent movement victories regarding equal pay for work of comparable value The crusade against womens right to choice in the matter of childbirth and abortion preached from the pulpits of fundamentalist churches and by the Catholic hierarchy first achieved a ban on Federal aid to poor women seeking abortion then the elimination of United States Government aid to thirdworld familyplanning programs that counsel abortion The Attorney General announced this summer he would seek to reverse the historic Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade which 12 years ago decreed that the right of a woman to decide according to her own conscience when and whether and how many times to bear a child was as basic a right as any the Constitution originally spelled out for men At a recent meeting to mobilize women in mass communications to help save that right I was amazed to hear a onetime radical feminist suggest that abortion should not be defended in terms of a womans right Womens rights are not chic in America anymore she argued The main interest of many feminist groups in various states in recent years seems to be outlawing pornography Laws prohibiting pornography as a form of sex discrimination and violation of civil rights have been proposed in Minnesota Indiana California and New York A former NOW leader who practices law in upstate New York was startled when she dropped in on a feminist fundraiser to be asked to support a nationwide ban on sexually explicit materials When she warned A law like that would be far more dangerous to women than the most obscene pornography she was greeted with incomprehension and hostility At a blacktie banquet at the Plaza Hotel in New York in September I proudly watched a sparkling parade of champion women athletes as they entertained the corporate donors who sponsor their games and scholarships through the 11yearold Womens Sports Foundation The women champions in basketball judo gymnastics tennis skiing swimming boxing running and sportscar and dogsled racing paraded down the runway in sequined miniskirts and satin jumpsuits clasping their hands over their heads in the victory gesture They gave credit to parents and teachers but not one mentioned the recent Supreme Court decision regarding Grove City College in Pennsylvania That decision threatens to remove school athletic programs from the protection of the law banning sex discrimination in Federally assisted education  which is what provided crucial athletic training to these new female champions in the first place At another reception of one of the many new networks of women corporate executives a woman in her late 30s holding a job a woman had never been given before in a large insurance company told me If my slot became open today they wouldnt give it to a woman Not because I havent done a good job  I keep getting raises But theyve stopped talking about getting more women on the board  or in the company The word has gone out from the White House They dont have to worry anymore about women and blacks Its over At a media womens reception for Christine Craft the last movement heroine to take a case to court against that particular mix of sex and age discrimination that threatens to impose a premature ceiling on the first generation of female broadcasters women now hitting their 40s many younger women competing for anchor jobs did not show up to support her At one company executives who faced classaction suits a decade ago now boast that their best new employees are the women They were shocked when one of their star superwomen on a rung very near the top became pregnant with her second child and announced she was quitting The boss even offered her an extended maternity leave which is not required by law or union contract but she quit anyway You may never have another chance like this her colleagues male and female protested Ill never have these years with my children again she answered Most of them did not understand They figured that whatever guilt or pressure she suffered trying to juggle baby and demanding job was her peculiar personal problem Another longtime feminist mother with three yuppie daughters banker lawyer talent agent  says regretfully Theyre not feminists    they take all that for granted She goes on to tell me that Janeys problem is her love life and her job and Anns is her kids and her job and Phyllis thinks maybe she should go back and get an MBA With all that and exercise class they dont have time for the meetings we used to go to Why do they have to be feminists when they never had to suffer like we did But the center for displaced housewives where this mother works  in a nottoosecure administrative job may close down soon because of a cutoff in Government funds for job training Seeking a parttime typist at 6000 a year the center was amazed to get more than 100 answers to a single ad including women with degrees and years of job experience Among the applicants was a longdivorced woman of retirement age who had served as a role model for feminist independence enjoying brief celebrity for the selfhelp book she had written about her first brave years alone Now she is applying for any kind of job typing sales  and has begun studying the ads for household help She is to put it bluntly desperate I have breakfast with two of my younger colleagues in the movement the best and brightest the kind that should be moving now into national leadership One tells me she is leaving for a new job in foreign affairs She has developed her womens rights office into such fine professional shape that any good pro can run it now She needs a new purpose room to grow The other barely 30 has the professional skills honed during 10 years of service to the womens movement but is not interested in the movement job Whats the use of all this professionalism if the grassroots movement isnt there she shrugs Whats wrong with it I ask Theres a yearning for the same old music the same old marches by the ones who still meet in the church basements she says But they are the desperate ones the lonely ones and the pros like myself who still make some kind of living off the movement Lets face it the yuppies  I hate that word  who are in the halfway decent jobs that the movement opened to women dont relate to the old rhetoric The new professional networks which supposedly help them get ahead dont even pretend to be feminist anymore Thinking of my own daughterthedoctor and my daughterinlaw the editormother I realize how much more complex confident vital and pressured their lives are than ours were Their problems putting it all together keep them too busy to go to meetings But are their problems as serious as those of the desperate housewives and the invisible women in the offices 20 years ago Or as serious as those of the women struggling alone for economic and emotional survival today Do women who are moving ahead in their own lives have less in common with the desperate ones Do they even want to deny the very possibility of that desperation We were all pretty desperate then This last year books articles and notices of television programs have been piling up on my desk about these new problems of the postfeminist generation Smart Women Foolish Choices for instance and Lesser Lives This growing chorus expresses a personal disillusionment with maledefined careers a faintheartedness about having it all a rebellion against superwoman standards a sense of malaise or guilt or regret about prices paid in marriage or with children  and a recurring theme of not wanting to be like a man For most of this year NOW has been locked in a bitter vengeful internal power struggle Eleanor Smeal for whom the limit of a fouryear presidency of NOW had been waived for the duration of the equal rights amendment battle came out of retirement to run against her successor Judy Goldsmith in midterm She blamed her for NOWs depleted treasury and loss of members and demanded a return to street demonstrations for ERA and free choice in abortion Many older feminists who thought both had been good leaders for their time deplored the waste of energy in such a clash as powerful enemies were closing in Futile nostalgia for the radical marching tunes of another day will not enlist a new generation in different circumstances to save the rights now being taken away But the weakening of the organization and the longing for the old sense of empowerment are real enough  and not likely to be solved by recriminations that unfortunately continue to divide NOW since Eleanor Smeals return to power A WARE OF THESE symptoms and yet denying my own sense that the American womens movement was over not ready to admit defeat but wanting to move on to other things myself I went to Kenya last summer out of a sheer sense of historic duty to see the thing through to its end Most cardcarrying American feminists were not even bothering with the meeting in Nairobi NOW had scheduled its own convention in New Orleans at the same time as the United Nations World Conference of Women Ten years earlier when the modern womens movement was spreading from America to the world I had joined women wanting to organize in their countries in appealing to the UN to call a world assembly of women At the first two world womens meetings in Mexico in 1975 and Copenhagen in 1980 I had seen the beginnings of international networking among women broken up by organized disrupters led by armed gunmen shouting slogans against imperialism and Zionism I had been appalled at the way the official male delegates from Arab countries and other thirdworld and Communist nations that control the UN showed contempt for womens rights using those conferences mainly to launch a new doctrine of religious and ethnic hate equating Zionism and racism And I had been repelled by the way the delegates from Western countries mostly male officials or their wives and female flunkies let them thereby rob those conferences of the moral and political weight they might have given to the advance of women worldwide This year the United States delegation had instructions from President Reagan to walk out if the question of Zionism was included in the conclusions reached at Nairobi To my amazement the womens movement emerged in Nairobi with sufficient strength worldwide to impose its own agenda of womens concerns over the male political agenda that had divided it before Despite or because of the backlash and other problems they face at home nearly 17000 women from 159 nations assembled some 14000 having paid their own way or been sent by volunteer church or womens groups to the unofficial forum that is part of every such UN conference Some traveled by plane three and four days or by bus from African villages There was a bypassing or bridging of the old abstract ideological conflicts that had seemed to divide women before  a moving beyond the old rhetoric of career versus family equality versus development feminism versus socialism religion versus feminism or feminism as an imperialist capitalist arrogance irrelevant to poor thirdworld women What took the place of all this was a discussion of concrete strategies for women to acquire more control of their lives Thirdworld revolutionaries Arab and Israeli women as well as Japanese Greeks and Latins gathered under a baobab tree where every day at noon like some African tribal elder I led a discussion on Future Directions of Feminism We shared common concerns about how to move ahead and earn a living in mans world  as women even in African villages now have to do  without losing even using ones best values and strengths as women We talked about how to keep forging ahead as women when other questions  like the IsraeliArab conflict or the superpowers nucleararms race  are preoccupying our nations and using up their resources We shared ideas on how to keep advancing even underground when fundamentalist groups try to take away a womans right to control her own body or to move independently in the world as they are doing in Egypt and the United States and have done in Iran When the blackveiled Iranian women in their chadors and with their armed male guards occupied my tree one day we moved to another and when they occupied both trees we carried on our dialogue in the sun Thats the way women have to move now everywhere in the world I said We go forward we get pushed back we regroup Its not a winlose battle to be finished in any year And we dont waste energy on nonessentials said an African teacher At the official UN conference in Nairobi American women delegates mainly Republicans led by Maureen Reagan the Presidents daughter were working the hall for consensus on forwardlooking strategies on equality that included things American feminists hardly dare dream of in Reagans Washington  parental leave child care family planning and an economic value for womens work in home and field counted in a nations GNP as well as equal pay for work of comparable value Many of the other delegations from European Latin American African and Asian nations were now led by or included women who had been fighting for womens rights at home Ninety percent of the worlds governments have set up national bodies for the advancement of women most of them in this last decade while ours in the United States have been dismantled At Nairobi when Arab and Communist delegations engaged as usual in antiZionist and antiimperialist rhetoric these strong women delegates especially the Africans kept warning that the women of the world would condemn those who blocked consensus on equality And they forced the male diplomats to negotiate round the clock until they deleted that antiZionist expression of hate that has been ritual at every UN conference since 1975 To the amazement of experts a program involving forwardlooking strategies to advance women to equality was adopted by consensus of the nations of the world calling on the UN to implement them and to report back to another world assembly of women before the year 2000 I and other Americans  as many black as white among the 2000 of us at Nairobi went home strengthened resolved not to accept backwardnation status for American women For though we had gone to Nairobi subdued by our own setbacks and sophisticated enough not to offer Western feminism as the answer to the problems of women of the third world it was truly humiliating to discover that we are no longer the cutting edge of modern feminism or world progress toward equality Even Kenya has an equal rights clause in its Constitution HOW CAN WE LET THE WOMENS movement die out here in America when what we began is taking hold now all over the world I would like to suggest 10 things that might be done to break the blocks that seem to have stymied the womens movement in America 1 BEGIN A NEW ROUND OF CONsciousnessraising for the new generation These women each thinking she is alone with her personal guilt and pressures trying to have it all having second thoughts about her professional career desperately trying to have a baby before it is too late with or without husband and maybe secretly blaming the movement for getting her into this mess are almost as isolated and as powerless in their isolation as those suburban housewives afflicted by the problem that had no name whom I interviewed for The Feminine Mystique over 20 years ago Those women put a name to their problem they got together with other women in the new feminist groups and began to work for political solutions and began to change their lives That has to happen again to free a new generation of women from its new double burden of guilt and isolation The guilts of lessthanperfect motherhood and lessthanperfect professional career performance are real because its not possible to have it all when jobs are still structured for men whose wives take care of the details of life and homes are still structured for women whose only responsibility is running their families I warned five years ago that if the womens movement didnt move into a second stage and take on the problems of restructuring work and home a new generation would be vulnerable to backlash But the movement has not moved into that needed second stage so the women struggling with these new problems view them as purely personal not political and no longer look to the movement for solutions Putting new names to their problems they might stop feeling guilty for not being able to conduct their professional lives just like men might give each other support in new patterns of professional advance and parenting might together demand new political solutions of parental leave and child care from company or profession or community or even once again from government They might then find new energy to save the rights they now take for granted or even secretly resent because they are so hard to live with 2 MOBILIZE THE NEW PROFESSIONAL networks and the old established volunteer organizations to save womens rights We cant fight fundamentalist backlash with backwardlooking feminist fundamentalism Secondstage feminism is itself pluralistic and has to use new pluralist strengths and strategies The women who have been 30 and 40 percent of the graduating class from law school or business school and 47 percent of the journalism school classes the ones whove taken womens studies the women who grew up playing Little League baseball and cheered on those new champion women athletes the new professional networksof women in every field every woman who has been looking to those networks only to get ahead in her own field must now use her professional skills to save the laws and executive orders against sex discrimination in education and employment They must restore the enforcement machinery and the classaction suits that opened up all these opportunities to her in the first place The volunteer organizations it became clear in Nairobi have been given new goals and gumption and professional expertise by the womens movement Let NOW heal its internal wounds and join with these other groups as it did in the ERA struggle to face the current emergency rather than indulge in wishful thinking about refighting the ERA battle 3 GET OFF THE PORNOGraphy kick and face the real obscenity of poverty No matter how repulsive we may find pornography laws banning books or movies for sexually explicit content could be far more dangerous to women The pornography issue is dividing the womens movement and giving the impression on college campuses that to be a feminist is to be against sex More important it is diverting energies that need to be spent saving the basic rights now being destroyed Karen DeCrow who once was elected president of NOW on the slogan Out of the mainstream into the revolution wrote a recent article entitled Strange Bedfellows for Penthouse She pointed out that the new feministsupported proposals to make pornography an illegal violation of the civil rights of women have an unlookedfor effect They aid the far right agenda that would also ban the teaching of evolution in schools prohibit a womans right to choose abortion cut Government funding for textbooks that portray women in nontraditional roles and repeal Federal statutes against spouse and child abuse What is behind some womens obsession with pornography Womens sexuality has been distorted and suppressed in almost every society we learned at Nairobi and that suppression has gone hand in hand with a general attempt to deny women freedom to control their own lives to move and earn independently in society Pornography and also the crusade to suppress pornography reduce women to a single dimension defining them as only passive sex objects not people who can run their own lives But I think the secret this obsession with pornography may mask for women alone for aging women and for women still more economically dependent on men than they would like is fear of poverty which is the ultimate obscenity for Americans I sat at a dinner table recently with several women who I know are struggling personally with these problems and could not believe their venom against the young rock star Madonna I suggested that teenagers identified with her gutsiness strength and independence as well as with her notatallpassive sexuality which to me was not a retreat from womens liberation but a celebration of it Whoever said that feminism shouldnt be sexy They were women in their 40s 50s and 60s and they virtually spat in disgust Perhaps an unspoken reason so many women are protesting sexually explicit materials is that their own sexuality is denied by society But I suspect that as long as sex is distorted by womens economic dependence or fear of it it cant be truly freely enjoyed The obscenity that not even many feminists want to confront in personal terms is the sheer degradation of being poor in opulent upwardly mobile America Of course the womens movement in America like all such revolutions everywhere has been mainly a middleclass movement but the shameful secret it has never really dealt with is the fact that more and more middleclass women are sinking into poverty Americas first movement for womens rights died out after winning the vote four generations ago because women didnt tackle the hard political tasks of restructuring home and work so that women who married and had children could also earn and have their own voice in the decisionmaking mainstream of society Instead those women retreated behind a cultural curtain of female purity focusing their energies on issues like prohibition much like the pornographic obsession of some feminists today 4 CONFRONT THE ILLUsion of equality in divorce Economists and feminists have been talking a lot lately about the feminization of poverty in theoretical terms but the American womens movement has not developed concrete strategies that get at its root cause Its not just a question of women earning less than men though as long as women do not get equal pay for work of comparable value or earn Social Security or pensions for taking care of children and home they are both economically dependent on marriage and motherhood and pay a big economic price for it And this is as true for divorced aging yuppies as for welfare mothers A startling new book by the sociologist Lenore J Weitzman The Divorce Revolution The Unexpected Social and Economic Consequences for Women and Children in America reveals that in the 1970s when 48 states adopted nofault divorce laws treating men and women equally in divorce settlements laws feminists originally supported  divorced women and their children suffered an immediate 73 percent drop in their standard of living while their exhusbands enjoyed a 42 percent rise in theirs In dividing marital property Lenore Weitzman reports judges have systematically overlooked the major assets of many marriages the husbands career assets that the wife helped make possible his professional education that she may have helped support the career on which he was able to concentrate because she ran the home and his salary pension health insurance and earning power that resulted They have also ignored the wifes years of unpaid housework and child care not totally insured by Social Security in the event of divorce and her drastically diminished job prospects after divorce And for most the equal division of property means the forced sale of the family home  which used to be awarded to the wife and children Child support which has often been inadequate unpaid and uncollectable usually ends when the child is 18 just as college expenses begin Thus the vicious cycle whereby an everincreasing majority of the truly poor in America are families headed by women A new generation of feminist lawyers and judges has now drafted and must get urgent grassroots political support for the kind of law needed a law that treats marriage as a true economic partnership  and includes fairer standards of property division maintenance and child support It should be a law that does not penalize women who have chosen family over or even together with professional career 5 RETURN THE ISSUE OF abortion to the matter of womens own responsible choice I think feminists have been so traumatized by the fundamentalist crusade against abortion and all the talk of fetuses and when life begins that they are in danger of forgetting the values that made abortion a feminist issue in the first place Underneath the hysteria poll after poll shows that the great majority of women in this nation and most men still want to decide when and whether to have a child in accordance with their own conscience This includes women of faith including the majority of Catholic women Attacks on the Pope and picketing the churches as some desperate or deranged male and female abortion champions have lately proposed would play right into the hands of our right to life enemies who love to paint feminists as satanic opponents of God and family We must not surrender family values and religious principles to the far right Let the new women theologians and feminist women of faith in every church take on the fundamentalist preachers I think women who are young and those not so young today must be able to choose when to have a child given the necessities of their jobs They will indeed join their mothers who remember the humiliations and dangers of backstreet butcher abortions in a march of millions to save the right of legal abortion I certainly support a march for womens choice of birth control and legal aborion NOW has called for one in the spring of 1986 6 AFFIRM THE DIFFERences between men and women New feminist thinking is required if American women are to continue advancing in mans world as they must to earn their way and yet not become like men This fear is heard with more and more frequency today from young women including many who have succeeded and some who have failed or opted out of maledefined careers More books like Carol Gilligans In a Different Voice and consciousnessraising sessions are needed Firststage feminism denied real differences between women and men except for the sexual organs themselves Some feminists still do not understand that true equality is not possible unless those differences between men and women are affirmed and until values based on female sensitivities to life begin to be voiced in every discipline and profession from architecture to economics where until recently all concepts and standards were defined by men This is not a matter of abstract theory alone but involves the restructuring of hours of work and patterns of professional training so that they take into account the fact that women are the people who give birth to children It must lead to concrete changes in medical practice church worship the writing of history standards of ethics even the design of homes and appliances 7 BREAKTHROUGH FOR older women The womens movement has never put serious energy into the job that must be done to get women adequately covered by Social Security and pensions especially those women now reaching 65 who spent many years as housewives and are ending up alone The need for more independent and shared housing for older women now living alone in suburban houses they cant afford to sell or lonely furnished rooms  and the need for services and jobs or volunteer options that will enable them to keep on living independent productive lives  has never been a part of the womens movement agenda But that first generation of feminist mothers women now in their 60s is a powerful political resource for the movement as these women retire from late or early professional or volunteer careers Women in their 50s and 60s are shown by the polls to be more firmly committed than their daughters to the feminist goals of equality Let the womens movement lead the rest of society in breaking the spell of the youth cult and drawing on the still enormous energies and the wisdom that may come to some of us in age 8 BRING IN THE MEN ITS passe surely for feminists now to see men only as the enemy or to contemplate separatist models for emotional or economic survival Feminist theorists like Barbara Ehrenreich cite dismal evidence of the new men opting out of family responsibilities altogether But in my own life I seem to see more and more young men and older ones  even former male chauvinist pigs  admitting their vulnerability and learning to express their tenderness sharing the care of the kids even though most of them may never share it equally with their wives And as men let down their masks of machismo and admit their dependence on the women in their lives women may admit a new need to depend on men without fear of sinking back into the old abject subservience After all even women who insist they are not and never will be feminists have learned to defend themselves against real male brutality Look at Charlotte Donahue Fedders the wife of that Security and Exchange commissioner who testified in divorce court about his repeated abuse  his repeated beatings caused black eyes and a broken eardrum At one time a woman in her situation would have kept that shame a secret The Reagan Administration had to ask him to resign because wifebeating is no longer politically acceptable even in conservative America in 1985 I dont think women can or should try to take the responsibility for liberating men from the remnants of machismo But there has to be a new way of asking what do men really want to echo Freud a new kind of dialogue that breaks through or gets behind both our masks Women cannot restructure jobs or homes just by talking to themselves 9 CONTINUE TO FIGHT for real political power Although feminists do not now and never really did support a woman just because she is a woman there is no substitute for having women in political offices that matter But more women are discovering that they have to fight as men do in primaries where victory is not certain and not just wait for an open seat After the ERAs defeat feminists and their supporters raised money nationally to run women candidates in virtually every district in Illinois Florida and North Carolina where legislators voted against the amendment And in that single election they increased sizably womens representation in those state legislatures 10 MOVE BEYOND SINgleissue thinking Even today I do not think womens rights are the most urgent business for American women The important thing is somehow getting together with men who also put the values of life first to break through the paralysis that fundamentalist backlash has imposed on all our movements It is not only feminism that is becoming a dirty word in America but also liberalism humanism pluralism environmentalism and civil liberties The very freedom of political dissent that enabled the womens movement to start here has been made to seem unsafe for todays young men as well as young women I think the yuppies are afraid to be political Women may have to think beyond womens issues to join their energies with men to redeem our democratic tradition and turn our nations power to the interests of life instead of the nuclear arms race that is paralyzing it Ive never for instance seen the need for a separate womens peace movement Im not really sure that women by nature are more peaceloving than men They were simply not brought up to express aggression the way men do they took it out covertly on themselves and on their men and children psychologists would say But the human race may not survive much longer unless women move beyond the nurture of their own babies and careers to politcial decisions of war and peace and unless men who share the nurture of their children take responsibility for ending the arms race before it destroys all life In that sense I think the womens movement is only a particular moment in human evolution and once its job is really done then it can and should be allowed to fade away honorably discharged
THE WORLD;   JESSE HELMS IS A BIT ANNOYED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/weekinreview/the-world-jesse-helms-is-a-bit-annoyed.html,Peking is a bit annoyed with the Reagan Administration lately The Administration in turn is more than a bit annoyed with Senator Jesse Helms who isnt all that happy about the Administration or for that matter about China The conservative Republican from North Carolina is responsible for delaying Senate confirmation of Winston Lord as Ambassador to China by threatening a filibuster if it comes to the floor Mr Helms has nothing against Mr Lord personally His target is the manner in which the Administration is interpreting a law barring United States funds for any organization that supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization The Administration including Mr Lord does not think this should bar a 36 million contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which helps the worlds most populous country keep a lid on births but according to officials does not participate in the management of coercive programs Mr Helms does not agree and will allow Mr Lords nomination to go through only if he gets a letter from the President or some other high official assuring him that the United States will not support coerced abortion and sterilization Late in the week Administration officials said they would give the Senator his letter but whether it would be enough to end the standoff was another matter Even if that stalemate ends the Administration will not have finished with Mr Helms He is also holding up the nomination of James Spain as Ambassador to Sri Lanka In Mr Spains case Mr Helms was objecting to an article he wrote saying that ambassadorships could be purchased and had sometimes been given to people who were incompetent James P Lucier a Helms aide said Mr Spain had refused to name the ambassadors he was criticizing but that he now says he will name names His nomination will then go through Mr Lucier said
EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE IN NASSAU EXECUTIVE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/nyregion/excerpts-from-debate-in-nassau-executive-race.html,Following are excerpts from a debate at The New York Times last week among the candidates for Nassau County Executive Francis T Purcell the incumbent RepublicanConservative John W Matthews Democrat Jack Olchin Liberal and Dr Raymond J Vuolo Right to Life LILCOS MANAGEMENT Q Mr Purcell do you approve of the way Lilco is now being managed or do you favor a public takeover as is being advocated in Suffolk PURCELL Well I dont approve of the present management I think theres a lot of things that have to be corrected there I think it should be made very clear that I feel that Shoreham should open But I do think theres been a lot of mistakes made by the management and it could be corrected Now as far as taking it over theres a big problem and a very serious one and I would have no objection if someone got in there and could run Lilco Im interested mostly that the power be there for Nassau and Suffolk County One of the big problems on a takeover is that Lilco pays about 200 million a year in taxes mostly to Suffolk County Suffolk County gets about 125 million and Nassau gets about 75 million If there was a public takeover it would probably mean that this would be off the tax roll And I think even the Governor said that he would like to look into it very closely before there is a public takeover Who runs Lilco I could care less about Q Would you like to keep Mr Catacosinos as chairman or would you like to see him replaced PURCELL I think that this would be up to the stockholders I think that you [cant] change horses right at this particular minute without somebody else to come in and pick up the problems And Catacosinos has made mistakes but I think he has brought it into pretty good perspective financially But I think the management has a lot to learn and a lot to do there and they need some leadership VUOLO I think there is such a sparsity of substantive issues in this election that Lilco has been taken and blown out of all proportion It isnt the function of the County Executive to want to replace or not replace the leadership of Lilco I do think the County Executive has a responsibility to see to it that his constituents get safe cheap electric power The most important issue in this campaign is the fact that all of my opponents are for abortion on demand And the fact that innocent human lives are being taken every single day throughout the country and particularly in Nassau County OLCHIN As far as Shoreham is concerned the Nassau Liberal Party has not taken a position I personally am very strongly in favor of opening Shoreham I think its an absolute necessity so that Long Island will have the power that it needs On the question of Lilco the Nassau County Liberal Party calls for a nonpartisan commission One person named by Governor Cuomo one named by the County Executive of Nassau County one named by the County Executive of Suffolk County And those three to name two impartial nonpolitical people to find out was Lilco prepared for Hurricane Gloria and did they do an adequate job of restoring power MATTHEWS The Lilco issue is a question of leadership Mr Purcell has marched lockstep with Lilco officials in the past four years The 21 percent rate increase that Lilco received two years ago Mr Purcell was in favor of To this moment Lilcos new rate increase is on the board Mr Purcell has yet to direct the county attorneys office to mention anything about that rate increase Mr Purcell stopped Lilco from paying its taxes to Suffolk County Mr Purcell made a secret deal with Lilco to put the Coliseum in the Shoreham evacuation plan so Lilco and Mr Purcell and Mr Catacosinos are all wrapped up into one What I have done as an individual is call for a meeting of the stockholders both preferred and common to replace this board Can you imagine a company who has someone like me calling for their disposition to then go ahead and sue me and all their other enemies in one lawsuit Theyre a terribly managed company The stockholders both the preferred and common will have an opportunity to change that management And at that time well decide whether Shoreham goes on line whether it becomes a plant that could operate with coal  coal is cheaper than nuclear OPENING SHOREHAM Q Do you think Shoreham should come on line PURCELL Yes I think it should I think its almost incredulous that the Governor of the State of New York can go up to Rockland County at Indian Point and help them put that plant on line when there are 244000 people in that close proximity to the plant He has taken a paranoid position on the Shoreham plant on the possibilities of opening that and his resistance to it is complete Mr Matthews mentions coal Maybe well open Shoreham maybe well use coal I wonder if Mr Matthews checked with the environmental protection people and the people in the Shoreham area if they would like a coalburning plant instead of a nuclear plant There are 75 nuclear plants operating in this country and they are stabilizing rates in different areas Now John Matthews also said that Purcell was in favor of the rate increase Id like to read from a statement that I made on July 22 1983 in Mineola The rate increase that Lilco was asking for would be an economic disaster for Long Island businesses and Long Island homeowners For small firms it could be the final blow that puts them out of business For others it could be the final straw that drives them to move someplace else John Matthews has been to two board meetings in four years and he does not know what has been going on And he does not have any idea of our county attorneys office representation at every Lilco hearing And we have been opposed to rate increases I dont think Lilco should go bankrupt though I think it would be wrong because if we have a bankrupt Lilco were not going to have anybody that wants to do business with them So I think Shoreham should go on The management is something else If Mr Matthews can change the management more power to him MATTHEWS With regard to public power the people that I will present this week to become members of the new board of directors will all be for public power And I would just like to suggest that there are 2200 public power authorities in the United States The city of Los Angeles is run by a public power authority and the state of Nebraska is run by a public power authority We have public power in New York State with the New York State Power Authority We have enough hydropower in Canada from St James Bay to close every nuclear plant east of the Mississippi One of the main problems with Shoreham and the evacuation of Shoreham is that people can only go eastwest on Long Island When youre coming from Rockland County you can go to all four points of the compass but on Long Island you can only get out eastwest And I bet even today when people read about this debate theyre not going to understand that if there was a radiological accident at Shoreham 140000 people would be taken from Suffolk County and moved to the Nassau Coliseum where they would there be decontaminated and put in 52 local schools And that is what the people of Nassau County dont want That is what Mr Purcell illegally did last year by granting Lilco the authority to move people from Suffolk County to the Coliseum And that is what I am challenging in court right now Mr Purcells actions and Lilcos actions have been lockstep and thats why its become such a vocal issue in this campaign VUOLO Mr Matthews acts as though he can control who the board of directors will be in Lilco How much preferred stock do you own in Lilco Mr Matthews MATTHEWS I own 100 shares I purchased it for the express purpose of calling the meeting so that we would have a new board of directors VUOLO Do you think with your 100 shares you can dictate who the board of directors will be Thats contrary to my knowledge of corporate action MATTHEWS Im not personally running for this board of directors but  VUOLO It sounds as though you are MATTHEWS I am using this as the catalyst so that other people can manage this company in a better way OLCHIN Mr Matthews is unilaterally saying that Lilco was at fault in Hurricane Gloria I dont see how he  hes no expert  can tell us that this board must be replaced I call for this nonpartisan commission to determine the culpability of that present board Then I could say whether Mr Matthews is right or wrong RATE INCREASES Q Do you all agree that Lilco is a deeply troubled company and regardless of what happens to Shoreham that major rate increases are going to be necessary And would those major rate increases jeopardize the economy of Long Island And what would you do about it PURCELL I think its an interesting question in view of the fact that the rates at Lilco are at the present time lower than Con Edison in New York City and lower than Rockland County The longer the Governor keeps holding the people hostage with Shoreham and his resistance to Shoreham theyre paying interest on that plant every day and it isnt producing Wherever nuclear power has been put into operation in 75 different places it has helped stabilize the rates So at the present time they do not intend to ask for another rate increase until 1987 John Matthews is reaching for the straw to change the world by buying 100 shares of stock in Lilco and incidentally the law case is not even going to go to court Two days after election John Matthews will disappear into the wisp of the wind like he did four years ago at the same time MATTHEWS Thats beneath you Mr Purcell to talk like that If Shoreham goes on line the rates will double If Shoreham does not go on line the rates will go up but they will not go up as high And Im talking about going on line as a nuclear plant If a new board is elected at Lilco we would have the assurances that that board would be able to work with the Governor of this state and that the Governor of this state would then perhaps be for industrial development bonds for the new Lilco Because were not going to close down Lilco Were going to have a new Lilco which is getting rid of a board that cannot function with the Governor of this state The problem that Lilco has right now is the financial markets have been closed to them Theyre going to remain closed until theres a new management For the retired woman whos paying 75 a month for her electric bill in a threeroom apartment in Elmont knowing that its going to go to 150 a month thats a stronger issue than anything else that we can talk about THE KICKBACK CASE Q The 1 percent kickback case Mr Purcell you were part of the Republican Party organization during the period mentioned in this suit and in the period covered in the suit that was later dropped out Do you feel that contributing on the basis of 1 percent was a fair way for a party to enrich itself or to finance its operations PURCELL I think the 1 percent case has been stretched out of proportion There were some mistakes made in the Town of Hempstead and theres no question about it In fact in 1972 the FBI came to my office with some facts that there had been some alleged intimidation of some people to give a contribution We gave the FBI all of the help that they needed They investigated that for about seven or eight years a tremendously long investigation And then they dropped the investigation And then of course the American Civil Liberties Union under Mr [Bert] Neuborne [attorney for the plaintiffs]  they used some college students to pursue this There were a couple of people who alleged that they were forced to give money There was no question there were some mistakes made A few people paid the penalty unfortunately and the County of Nassau was not found guilty in the case And incidentally I was never called We cooperated 100 percent in the case and the FBI they did drop the case eventually Q Did you feel that you personally had to give at least 1 percent PURCELL I am not a wealthy man by any stretch of the imagination I always gave more than 1 percent because the party always supported me as a candidate Even this year I dont have to delve into my personal money or anything like that And the party does support candidates which I think basically and fundamentally is the right way rather than having people subservient to anyone with big donations OLCHIN I have a flyer that is being distributed throughout Nassau County and the face of it says Have you applied for your refund And just let me read for the record Get your taxpayers refund on the 1 percent kickbacks from GOP headquarters Taxpayer refund application Nassau GOP headquarters Westbury New York Please refund to me 1 percent of my tax bills for the past 10 years representing part of the increase in taxes that I have been forced to pay due to illegal 1 percent kickback of public employees coerced by the Nassau GOP Total taxes paid during 1973 to 83 1 percent of the above line payable to the undersigned Your name and address Now I object to deceptive political literature And this is a totally deceptive piece The average person is very gullible And what that case decided in Federal Court was that a certain limited class of Hempstead Town employees in the year 1973 to 76 might be entitled to a refund VUOLO I truly believe that demanding 1 percent from county employees is a blatant extortion and has to be wrong But I dont really think things would change very much if Mr Olchin or Mr Matthews were elected Obviously they wouldnt make the same mistake of demanding a certain percentage publicly But patronage being what it is would go on and on An independent candidate is the one who should be elected to get rid of all of this patronage situation TAXES AND THE BUDGET Q A few years back the county did run a deficit between 40 and 60 million But you were able to go to Albany and the State Legislature came up with a penny increase in the sales tax And then we had a good turnaround as far as sales were concerned Whats going to happen if the economy doesnt continue to do as well as it might Does this mean an increase in taxes PURCELL Its very hard to predict what might be coming down the road And I think that we all figure that maybe there will be some softening You just wonder how far an economy can go and I think ours in Nassau County has been extremely good But I think that in looking back over the surpluses and the deficits in the county  I came in office in 1977 so my first budget was 1978 the one that I had to work on We were 16 million in the hole that year The state was in trouble that year New York City was in trouble For the next three years 79 80 and 81 we had pluses all along the line In 1982 we made a mistake in the county and I was one that wrote to the Board of Supervisors that I thought we made a serious mistake We had a 3 percent fuel oil tax we dont have that anymore That fuel oil tax brought in about 13 to 14 million for each penny I recommended to the Board of Supervisors that we reduce it from three cents to one cent and which meant that we would lose about 26 million in income but I felt that we could handle it The Board of Supervisors against my opposition reduced it to zero We do not have a fuel oil tax in the county of Nassau now Suffolk County has a penny and a half and New York City has four cents It was a mistake to take it off because it meant a loss of about 39 million Our deficit in 1981 was almost that amount  40 million We did get the sales tax in for a penny And I think we have to recognize whats happened with that penny It doesnt all go to the county Onequarter of a cent of that goes to the towns which amounts to about 21 million a year The other quarter of a cent this year is going to be taken off completely We are reducing from three and threequarters cents to three and a half cents the sales tax in 1986 And my budget which will be out very shortly for 1986 will be 35 percent instead of 375 The question you ask is whats going to happen Nobody has a crystal ball But we did wind up this year with a surplus of about roughly 25 million MATTHEWS The county had a tax rate hike of 11 percent in 82 9 percent in 83 4 percent in 84 Mr Purcells shortfall on the budget when he had to go to the Assembly to be bailed out was 90 million on a 900 million budget That means with a budget prepared for 900 million in expenditures he was short 90 million He says that the fuel oil tax cost him 26 million of that 90 theres still a good deal more shortfall in the total 90 million Nassau County was closer to bankruptcy with a 10 percent shortfall than New York City was when New York City had to go to the Federal Government for a bailout Mr Purcell says that its hard to predict whats going to happen But yet that is the job of the County Executive to predict to budget and to come in as close to the numbers that you budget as possible Having 90 million shortfalls or 25 million surpluses is not good budgeting Im telling the people of Nassau County that I can cut the tax rate in Nassau County by 20 percent I can do that by a spending and a hiring freeze I can do that by attrition of 25 to 3 percent on about 7000 county jobs And it will work out to a cut in the tax rate of 20 percent VUOLO I think the way to bring the county budget into line is to get rid of all the superfluous positions that Im sure are present I dont think those positions would change very much if Mr Matthews is elected Im sure patronage would still be given and the county would wind up in the same spot as it is now OLCHIN Mr Matthews makes statements about what hes going to cut in order to reduce the tax base but I have yet to hear any specifics When twothirds of the county spending is mandated by the state are we going to take funds away from parks senior citizens road repairs police I dont see how the tax base can be cut PURCELL I held some meetings about two weeks ago in the afternoon and in the evening so people could come Thirtyone people came to express their opinion on the budget John Matthews the County Executive candidate of one of the major political parties did not even come and recommend either a penny cut or a penny addition He was conspicuous by his absence because he could have said to Purcell cut this cut that do this or do that He did not want to be on the record to say that any one of the 52 different programs which we have in the county should be cut The mandates that we get Medicaid 45 million the bus subsidies of about 38 million the handicapped childrens program which I am not criticizing because nobody knows better what a handicapped child can be in a burden on the family When I became County Executive in 1977 our input into that from the state mandate was 27 million Our bill for handicapped children this year in the budget I have just prepared is over 21 million that I have to by law put in that budget Where would you cut Why dont you say what youre going to do to senior citizens what youre going to do to the Parks Department what youre going to do to the infrastructure Tell us what youre going do in day care MATTHEWS Im glad you brought that up because you were not going to fund it four years ago until I made you fund it PURCELL You make me  you werent even at the meeting MATTHEWS Mr Purcell I marched with the daycare people to get you to put it on the record And I have you on videotape saying that PURCELL You dont understand Weve always had day care MATTHEWS I do understand I run a business just the way you run a county but I run my business better than the way you run this county PURCELL Thats your opinion Day care has always been in existence When every year weve increased the funding did you come and say anything about the hospital where we put in the detoxification unit and we put in extra money in there You didnt say anything whether it was good or bad MATTHEWS Mr Purcell as Ive said before theres more conflict in the Politburo than there is at the Board of Supervisors meetings in Nassau County And while you keep talking about all the mandates that you have from the state the state also gives you money this year to the tune of 66 million And Id just like everyone to know what the state gives you Theyve picked among some things 22 million for the courts 20 million for Medicaid 9 million for SSI 28 million for Youth Bureau and 49 million for local street and road repairs PURCELL Is Medicaid a negativism Is the bus subsidies of 38 million which we have to pay Is the maintenance of the Long Island Rail Road which we have to pay The public should know where their dollars go Unfortunately they dont And you dont know where they go because your ignorance on the budget amazes me for one who is running for the top job in Nassau County MATTHEWS The Democratic Party responded to that over the years which is one of the other reasons that we need a twoparty government in Nassau County The fact that I wasnt the spokesperson doesnt mean that the Democratic Party didnt have what we have had to say PURCELL There was nobody from the Democrat Party to those hearings morning or evening not one person MATTHEWS On your budget hearings last year Assemblyman Kremer came and gave you whatfor on how you were running the budget PURCELL Thats right Yes he did And I appreciate it and I respect him But Im not running against Kremer Im running against you FINAL STATEMENTS Q We have to go into the final statements OLCHIN The Liberal Party platform calls for a county legislature rather than the Board of Supervisors acting as a legislature That is true oneperson onevote principle We are for councilmanic districts which Mr Purcell differs with to ensure minority representation on town boards We are for public housing for moderate lowcost housing for senior citizens single parents and emancipated young persons That is a program in the positive nature We are for at least one night meeting a month for the Board of Supervisors We are for an increase in the number of bus routes and the frequency of buses in Nassau County We have a problem with our District Attorney in Nassau County  Denis Dillon He has gone down to abortion clinics to the hospitals and not as a private citizen but as the District Attorney of Nassau County Weve disavowed Denis Dillon We cannot get him off our line MATTHEWS Im running for County Executive because Im concerned about an historic principle that oneparty government does not work for the governed Twoparty government provides an opposition party as a watchdog for everyone in the county Mr Purcell was the Presiding Supervisor in the Town of Hempstead for the three years that the town was convicted of extortion People will not have to change their registrations in order to work in Nassau County People should not have to get jobs by how much money they give the party and they should not have to get jobs and keep jobs by changing their registration As the County Executive one of my first actions will be to use that office to close the dumps I will close every dump in Nassau County We will set up a solidwaste management program Well need authority from the state I will get the authority from the state but the county will be the leader in disposing of solid waste in Nassau County We will move the waste to areas where we will have stateoftheart recovery plants and the people of the county will know that theres leadership for a change PURCELL Ive been County Executive for 7 12 years Ive enjoyed it tremendously I think weve come a long way in the County of Nassau The economy is probably the best in the country Weve had a great deal of good construction Mitchel Field has provided about 20000 new jobs but more than that it has spilled over into Hempstead and Long Beach which have really come back and been revitalized There seems to be a good attitude on the part of the people in my travels throughout the county  the day care the senior citizens program our constant refurbishing of the roads Weve put 7 million each year for nothing but refurbishing the roads And the park system is without parallel in the country we have one of the finest park systems which is used by many many people On the balance of power that Mr Matthews talks about  the balance of power is something that I think exists Perhaps on the board the voting is weighed in the Republican fashion but when people go into the voting booth they have a right to put anybody that they want in there In our State Legislature we have a good many good Democrats who do a lot for our county We have two people from the Democratic Party who are serving on the board and both of their voices can be heard and I think thats not a problem Mr Matthews talks about getting rid of the garbage Very simple if you have a Governor that cooperates and a State Legislature that cooperates The Assembly has held back in the Bethpage area One of the biggest problems in the nation today is solid waste disposal and there is no easy solution You cannot landfill it you cannot put it on the land we know that and I think thats good You cant burn it because no one wants an incinerator in their area So its so simple for John to say were going to just get rid of it in Westchester and in Albany like he said a couple of weeks ago If I was living in Westchester Id be waiting for that first truck to pull in VUOLO Im a candidate in this election because abortion is the most important issue here Seventeen million lives of unborn children have been taken in our country since abortion was instituted by the Supreme Court in 1973 And there isnt any doubt about the fact that the unborn is alive and human Theres no scientific evidence contrary to that And as a consequence of this deprecation of human life were seeing newborns thrown into ashcans and handicapped newborn infants being deprived of medical care and were seeing qualityoflife decisions being made in the county in our nation all over And as a consequence of that people are dying All of my opponents are in favor of abortion on demand and Mr Olchin goes farther  he even wants to deprive us of the right to dissent from the abortion clinics
THE REGION;   JACK KEMP'S WAR CHEST GROWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/weekinreview/the-region-jack-kemp-s-war-chest-grows.html,In his eight terms as a Congressman from suburban Buffalo Jack F Kemp had never held a fundraising event outside his district He altered his strategy last week in a big way More than 1000 people dressed in black tie and evening gowns paid 1000 each to attend a dinner for the Republican Representative at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel in New York An additional 700000 was pledged by people who could not attend Since Mr Kemp has never spent more than 530000 on a campaign for reelection to the House he was not coy about his intentions testing the Presidential waters for 1988 A former professional football quarterback and a leading figure in the Republican Partys conservative wing Mr Kemp has been crisscrossing the country for more than a year paying special attention to states with early Presidential primaries or caucuses As he has for years he has been calling for reinvigorating the economy through tax cuts and an overhaul of the monetary system He has also begun to emphasize social issues including his opposition to abortion Members of his staff say they hope his positions will help differentiate Mr Kemp from another active but unannounced candidate Vice President Bush
ELECTIONS TUESDAY FOCUS ON 2 STATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/us/elections-tuesday-focus-on-2-states.html,Voters in Virginia and New Jersey will elect Governors Tuesday in contests that are being watched by both Democrats and Republicans eager to glimpse the political future as President Reagans dominance of American politics begins to wane And voters in dozens of cities including New York Detroit Seattle Miami and Houston will be electing mayors and other officials For the most part city elections turn on local issues and personalities But the mayoral race in Houston has attracted outside attention because of an attempt by opponents of homosexuals to make a political issue out of growing public concern over acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS Focus on Races for Governor The attention of Washington political circles will be focused on the two contests for Governor Some campaign strategists say the contests have already provided valuable lessons for both parties in their struggle to understand and manage the changes in voter attitudes and party allegiance that are part of Mr Reagans legacy Democrats in Virginia and Republicans in New Jersey are basically following a similar strategy in an attempt to expand their voting coalitions Their candidates for Governor are stressing fiscal conservatism compassion for human needs education economic development and efficient management of the state government In neither state have any social issues including abortion figured prominently in the political debate Lee Atwater a top strategist for Vice President Bush said the campaigns in both states illustrated what he called the new synthesis taking place in American politics that would require both parties to turn to new ideas and new coalitions in future elections In New Jersey Governor Kean a 50yearold Republican who won the office four years ago by only 1797 votes of 23 million cast appears headed for a strong victory over his Democratic challenger Peter Shapiro the 33yearold chief executive of Essex County Some New Jesey Democrats are concerned that Mr Keans popularity could help Republicans win control of the General Assembly where Democrats hold an eightseat majority and score major gains at the county level The Politics of Consensus Republican strategists say Governor Kean has expanded the 1984 Reagan coalition in the state to include blacks union members and others who usually vote Democratic Roger J Stone Jr a Washingtonbased Republican strategist whose clients include Mr Kean and Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York a likely contender for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1988 said the message of the New Jersey campaign for his party was that the politics of consensus work better than the politics of polarization The old political wisdom was if you had one group you had to forfeit another he added But I think New Jersey shows that you can be a candidate of traditional values and still be for expanded opportunities for minorities and that you can be a fiscal conservative and still be compassionate That is the message for the national parties In the Virginia campaign Democrats are trying to put together a coalition of blacks and conservative whites to counter the rolling realignment that once bode well for Republican candidates in the Old Dominion and other Southern states They have put forward a historic ticket including a candidate for Lieutenant Governor who is the first black nominated for state office in Virginia by a major party since Reconstruction and a woman running for Attorney General Gerald L Baliles 45 the Democratic candidate for Governor and his running mates have tied themselves closely to Gov Charles S Robb a popular Democrat who is ineligible to run again this year Statewide polls show Mr Baliles comfortably leading his Republican opponent Wyatt B Durrette 47 who has closely identified himself with the Presidents policies Faced with the conservative cast of the Democratic ticket Republicans have concentrated their attacks on State Senator L Douglas Wilder the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor in an attempt to portray the opposition as liberals and big spenders But some who follow politics closely say that strategy appears to have failed primarily because the Democratic candidates have wrapped themselves in Mr Robbs popularity Robb Victory a Turning Point The reference point for this race is the Robb administration not the national Democratic Party said Thomas R Morris a political science professor at the University of Richmond As a result he said Republicans have not been able to draw sharp philosophical distinctions between themselves and the Democrats The election of Mr Robb in 1981 broke a 12year string of Republican gubernatorial victories and in the view of some state politicians marked a turning point for Virginia Democrats In some major respects the Robb record bears some striking similarities to the Kean administration in New Jersey Both men are fiscal conservatives who have stressed programs to create jobs and have made costly efforts to improve public education Both have appointed record numbers of blacks to state posts and have reached out to members of minority groups in other ways On social issues both support the death penalty and believe a woman has a right to an abortion Eddie Mahe a Republican analyst who works in Washington and lives in suburban Virginia said I pick up no discontent with Chuck Robb in Virginia If he were running for reelection I think hed be as strong as Kean is in New Jersey Virginia is one of three states that still prohibit consecutive terms the others are Kentucky and Mississippi Sharp Debate in Houston Mr Mahe said he was struck by the way Virginia Democrats had distanced themselves from their national party The word Democrat does not appear in Mr Baliless campaign literature and television commercials In addition Mr Baliles following the Governors example did not ask for or receive the endorsement of the state chapter of the AFLCIO In one of the few other races that have attracted national attention voters in Houston will elect a Mayor and City Council members in a campaign that at times has been marked by a sharp debate over homosexual rights and AIDS An antihomosexual slate of local candidates using the name the straight slate will be listed on the ballot Most of the victims of AIDS which is usually fatal have been male homosexuals or intravenous drug users Mayor Kathy Whitmire the Democratic incumbent seeking her third twoyear term has been criticized by her opponent Louie Welch for stopping at a homosexual bar among other places to celebrate her 1981 victory The Miami race features Maurice A Ferre the sixterm incumbent in a nonpartisan primary The main challengers hoping to force a runoff are Raul Masvidal a banker and Xavier Suarez a lawyer In the Seattle race Mayor Charles Royer faces Norman Rice president of the City Council
HOW TO GET THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT MOVING AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/magazine/how-to-get-the-womens-movement-moving-again.html,THIS IS ADDRESSED TO ANY WOMAN who has ever said we about the womens movement including those who say Im not a feminist but    And its addressed to quite a few men Its a personal message not at all objective and its in response to those who think our modern womens movement is over  either because it is defeated and a failure or because it has triumphed its work done its mission accomplished After all any daughter can now dream of being an astronaut after Sally Ride or running for President after Geraldine Ferraro I do not think that the job of the modern womens movement is done And I do not believe the movement has failed For one thing those of us who started the modern womens movement or came into it after marriage and children or from jobs as invisible women in the office still carry the glow of it changed my whole life an aliveness the satisfaction of finding our own voice and power and the skills we didnt have a chance to develop before I do believe though that the movement is in trouble I was too passionately involved in its conception its birth its growing pains its youthful flowering to acquiesce quietly to its going gently so soon into the night But like a lot of other mothers I have been denying the symptoms of what I now feel forced to confront as a profound paralysis of the womens movement in America And this in turn has forced me to think about how we can get the womens movement moving again  a new round of consciousnessraising for instance or utilizing the networks of professional women or ceasing the obsession with the matter of pornography I see as symptoms of the paralysis the impotence in the face of fundamentalist backlash the wasting of energy in internal power struggles when no real issues are at stake the nostalgic harking back to old rhetoric old ideas old modes of action instead of confronting new threats and new problems with new thinking the failure to mobilize the young generation who take for granted the rights we won and who do not defend those rights as they are being taken away in front of our eyes and the preoccupation with pornography and other sexual diversions that do not affect most womens lives I sense an unwillingness to deal with the complex realities of female survival in malemodeled careers with the new illusions of having it all in marriage and equality in divorce and with the basic causes of the grim feminization of poverty The potential of womens political power is slipping away between the poles of selfserving feminist illusion and male and female opportunism The promise of that empowerment of women that enabled so many of us to change our own lives is being betrayed by our failure to mobilize the next generation to move beyond us EVIDENCE OF THE MOVEMENTS paralysis has been impinging on my own life in many ways Over the last few years Ive noticed how the machinery for enforcing the laws against sex discrimination in employment and education has been gradually dismantled by the Reagan Administration and how the laws scope has been narrowed by the courts with little public outcry Professional lobbyists for womens organizations objected of course but there have been no mass protests from the women in the jobs and professions that those laws opened to them In the early days of the National Organization for Women nearly 20 years ago we demanded and won an executive order banning Government contracts to companies or institutions guilty of sex discrimination it was the first major weapon women could use to demand jobs Some officials in the Administration are proposing the orders elimination The Reagan Administration is also urging the courts to undo recent movement victories regarding equal pay for work of comparable value The crusade against womens right to choice in the matter of childbirth and abortion preached from the pulpits of fundamentalist churches and by the Catholic hierarchy first achieved a ban on Federal aid to poor women seeking abortion then the elimination of United States Government aid to thirdworld familyplanning programs that counsel abortion The Attorney General announced this summer he would seek to reverse the historic Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade which 12 years ago decreed that the right of a woman to decide according to her own conscience when and whether and how many times to bear a child was as basic a right as any the Constitution originally spelled out for men At a recent meeting to mobilize women in mass communications to help save that right I was amazed to hear a onetime radical feminist suggest that abortion should not be defended in terms of a womans right Womens rights are not chic in America anymore she argued The main interest of many feminist groups in various states in recent years seems to be outlawing pornography Laws prohibiting pornography as a form of sex discrimination and violation of civil rights have been proposed in Minnesota Indiana California and New York A former NOW leader who practices law in upstate New York was startled when she dropped in on a feminist fundraiser to be asked to support a nationwide ban on sexually explicit materials When she warned A law like that would be far more dangerous to women than the most obscene pornography she was greeted with incomprehension and hostility At a blacktie banquet at the Plaza Hotel in New York in September I proudly watched a sparkling parade of champion women athletes as they entertained the corporate donors who sponsor their games and scholarships through the 11yearold Womens Sports Foundation The women champions in basketball judo gymnastics tennis skiing swimming boxing running and sportscar and dogsled racing paraded down the runway in sequined miniskirts and satin jumpsuits clasping their hands over their heads in the victory gesture They gave credit to parents and teachers but not one mentioned the recent Supreme Court decision regarding Grove City College in Pennsylvania That decision threatens to remove school athletic programs from the protection of the law banning sex discrimination in Federally assisted education  which is what provided crucial athletic training to these new female champions in the first place At another reception of one of the many new networks of women corporate executives a woman in her late 30s holding a job a woman had never been given before in a large insurance company told me If my slot became open today they wouldnt give it to a woman Not because I havent done a good job  I keep getting raises But theyve stopped talking about getting more women on the board  or in the company The word has gone out from the White House They dont have to worry anymore about women and blacks Its over At a media womens reception for Christine Craft the last movement heroine to take a case to court against that particular mix of sex and age discrimination that threatens to impose a premature ceiling on the first generation of female broadcasters women now hitting their 40s many younger women competing for anchor jobs did not show up to support her At one company executives who faced classaction suits a decade ago now boast that their best new employees are the women They were shocked when one of their star superwomen on a rung very near the top became pregnant with her second child and announced she was quitting The boss even offered her an extended maternity leave which is not required by law or union contract but she quit anyway You may never have another chance like this her colleagues male and female protested Ill never have these years with my children again she answered Most of them did not understand They figured that whatever guilt or pressure she suffered trying to juggle baby and demanding job was her peculiar personal problem Another longtime feminist mother with three yuppie daughters banker lawyer talent agent  says regretfully Theyre not feminists    they take all that for granted She goes on to tell me that Janeys problem is her love life and her job and Anns is her kids and her job and Phyllis thinks maybe she should go back and get an MBA With all that and exercise class they dont have time for the meetings we used to go to Why do they have to be feminists when they never had to suffer like we did But the center for displaced housewives where this mother works  in a nottoosecure administrative job may close down soon because of a cutoff in Government funds for job training Seeking a parttime typist at 6000 a year the center was amazed to get more than 100 answers to a single ad including women with degrees and years of job experience Among the applicants was a longdivorced woman of retirement age who had served as a role model for feminist independence enjoying brief celebrity for the selfhelp book she had written about her first brave years alone Now she is applying for any kind of job typing sales  and has begun studying the ads for household help She is to put it bluntly desperate I have breakfast with two of my younger colleagues in the movement the best and brightest the kind that should be moving now into national leadership One tells me she is leaving for a new job in foreign affairs She has developed her womens rights office into such fine professional shape that any good pro can run it now She needs a new purpose room to grow The other barely 30 has the professional skills honed during 10 years of service to the womens movement but is not interested in the movement job Whats the use of all this professionalism if the grassroots movement isnt there she shrugs Whats wrong with it I ask Theres a yearning for the same old music the same old marches by the ones who still meet in the church basements she says But they are the desperate ones the lonely ones and the pros like myself who still make some kind of living off the movement Lets face it the yuppies  I hate that word  who are in the halfway decent jobs that the movement opened to women dont relate to the old rhetoric The new professional networks which supposedly help them get ahead dont even pretend to be feminist anymore Thinking of my own daughterthedoctor and my daughterinlaw the editormother I realize how much more complex confident vital and pressured their lives are than ours were Their problems putting it all together keep them too busy to go to meetings But are their problems as serious as those of the desperate housewives and the invisible women in the offices 20 years ago Or as serious as those of the women struggling alone for economic and emotional survival today Do women who are moving ahead in their own lives have less in common with the desperate ones Do they even want to deny the very possibility of that desperation We were all pretty desperate then This last year books articles and notices of television programs have been piling up on my desk about these new problems of the postfeminist generation Smart Women Foolish Choices for instance and Lesser Lives This growing chorus expresses a personal disillusionment with maledefined careers a faintheartedness about having it all a rebellion against superwoman standards a sense of malaise or guilt or regret about prices paid in marriage or with children  and a recurring theme of not wanting to be like a man For most of this year NOW has been locked in a bitter vengeful internal power struggle Eleanor Smeal for whom the limit of a fouryear presidency of NOW had been waived for the duration of the equal rights amendment battle came out of retirement to run against her successor Judy Goldsmith in midterm She blamed her for NOWs depleted treasury and loss of members and demanded a return to street demonstrations for ERA and free choice in abortion Many older feminists who thought both had been good leaders for their time deplored the waste of energy in such a clash as powerful enemies were closing in Futile nostalgia for the radical marching tunes of another day will not enlist a new generation in different circumstances to save the rights now being taken away But the weakening of the organization and the longing for the old sense of empowerment are real enough  and not likely to be solved by recriminations that unfortunately continue to divide NOW since Eleanor Smeals return to power A WARE OF THESE symptoms and yet denying my own sense that the American womens movement was over not ready to admit defeat but wanting to move on to other things myself I went to Kenya last summer out of a sheer sense of historic duty to see the thing through to its end Most cardcarrying American feminists were not even bothering with the meeting in Nairobi NOW had scheduled its own convention in New Orleans at the same time as the United Nations World Conference of Women Ten years earlier when the modern womens movement was spreading from America to the world I had joined women wanting to organize in their countries in appealing to the UN to call a world assembly of women At the first two world womens meetings in Mexico in 1975 and Copenhagen in 1980 I had seen the beginnings of international networking among women broken up by organized disrupters led by armed gunmen shouting slogans against imperialism and Zionism I had been appalled at the way the official male delegates from Arab countries and other thirdworld and Communist nations that control the UN showed contempt for womens rights using those conferences mainly to launch a new doctrine of religious and ethnic hate equating Zionism and racism And I had been repelled by the way the delegates from Western countries mostly male officials or their wives and female flunkies let them thereby rob those conferences of the moral and political weight they might have given to the advance of women worldwide This year the United States delegation had instructions from President Reagan to walk out if the question of Zionism was included in the conclusions reached at Nairobi To my amazement the womens movement emerged in Nairobi with sufficient strength worldwide to impose its own agenda of womens concerns over the male political agenda that had divided it before Despite or because of the backlash and other problems they face at home nearly 17000 women from 159 nations assembled some 14000 having paid their own way or been sent by volunteer church or womens groups to the unofficial forum that is part of every such UN conference Some traveled by plane three and four days or by bus from African villages There was a bypassing or bridging of the old abstract ideological conflicts that had seemed to divide women before  a moving beyond the old rhetoric of career versus family equality versus development feminism versus socialism religion versus feminism or feminism as an imperialist capitalist arrogance irrelevant to poor thirdworld women What took the place of all this was a discussion of concrete strategies for women to acquire more control of their lives Thirdworld revolutionaries Arab and Israeli women as well as Japanese Greeks and Latins gathered under a baobab tree where every day at noon like some African tribal elder I led a discussion on Future Directions of Feminism We shared common concerns about how to move ahead and earn a living in mans world  as women even in African villages now have to do  without losing even using ones best values and strengths as women We talked about how to keep forging ahead as women when other questions  like the IsraeliArab conflict or the superpowers nucleararms race  are preoccupying our nations and using up their resources We shared ideas on how to keep advancing even underground when fundamentalist groups try to take away a womans right to control her own body or to move independently in the world as they are doing in Egypt and the United States and have done in Iran When the blackveiled Iranian women in their chadors and with their armed male guards occupied my tree one day we moved to another and when they occupied both trees we carried on our dialogue in the sun Thats the way women have to move now everywhere in the world I said We go forward we get pushed back we regroup Its not a winlose battle to be finished in any year And we dont waste energy on nonessentials said an African teacher At the official UN conference in Nairobi American women delegates mainly Republicans led by Maureen Reagan the Presidents daughter were working the hall for consensus on forwardlooking strategies on equality that included things American feminists hardly dare dream of in Reagans Washington  parental leave child care family planning and an economic value for womens work in home and field counted in a nations GNP as well as equal pay for work of comparable value Many of the other delegations from European Latin American African and Asian nations were now led by or included women who had been fighting for womens rights at home Ninety percent of the worlds governments have set up national bodies for the advancement of women most of them in this last decade while ours in the United States have been dismantled At Nairobi when Arab and Communist delegations engaged as usual in antiZionist and antiimperialist rhetoric these strong women delegates especially the Africans kept warning that the women of the world would condemn those who blocked consensus on equality And they forced the male diplomats to negotiate round the clock until they deleted that antiZionist expression of hate that has been ritual at every UN conference since 1975 To the amazement of experts a program involving forwardlooking strategies to advance women to equality was adopted by consensus of the nations of the world calling on the UN to implement them and to report back to another world assembly of women before the year 2000 I and other Americans  as many black as white among the 2000 of us at Nairobi went home strengthened resolved not to accept backwardnation status for American women For though we had gone to Nairobi subdued by our own setbacks and sophisticated enough not to offer Western feminism as the answer to the problems of women of the third world it was truly humiliating to discover that we are no longer the cutting edge of modern feminism or world progress toward equality Even Kenya has an equal rights clause in its Constitution  HOW CAN WE LET THE WOMENS movement die out here in America when what we began is taking hold now all over the world I would like to suggest 10 things that might be done to break the blocks that seem to have stymied the womens movement in America 1 BEGIN A NEW ROUND OF CONsciousnessraising for the new generation These women each thinking she is alone with her personal guilt and pressures trying to have it all having second thoughts about her professional career desperately trying to have a baby before it is too late with or without husband and maybe secretly blaming the movement for getting her into this mess are almost as isolated and as powerless in their isolation as those suburban housewives afflicted by the problem that had no name whom I interviewed for The Feminine Mystique over 20 years ago Those women put a name to their problem they got together with other women in the new feminist groups and began to work for political solutions and began to change their lives That has to happen again to free a new generation of women from its new double burden of guilt and isolation The guilts of lessthanperfect motherhood and lessthanperfect professional career performance are real because its not possible to have it all when jobs are still structured for men whose wives take care of the details of life and homes are still structured for women whose only responsibility is running their families I warned five years ago that if the womens movement didnt move into a second stage and take on the problems of restructuring work and home a new generation would be vulnerable to backlash But the movement has not moved into that needed second stage so the women struggling with these new problems view them as purely personal not political and no longer look to the movement for solutions Putting new names to their problems they might stop feeling guilty for not being able to conduct their professional lives just like men might give each other support in new patterns of professional advance and parenting might together demand new political solutions of parental leave and child care from company or profession or community or even once again from government They might then find new energy to save the rights they now take for granted or even secretly resent because they are so hard to live with 2 MOBILIZE THE NEW PROFESSIONAL networks and the old established volunteer organizations to save womens rights We cant fight fundamentalist backlash with backwardlooking feminist fundamentalism Secondstage feminism is itself pluralistic and has to use new pluralist strengths and strategies The women who have been 30 and 40 percent of the graduating class from law school or business school and 47 percent of the journalism school classes the ones whove taken womens studies the women who grew up playing Little League baseball and cheered on those new champion women athletes the new professional networksof women in every field every woman who has been looking to those networks only to get ahead in her own field must now use her professional skills to save the laws and executive orders against sex discrimination in education and employment They must restore the enforcement machinery and the classaction suits that opened up all these opportunities to her in the first place The volunteer organizations it became clear in Nairobi have been given new goals and gumption and professional expertise by the womens movement Let NOW heal its internal wounds and join with these other groups as it did in the ERA struggle to face the current emergency rather than indulge in wishful thinking about refighting the ERA battle 3 GET OFF THE PORNOGraphy kick and face the real obscenity of poverty No matter how repulsive we may find pornography laws banning books or movies for sexually explicit content could be far more dangerous to women The pornography issue is dividing the womens movement and giving the impression on college campuses that to be a feminist is to be against sex More important it is diverting energies that need to be spent saving the basic rights now being destroyed Karen DeCrow who once was elected president of NOW on the slogan Out of the mainstream into the revolution wrote a recent article entitled Strange Bedfellows for Penthouse She pointed out that the new feministsupported proposals to make pornography an illegal violation of the civil rights of women have an unlookedfor effect They aid the far right agenda that would also ban the teaching of evolution in schools prohibit a womans right to choose abortion cut Government funding for textbooks that portray women in nontraditional roles and repeal Federal statutes against spouse and child abuse What is behind some womens obsession with pornography Womens sexuality has been distorted and suppressed in almost every society we learned at Nairobi and that suppression has gone hand in hand with a general attempt to deny women freedom to control their own lives to move and earn independently in society Pornography and also the crusade to suppress pornography reduce women to a single dimension defining them as only passive sex objects not people who can run their own lives But I think the secret this obsession with pornography may mask for women alone for aging women and for women still more economically dependent on men than they would like is fear of poverty which is the ultimate obscenity for Americans I sat at a dinner table recently with several women who I know are struggling personally with these problems and could not believe their venom against the young rock star Madonna I suggested that teenagers identified with her gutsiness strength and independence as well as with her notatallpassive sexuality which to me was not a retreat from womens liberation but a celebration of it Whoever said that feminism shouldnt be sexy They were women in their 40s 50s and 60s and they virtually spat in disgust Perhaps an unspoken reason so many women are protesting sexually explicit materials is that their own sexuality is denied by society But I suspect that as long as sex is distorted by womens economic dependence or fear of it it cant be truly freely enjoyed The obscenity that not even many feminists want to confront in personal terms is the sheer degradation of being poor in opulent upwardly mobile America Of course the womens movement in America like all such revolutions everywhere has been mainly a middleclass movement but the shameful secret it has never really dealt with is the fact that more and more middleclass women are sinking into poverty Americas first movement for womens rights died out after winning the vote four generations ago because women didnt tackle the hard political tasks of restructuring home and work so that women who married and had children could also earn and have their own voice in the decisionmaking mainstream of society Instead those women retreated behind a cultural curtain of female purity focusing their energies on issues like prohibition much like the pornographic obsession of some feminists today 4 CONFRONT THE ILLUsion of equality in divorce Economists and feminists have been talking a lot lately about the feminization of poverty in theoretical terms but the American womens movement has not developed concrete strategies that get at its root cause Its not just a question of women earning less than men though as long as women do not get equal pay for work of comparable value or earn Social Security or pensions for taking care of children and home they are both economically dependent on marriage and motherhood and pay a big economic price for it And this is as true for divorced aging yuppies as for welfare mothers A startling new book by the sociologist Lenore J Weitzman The Divorce Revolution The Unexpected Social and Economic Consequences for Women and Children in America reveals that in the 1970s when 48 states adopted nofault divorce laws treating men and women equally in divorce settlements laws feminists originally supported  divorced women and their children suffered an immediate 73 percent drop in their standard of living while their exhusbands enjoyed a 42 percent rise in theirs In dividing marital property Lenore Weitzman reports judges have systematically overlooked the major assets of many marriages the husbands career assets that the wife helped make possible his professional education that she may have helped support the career on which he was able to concentrate because she ran the home and his salary pension health insurance and earning power that resulted They have also ignored the wifes years of unpaid housework and child care not totally insured by Social Security in the event of divorce and her drastically diminished job prospects after divorce And for most the equal division of property means the forced sale of the family home  which used to be awarded to the wife and children Child support which has often been inadequate unpaid and uncollectable usually ends when the child is 18 just as college expenses begin Thus the vicious cycle whereby an everincreasing majority of the truly poor in America are families headed by women A new generation of feminist lawyers and judges has now drafted and must get urgent grassroots political support for the kind of law needed a law that treats marriage as a true economic partnership  and includes fairer standards of property division maintenance and child support It should be a law that does not penalize women who have chosen family over or even together with professional career 5 RETURN THE ISSUE OF abortion to the matter of womens own responsible choice I think feminists have been so traumatized by the fundamentalist crusade against abortion and all the talk of fetuses and when life begins that they are in danger of forgetting the values that made abortion a feminist issue in the first place Underneath the hysteria poll after poll shows that the great majority of women in this nation and most men still want to decide when and whether to have a child in accordance with their own conscience This includes women of faith including the majority of Catholic women Attacks on the Pope and picketing the churches as some desperate or deranged male and female abortion champions have lately proposed would play right into the hands of our right to life enemies who love to paint feminists as satanic opponents of God and family We must not surrender family values and religious principles to the far right Let the new women theologians and feminist women of faith in every church take on the fundamentalist preachers I think women who are young and those not so young today must be able to choose when to have a child given the necessities of their jobs They will indeed join their mothers who remember the humiliations and dangers of backstreet butcher abortions in a march of millions to save the right of legal abortion I certainly support a march for womens choice of birth control and legal aborion NOW has called for one in the spring of 1986 6 AFFIRM THE DIFFERences between men and women New feminist thinking is required if American women are to continue advancing in mans world as they must to earn their way and yet not become like men This fear is heard with more and more frequency today from young women including many who have succeeded and some who have failed or opted out of maledefined careers More books like Carol Gilligans In a Different Voice and consciousnessraising sessions are needed Firststage feminism denied real differences between women and men except for the sexual organs themselves Some feminists still do not understand that true equality is not possible unless those differences between men and women are affirmed and until values based on female sensitivities to life begin to be voiced in every discipline and profession from architecture to economics where until recently all concepts and standards were defined by men This is not a matter of abstract theory alone but involves the restructuring of hours of work and patterns of professional training so that they take into account the fact that women are the people who give birth to children It must lead to concrete changes in medical practice church worship the writing of history standards of ethics even the design of homes and appliances 7 BREAKTHROUGH FOR older women The womens movement has never put serious energy into the job that must be done to get women adequately covered by Social Security and pensions especially those women now reaching 65 who spent many years as housewives and are ending up alone The need for more independent and shared housing for older women now living alone in suburban houses they cant afford to sell or lonely furnished rooms  and the need for services and jobs or volunteer options that will enable them to keep on living independent productive lives  has never been a part of the womens movement agenda But that first generation of feminist mothers women now in their 60s is a powerful political resource for the movement as these women retire from late or early professional or volunteer careers Women in their 50s and 60s are shown by the polls to be more firmly committed than their daughters to the feminist goals of equality Let the womens movement lead the rest of society in breaking the spell of the youth cult and drawing on the still enormous energies and the wisdom that may come to some of us in age 8 BRING IN THE MEN ITS passe surely for feminists now to see men only as the enemy or to contemplate separatist models for emotional or economic survival Feminist theorists like Barbara Ehrenreich cite dismal evidence of the new men opting out of family responsibilities altogether But in my own life I seem to see more and more young men and older ones  even former male chauvinist pigs  admitting their vulnerability and learning to express their tenderness sharing the care of the kids even though most of them may never share it equally with their wives And as men let down their masks of machismo and admit their dependence on the women in their lives women may admit a new need to depend on men without fear of sinking back into the old abject subservience After all even women who insist they are not and never will be feminists have learned to defend themselves against real male brutality Look at Charlotte Donahue Fedders the wife of that Security and Exchange commissioner who testified in divorce court about his repeated abuse  his repeated beatings caused black eyes and a broken eardrum At one time a woman in her situation would have kept that shame a secret The Reagan Administration had to ask him to resign because wifebeating is no longer politically acceptable even in conservative America in 1985 I dont think women can or should try to take the responsibility for liberating men from the remnants of machismo But there has to be a new way of asking what do men really want to echo Freud a new kind of dialogue that breaks through or gets behind both our masks Women cannot restructure jobs or homes just by talking to themselves 9 CONTINUE TO FIGHT for real political power Although feminists do not now and never really did support a woman just because she is a woman there is no substitute for having women in political offices that matter But more women are discovering that they have to fight as men do in primaries where victory is not certain and not just wait for an open seat After the ERAs defeat feminists and their supporters raised money nationally to run women candidates in virtually every district in Illinois Florida and North Carolina where legislators voted against the amendment And in that single election they increased sizably womens representation in those state legislatures 10 MOVE BEYOND SINgleissue thinking Even today I do not think womens rights are the most urgent business for American women The important thing is somehow getting together with men who also put the values of life first to break through the paralysis that fundamentalist backlash has imposed on all our movements It is not only feminism that is becoming a dirty word in America but also liberalism humanism pluralism environmentalism and civil liberties The very freedom of political dissent that enabled the womens movement to start here has been made to seem unsafe for todays young men as well as young women I think the yuppies are afraid to be political Women may have to think beyond womens issues to join their energies with men to redeem our democratic tradition and turn our nations power to the interests of life instead of the nuclear arms race that is paralyzing it Ive never for instance seen the need for a separate womens peace movement Im not really sure that women by nature are more peaceloving than men They were simply not brought up to express aggression the way men do they took it out covertly on themselves and on their men and children psychologists would say But the human race may not survive much longer unless women move beyond the nurture of their own babies and careers to politcial decisions of war and peace and unless men who share the nurture of their children take responsibility for ending the arms race before it destroys all life In that sense I think the womens movement is only a particular moment in human evolution and once its job is really done then it can and should be allowed to fade away

MAYORAL RACES TOP TUESDAY'S BALLOTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/nyregion/mayoral-races-top-tuesdays-ballots.html,MAYORS of Connecticuts major cities will be seeking to keep their jobs Tuesday as voters in 136 municipalities go to the polls in elections for chief executive In 26 cities and towns referendums will be on the ballot  among them Bristols nonbinding referendum on the Supreme Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion The vote the first of its kind in the country will be watched closely No one really knows how you win one of these things said a state lobbyist involved in the campaign Peoples feelings on the issue are very private and difficult to gauge Offyear elections like those this year  without candidates for state or national office  are commonly thought to draw only a few voters to the polls But this is something of a canard according to Joseph Loy assistant to the elections attorney in the Secretary of the States office In the 1982 election for example about 57 percent of Connecticuts registered voters went to the polls compared with 675 percent in the 1982 gubernatorial and United States Senate election and 824 percent in last years Presidential election Some of this years local races have been enlivened by unaffiliated and thirdparty campaigns said Sheila Wartel the voterservices director of the states League of Women Voters Moreover about 50 women are candidates for mayor or first selectman some of them spurred by Geraldine A Ferraros Vice Presidential candidacy last fall Mrs Wartel said Women were getting ahead at a grassroots level and have used that as an example she said Twentyfive unaffiliated and thirdparty slates are seeking a officesthis year The parties range from the freemarket Libertarian Party and the antinuclear environmentalist Green Party to a Bull Moose Party in Oxford which takes its name from Theodore Roosevelt shortlived Progressive Party of 1912 We figured it was a name people would remember said the Bull Moose candidate for first selectman Town Fire Marshall Frederick Palmer Thirdparty candidates have injected more issues and positions into local campaigns Mrs Wartel observed even in cases where they stand little chance of winning The name of a third party in Bridgeport  the Integrity Party sums up the issue all three mayoral candidates say divides them in a city wracked by controversies in the Police Department and elsewhere in recent years The Integrity Party candidate the Rev William R Bulkley said The climate of Bridgeport politics is one of dishonesty conspiracy and doubledealing Life is more meaningful than less or more in your pocket The incumbent Mayor Leonard S Paoletta a Republican has linked the Democratic challenger Thomas Bucci with former Mayor John Mandinici and the current Police Superintendent Joseph Walsh both of whom have been the subject of numerous investigations Both have endorsed Mr Bucci Mr Mandinici was defeated in a Democratic primary in 1983 and again this year And Mr Walshs removal from office was sought by Mayor Paoletta in a highly publicized court case that ended with Mr Walsh retaining his job but losing most of his managing authority to the Board of Police Commissioners Mr Bucci has promised to restore Mr Walshs authority I dont believe a board of commissioners can operate a department day to day he said Mr Paoletta who is seeking to become Bridgeports first threeterm Republican mayor since the 20s said of Mr Bucci This individual has surrounded himself with the people who brought this city to the edge of ruin Mr Bucci a labor lawyer and former assistant city attorney said Mr Paoletta has been indulging in negative campaigning to divert attention from his record of failure including increased taxes and crime Mr Bucci also contended that Mr Paoletta improperly spent close to 1million in city funds on consulting and legal fees to remove Mr Walsh from office But the Mayor says the figure was was 267000 for court costs and legal fees and 101000 for a consultants study of the Police Department Mr Bucci has advocated applying for national police accreditation which he said would effectively identify deficiencies in the department and cost only 9000 He also called for the creation of an city ethics commission to examine the conduct of public officials Mr Paoletta said the accreditation process would not solve the Police Department problems Without written personnel policies or officers manuals or other standard written procedures the department requires a more rigorous fundamental independent review he said Accreditation is like taking an exam he said You have to have done your homework State lobbyists and observers say Bridgeport is one of the two closest and closely watched mayoral campaigns this year The other they say is in Hamden where the incumbent mayor Peter F Villano lost a heated Democratic primary race to a former aide who left his administration two years ago The challenger Gloria Sandillo is in an equally heated race against Councilman John P DeNicola a Republican Polls by both candidates show them within 10 percentage points of each other The two candidates both criticized Mr Villanos administration for tripling taxes over six years and mismanaging a municipal landfill currently the subject of a state police investigation But they differ over which candidate is more tied to those policies Mr DeNicola who has bought 200 spots on several cabletelevision channels for his five 15second ads said in an interview that Mrs Sandillo was definitely tied into the Villano administration because she served as the Town Clerk for four years He also criticized her for having campaigned with United States Representative Bruce A Morrison for whom she worked the last two years The voters must be asked Can she make her own decisions or will she be beholden to others Mr DeNicola said Mr DeNicola is worried the Congressmans popularity will rub off on me responded Mrs Sandillo whose campaign effort has focused on direct mail She said she had left Mr Villanos administration in 1983 in disagreement over his policies Indeed she says Mr DeNicola not she is partly responsible for those policies because as Councilman he didnt open his mouth about any of this until he ran for mayor Michael J Noonan state political director for the AFLCIO said the Hamden race was very interesting in the internal politics of the Democratic Party because of the uncertainty over whether Mr Villanos supporters will back Mrs Sandillo Nicholas Niehart executive director of the Legislative Electoral Action Program agreed the factional split had statewide implications In reference to the members of the Democratic Partys liberal wing which helped elect Representative Morrison he said Hamden is a real test of whether the kind of progressive machine being built there can have any effect beyond a Congressional campaign Other races while attracting less attention statewide have produced diverging views on local issues In Norwalk for instance the entrenched fourparty system has produced four mayoral candidates who at a recent debate before the Norwalk Clergy Association clashed on the notion of government compassion in the face of a development boom The incumbent Democrat William A Collins seeking his fourth term as Mayor proposed linkage laws and zoning changes to preserve affordable rental housing for the elderly young and poor to try to make sure Norwark doesnt lose its humanity in the face of all this progress He also said he was working on a comparable worth plan to insure fair pay for women who work for the city The Conservative Party candidate John Lombardi who like the other challengers opposes Mr Collinss notions on linkage and zoning changes said the real compassion issue was keeping taxes low for retirees people who have worked all their lives and are now being taxed Declaring vote for me and youll never be wrong the Republican contender Thomas OConnor told the clergymen that his role in a citizens protest helped drive the film Silent Night Deadly Night out of Norwalk because of its depiction of Santa Claus as a murderer showing his compassion toward the upbringing of local youth Richard Briggs the Independent Party candidate emphasized his record as Norwalk Schools Superintendent in establishing workstudy programs for the poor In New Haven as the League of Women Voters taped a debate at the Storer Cable companys studios one recent day the local league president Susan SicaGlover said this years mayoral race has evolved into a real issues race The first section of debate on New Havens growing downtown development illustrated her point The incumbent Mayor Biagio DiLieto said that in his six years as mayor downtown had changed from a ghost town to an entertainment district with a modern mall Those projects he said have drawn 260 million in private investment to the city The Green Party challenger Richard Wolff an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts criticized the glittery downtown projects that dont make money and said they had helped only the developers through tax breaks while increasing the tax burden on an already impoverished city He called for a bottom up approach to rebuilding New Haven through emphasis on refurbishing housing and upgrading city services especially the schools Then the Republican candidate Caroline Dinegar a political science professor at the University of New Haven offered a third vision of city development Unlike both Mr DiLieto and Mr Wolff she called for New Haven to forsake its downtown retail and entertainment businesses in favor of more corporate headquarters In New Haven as in most other Connecticut cities incumbents have far outspent their challengers this year In Hartford Mayor Thirman L Milner a Democrat faces a Republican challenger Eunice Strong Groark In Stamford Mayor Thom Serrani a Democrat is being challenged by Republican Richard H G Cunningham while in Waterbury Joseph J Santopietro a Republican opposes Mayor Edward D Bergin a Democrat
TEEN-AGERS TAKING RISKS: WHEN PREGNANCY IS THE RESULT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/04/us/teen-agers-taking-risks-when-pregnancy-is-the-result.html,LaTanya Jones had her first son Traziel three years ago and her second Steve six months ago I feel like an old lady already said the 16yearold student at DuSable High School on the citys South Side LaTanya and some of her fellow students are at the center of a citywide debate over a clinic at DuSable that along with providing general medical services to some of the citys most impoverished youths dispenses contraceptives The school is trying to deal with a problem that Doris M Williams coordinator of pregnancy prevention programs for the Chicago public schools confronts daily The biggest thing Mrs Williams said is that they just dont think its going to happen to them As my mother would say They dont believe fat meat is greasy They feel like they are invincible and they are risk takers Mixed Feelings In 1983 the last year for which statistics are available 10472 babies were born to teenagers in Chicago placing that city second only to New York with 13868 Nationally 524000 teenagers became mothers in 1983 10000 of them were under 14 Among those with differing opinions about the morality of a public school systems providing contraceptives to teenagers are Catherean Marshall a 46yearold West Side resident who has nine children ranging in age from 14 to 28 and her daughter Clarancia Lloyd who is 16 and pregnant Her baby due in December will be Mrs Marshalls 12th grandchild I have mixed feelings about it said Mrs Marshall On the one hand I think they shouldnt make it so easy for the children  babies I call them  to sleep around They make it a little bit too easy for them On the other hand she said I think the contraceptives are good Id much rather have them using these protective measures as opposed to them getting pregnant and doing away with the baby through abortions All but one of her first six children three girls and three boys have had children out of wedlock Clarancia now enrolled in the Simpson School one of the citys four alternative schools for pregnant girls is Mrs Marshalls seventh child Pickets at the School On the subject of whether the clinic will encourage promiscuity Clarancia said I feel that if theyre ready to do it theyre going to do it no matter what At the clinic they just give them some knowledge to help them Outside DuSable in a neighborhood where 408 babies were born in 1983 to girls of high school age pickets march Yasmeen Brown is director of Coordinating Opportunities for Parenting Education or COPE a statefinanced center that helps teenage parents deal with their children Picketing a school said Miss Brown looking toward DuSable from her office across the street certainly doesnt keep any of these kids from getting pregnant On a recent evening LaTanya attended a discussion group at the center along with a 17yearold named Lisa and an 18yearold Marian Mims Pills Were Thrown Away Lisa the mother of a 13monthold son had been sexually active for several years before briefly taking birth control pills when she was 15 Because she did not like them she said I threw mine away Both Marian who has a 2yearold son and a 1yearold daughter and LaTanya said they did not take precautions between their first and second pregnancies feeling confident that lightning could not possibly strike twice But it did After her first pregnancy Marian said her lover was ecstatic but then When I got pregnant with my second child he said Uhuh no this is too hard for me to handle Its time to walk And he walked Another young man Van Johnson 24 said he understood that father He and Linda Austin 20 are the parents of 1yearold twin daughters Youve Got to Work Hard He said For a lot of guys when you find out youre going to have a baby its like the end of the world or something Its hard to deal with the fact that its time to grow up Once you have the kid no more hanging out with partners Youve got to work hard make money Youve got to forget about yourself and sometimes its hard In addition he said many teenagers particularly blacks find it difficult if not impossible to get jobs In Chicago like other major cities programs ranging from the alternative high schools to COPE to the Chicago Urban League Young Parents Center are trying to help teenagers learn parental skills obtain daycare services and above all remain in school A major task according to experts is to identify girls most liable to early pregnancy and to work with them These include girls reared in poverty whose mothers or older sisters had children as teenagers Early pregnancies are closely linked to a greater likelihood that a teenager will drop out of high school that her baby will succumb to disease in its first year of life and that the young mother will become a welfare recipient Mother Was Disappointed Mrs Marshall whose two older daughters became teenage mothers before Clarancia did said I kind of thought maybe when the first ones got pregnant that it might have been my fault But after she got pregnant Mrs Marshall said of Clarancia I realized it was something that was going to happen No matter how tight a hold you keep them if they want to do it they are going to do it Both LaTanyas mother and Lisas were teenage parents She was disappointed Lisa said of her mothers reaction to her pregnancy because she got pregnant at a young age and she always wanted me to have a better life than her At times LaTanya said she becomes angry when she cannot go out with friends But then she said I just say Well I did it so I have to deal with it  Marian who is planning to marry a young man she met while in her second pregnancy said You look and say Well I could do this and I could do that if I didnt have any kids But I love them and I dont regret it LaTanya does regret it and said she would give this advice to her younger sisters who are 13 and 9 Go in a different direction than I did Most of all think about school right now and leave the boys behind because youll have time eventually for a family and for you and a boy to get together Unlike many urban teenage parents LaTanya and many of her friends at COPE have plans to finish high school or obtain general equivalency diplomas and then continue in trade schools or colleges They dream and on Thursday nights rather than watch The Cosby Show on television they meet at COPE to talk about the joys and frustrations of being parents The only regret that I have is that I wasnt rich Van Johnson said adding If I was rich every day would be great Yeah Marian Mims agreed money is the key factor when it comes to having kids
CASE ON RIGHTS FOR HOMOSEXUALS WILL BE HEARD BY SUPREME COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/05/us/case-on-rights-for-homosexuals-will-be-heard-by-supreme-court.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Constitution protects consenting adults from prosecution for private homosexual acts The Courts unsigned order setting the case for a hearing next spring involves a homosexual man who challenged Georgias law against any oral or anal intercourse The case provides the Court with the opportunity to clarify the vaguely defined constitutional right of privacy that it has found among the emanations from various provisions of the Bill of Rights The Court has recognized this right over the last two decades in cases striking down states restrictions on contraception abortion and interracial marriage Lower courts around the country have rendered conflicting rulings on whether it encompasses homosexual activity If the Supreme Court chooses to issue a broad ruling it could also determine whether the law being challenged would be constitutional as applied to heterosexual acts The case accepted for review today Bowers v Hardwick No 85140 began as a civil suit by Michael Hardwick who was arrested while in his bedroom with another man and charged with sodomy The prosecution dropped the charge without going to trial Mr Hardwick then sued for a ruling that the law was unconstitutional Georgia appealed a Federal circuit courts ruling that the states sodomy law infringes upon the fundamental constitutional rights of Mr Hardwick to have private sexual relations Protecting Intimate Association Writing for a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Judge Frank M Johnson Jr said that private homosexual relationships involved an intimate association protected against state interference by the Constitution He said such relationships could sometimes serve the same purpose as the intimacy of marriage But other courts including the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have concluded that the Constitution does not protect private consenting homosexual activity The Supreme Courts ruling expected by July may shed light on the constitutionality of various forms of discrimination against homosexuals as well as resolving the fundamental issue of whether governments can criminalize homosexual relations It was widely thought that the Court resolved this issue in 1976 when it affirmed without an opinion explaining its reasoning a lower court decision upholding a nearly identical Virginia sodomy statute as applied to homosexuals But in recent years some courts including New York States highest have found that the Supreme Court did not intend its ruling to be the last word on the matter Rulings to the contrary include a decision in August by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which cited the Supreme Courts 1976 ruling and the strong objection to homosexual conduct which has prevailed in Western culture for the past seven centuries Drawing on 1976 Decision In the Hardwick case a Federal district judge upheld the law on the ground that the 1976 Supreme Court decision was a binding precedent But the appellate panel disagreed Judge Johnsons opinion stopped short of striking down the Georgia law but he indicated he would do so after further proceedings unless the state could show a compelling interest in restricting this right a virtually impossible barrier for any state The Georgia law defines sodomy as any sex act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another It provides a prison term of a year to 20 years and applies to heterosexual as well as homosexual relations A married man and woman joined Mr Hardwicks suit asserting that the law had chilled and deterred them from engaging in certain sex acts But because they had never been arrested the lower courts held they had no legal standing to sue Twentyfive states have laws similar to Georgias that criminalize homosexual relations and 19 of them also outlaw certain sex acts between men and women Thomas B Stoddard legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union said today He said all 50 states made homosexual sodomy a crime until 1962 an inheritance from a 16thcentury English statute punishing by death what it called the crime against nature But legislatures in 23 states including New Jersey and Connecticut have repealed these provisions since 1962 often as part of a braod recodification of their criminal statutes The highest courts of New York and Pennsylvania have declared that such laws violate the Federal Constitution Sodomy laws are rarely enforced even where they remain on the books in part because of the difficulty of proving violations But these criminal laws are of great symbolic importance to homosexual rights groups and civil libertarians as well as to groups that regard homosexual activity as immoral Consensual sodomy statutes are the keystone of the oppression of gay people Mr Stoddard said They are used to justify employment discrimination and discrimination in child custody and they cast an aura of criminality around homosexuality
HIGH COURT HEARS 2 ABORTION CASES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/06/us/high-court-hears-2-abortion-cases.html,Two major abortion cases came before the Supreme Court today in oral arguments that were marked more by legal fine points than ideological or political fervor Neither the lawyers who urged the Court to uphold Pennsylvania and Illinois laws restricting abortion nor any of the nine Justices suggested the Court should overrule its 12year line of precedents recognizing a constitutional right to have an abortion The Reagan Administration and its Solicitor General Charles Fried had urged the Court to do just that in a brief submitted in July as a friend of the court But Mr Fried was denied permission to participate in todays arguments The parties he supported with 30 minutes each to argue would not share their time with him And the Court on Sept 18 refused his somewhat unusual request for extra time to present the Administrations views The parties before the Court today confined themselves to disputing whether under the Courts precedents the Pennsylvania and Illinois abortion regulations were valid safeguards of the health of women and of viable fetuses or rather unconstitutional obstacles to legal abortion Both laws would require physicians performing lateterm abortions to use procedures designed to promote the survival of viable fetuses those that have developed enough to live outside the womb Records for the State The Pennsylvania law also requires physicians to keep certain records for the state and to give women seeking abortion specified information concerning risks and alternatives The Illinois law requires physicians who prescribe contraceptives that prevent development of fertilized eggs to tell their patients that these are abortifacients that cause fetal death The law did not specify what these methods were but the most common is the intrauterine device Opponents of the laws argued today as Federal appellate courts held in the two cases that these and other provisions were designed to discourage abortions that they would endanger the health of women undergoing lateterm abortions and that the Illinois law required doctors to endorse the states theory of life The procedural disputes batted back and forth by the lawyers stood in palpable contrast to the elemental religious and political fervor generated by the abortion issue around the country More than 200 people were standing in line outside the Court almost an hour before the first case was called And the files bulged with more than 20 briefs as friends of the court from groups supporting and opposing abortion Abortion rights groups have sent fundraising letters calling for help in combating the Reagan Administration pressure for the Court to abandon its abortion precedents something that experts agree there is little chance the Court will do in the pending cases Legal Standing Questioned When the arguments got under way Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens suggested in their questions that the Court might not need to grapple with the constitutionality of the Illinois law Justice Brennan said the same of the Pennsylvania law The three Justices questioned the legal standing of the parties now defending the Illinois law to pursue their appeal and Justice Brennan questioned whether the Pennsylvania case in which some issues had not been fully reviewed by the lower courts was ripe for Supreme Court review Deputy Attorney General Andrew S Gordon of Pennsylvania defended his states law as plainly constitutional and said a Federal appeals court in Philadelphia was plainly incorrect in striking it down But the State of Illinois without giving a reason did not appeal a ruling by a Federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down its abortion law That was done by Dennis J Horan a member of the board of the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund He argued that the law was designed to protect viable fetuses and women who did not want abortions and places no burden whatsoever in the path of a woman who wants to have an abortion Remaining Client Cited If you cant represent the State of Illinois what we have before us is exactly nothing Justice Marshall said Mr Horan disagreed citing his remaining clients status as a physician and father Originally Mr Horan represented two physicians and a Methodist minister who intervened in the case to oppose a challenge to the law filed by the American Civil Liberties Union The minister has dropped out of the case and one of the doctors died in a plane crash Mr Horan said today Kathryn Kolbert representing the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists urged the Court to signal clear and unwavering adherence to its abortion precedents and rule the Pennsylvania law unconstitutional She said it would require doctors to give women medically irrelevant information designed not to inform the woman but to persuade her not to have an abortion R Peter Carey an ACLU attorney challenging the Illinois law said it would require doctors to give morally charged and medically irrelevant statements to women seeking contraceptives
"SENATE, ENDING IMPASSE, APPROVES ENVOY TO CHINA",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/06/world/senate-ending-impasse-approves-envoy-to-china.html,The Senate today approved the nomination of Winston Lord as Ambassador to China after President Reagan intervened to end a fiveweek impasse caused by the opposition of Senator Jesse Helms Mr Lord 48 years old a former head of the Council on Foreign Relations and an associate of former Secretary of State Henry A Kissinger was approved by a vote of 87 to 7 The vote was taken after Mr Helms Republican of North Carolina relinquished his hold on the nomination after a conversation with the President Filibuster Was Threatened Mr Helms had bottled up the nomination exercising a traditional Senate prerogative  in an attempt to win assurances from the Administration that it would provide no assistance to current Chinese population control programs Mr Helms indicated he had received the assurances he sought from the President But Mr Helms said he personally would not support Mr Lord He indicated he did not regret his long battle with some members of the Administration and was prepared to take similar action in the future If they think they can wear me down let them try Mr Helms said They are going to continue to have problems as long as they dont give me straight answers Mr Lord was praised as a distinguished nominee by Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York also rose to endorse Mr Lords nomination After the vote Mr Moynihan called Mr Lord to inform him of the result They needed a firstrate man in Peking and theyve got one Mr Moynihan said I called him to tell him it was close but 87 to 7 is not bad Mr Lord is a native of New York City and a graduate of Yale University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy He is a former Foreign Service officer served as a special assistant to Mr Kissinger and was a staff member of the National Security Council in the White House from 1969 to 1973 He is married to the novelist Bette Bao Lord a native of Shanghai The Senate also approved James Spain as Ambassador to Sri Lanka by a voice vote after Mr Helms dropped his opposition to action Mr Helms had blocked Mr Spains nomination until the nominee explained questions he had raised in an article critical of the ambassadorial appointment process Mr Helms told the Senate tonight Mr Spain recognizes now that he overspoke himself when he wrote the article Intent to Delay Denied On the confirmation of Mr Lord Senator Helms told the Senate he had assured the President it was not my intent at any time to unduly delay the nomination and confirmation of Mr Lord He blamed the lawyers at the State Department and the Agency for International Development for prolonging the dispute In a letter to President Reagan Senator Helms had said he wanted assurances from the Administration that the United States would provide no money for population programs involving coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization which he says are practiced in China Chinese Deny Accusations Chinese officials have denied that they engage in such practices The Senators office released a copy of the letter today hours before the Senate began debate on the nomination Mr Helms specifically objected to American assistance for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which supports programs in China In the letter Senator Helms had asked the President to affirm that the Administration would provide money to the United Nations fund only if it pulls out of China completely or if China stops its coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization practices Senator Helms contends that continued assistance for the United Nations group in light of what he said were the Chinese policies would violate recently enacted legislation sponsored by Representative Jack Kemp Republican of New York The legislation forbids use of United States funds for organizations that support or take part in managing programs of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization Funds Are Withheld The Agency for International Development announced earlier this year that it had withheld 10 million from the United Nations population group because of abuses in Chinas family planning program However AID indicated that it could legally support the group next year if China ends the reported abuses or if the United Nations agency limits its assistance in China to contraceptive programs In our opinion contraceptives are one of the best ways to deal with abortion an Administration official said today A senior White House official confirmed tonight that the President called Mr Helms late this afternoon The official said he did not know the substance of the conversation but said he doubted that the President had agreed to any change in Administration policy The President was aware of what Helms had requested and what our position was this morning before the phone call the official said and I dont think there was any change in that position Mr Helms has been sharply critical of the AID position

THE '85 ELECTIONS;   BOND ISSUES DO WELL IN REFERENDUMS AROUND U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/07/us/the-85-elections-bond-issues-do-well-in-referendums-around-us.html,Americans who voted on ballot questions Tuesday seemed unusually receptive to bond issues approving construction of public projects as diverse as a 14 billion water reservoir system in Texas and a 55 million renovation of the State Capitol in Rhode Island The improved climate for bond issues many of which have been defeated on both state and local levels in recent years appeared to be the only clear pattern to emerge from direct voting on issues in nine states and scattered municipalities and counties elsewhere But there were these surprises  Advocates of gun control prevailed in a Chicago suburb adjacent to a highcrime neighborhood  Three New England towns turned down what amounted to an invitation to denounce the Supreme Courts freechoice position on abortion  Antinuclear forces won small victories in Boulder Colo Oberlin Ohio and Maine  Voters in San Diego put unusual restraints on developers of urban sprawl  District of Columbia voters approved tighter rent controls over the opposition of Mayor Marion S Barry Jr  Voters in Tucson Ariz decreed controls on smoking in work places Regulation however did not prevail everywhere Voters in San Francisco rejected a plan to limit the size of skyscrapers Oil companies won a major victory in Santa Barbara Calif where environmentalists lost a bid to put tighter controls on offshore oil drilling And in San Antonio in two Massachusetts towns and one upstate New York town voters turned back efforts to fluoridate drinking water a highly emotional issue of past decades that was revived in local referendums Bond Issues Since 1969 Texas voters have defeated three proposals to improve the water system for expanding urban areas many of them on arid land where the water table has been falling In the past several years however the central and western parts of the state suffered severe droughts causing 68 cities to impose water rationing This year Gov Mark White the majority of Texas business leaders and some though not all environmentalists promoted a 14 billion referendum to build reservoirs treatment plants and other facilities to alleviate what they called a worsening water crisis After a hardfought campaign in which opponents charged the plan would put the state too far in debt the proposal was approved Tuesday by a wide margin The same receptivity to new debt for public facilities was seen in several states including New Jersey and Rhode Island and in urban communities such as Fairfax County Va and Dallas for roads public buildings and other facilities An exception was in St Louis where voters as expected turned down a 155 million school bond issue ordered on the ballot by a Federal judge as part of a voluntary school desegregation plan It received 56 percent of the vote but fell short of the twothirds majority needed Pistols Oak Park Ill a suburb of Chicago is one of the few communities in the United States that has a strong ban against possession of pistols This fall it became a battleground between the national lobbies that are for and against gun control after a local group brought the issue to a public vote In a light turnout voters rejected the groups attempt to override the ban 8031 to 6368 Josh Sugarman spokesman for the National Coalition to Ban Handguns said the vote was proof that victories won by the progun lobby in Washington could not be sustained by a public vote But a spokesman for the local group the Oak Park Freedom Committee said the fight would now be taken to the State Legislature where were going to try to pass a preemption bill that would wipe out all local ordinances and everybody would have to abide by the state law A similar measure failed by one vote in the Illinois Legislature last May Abortion Antiabortion activists in New England contending that a majority of people in many communities were opposed to the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion got the question on the ballots in Bristol Conn and in Dover and Derry NH as purely advisory referendums But the effort failed by a substantial margin in all three communities Nuclear Issue Antinuclear forces in Maine after a long series of defeats prevailed Tuesday on a referendum that will give voters throughout the state the authority to veto any wastedisposal plan they do not approve In Boulder Colo and Oberlin Ohio both college towns voters approved a proposal urging their city governments to keep all nuclear weapons out of the city limits Development Voters in San Diego approved a measure to prevent the city from becoming a place of extensive sprawl such as that seen around Los Angeles The measure passed by a margin of 56 to 44 percent sets aside 15000 acres of land in the northern reaches of the city to be preserved in its rural state until after closein areas have been developed Any change in the plan would have to be approved by voters In San Francisco voters rejected a proposal to ban building permits for highrise structures of more than 50000 square feet a measure intended to control congestion and the obstruction of a view of the bay and other scenery Fluoridation Opposition to fluoridation of water on grounds that it was a health threat seemed to have receded in recent years But on Tuesday voters in San Antonio Westfield and Leominster Mass and Worcester NY defeated referendums to add it to the drinking water after extensive debate In San Antonio the nations largest remaining city without fluoridation the measure was defeated by a narrow margin
"In '88, Who'll Win The Baby Boomers?",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/07/opinion/in-88-wholl-win-the-baby-boomers.html,Senator Gary Hart a likely Democratic Presidential candidate in 1988 has reiterated his opposition to trade protectionism a stance not calculated to improve his strained relationship with labor leaders Representative Jack Kemp a possible Republican candidate has annoyed his New Right allies by speaking out against the South African Government and keeping quiet about abortion and school prayer Is Mr Kemp moving to the left Is Mr Hart throwing away his chances for the nomination It seems more likely that both have studied the demographics of the next election and decided to tailor their appeal The key is the babyboom generation Baby boomers dont fit on the traditional liberalconservative spectrum used since the New Deal Mr Hart attracted them in 1984 by running to the left of Walter F Mondale on cultural and foreign policy issues while seeming to attack his New Deal economics from the right When younger voters gave Mr Hart early primary victories journalists examined this phenomenon A Harris poll found baby boomers more in favor of defense cuts and deregulation and more opposed to protectionism and special help for smokestack industries than older voters They were more inclined to call themselves independents This differing perspective is rooted in the life experience of the baby boom generation Consider a voter who will be 37 in 1988 He doesnt remember the Depression and World War II He was 14 when the bombing of North Vietnam began 18 and trying to avoid the draft when the number of American troops in South Vietnam peaked 23 when President Richard M Nixon resigned and 29 when inflation hit double digits under President Jimmy Carter Vietnam Watergate the cultural revolution of the 1960s stagflation all gave this generation a very different view of government Government didnt solve the great problems of our time it caused them This view pushed baby boomers in a libertarian direction They became committed to civil rights and personal freedoms skeptical of Governments ability to shape the economy and concerned about the arms race and foreign intervention The Democratic pollster Patrick H Caddell says Theyre relatively conservative  antiNew Deal suspicious of big Government as well as big business  but theyre very liberal on social and cultural issues To Mr Kemps press secretary John Buckley The younger generation is prochoice on everything Candidates who have tried to appeal to this constituency have included Democrats Jerry Brown Gary Hart and even Jimmy Carter all more liberal than mainstream Democrats on some cultural and foreign issues and more conservative on economics Republicanindependent John B Anderson who ran for President in 1980 also attracted support from baby boomers But all of them talked also about austerity sacrifice and an era of limits They combined what Mr Kemp calls the painful root canal school of economics with social liberalism not quite the right combination for baby boomers Instead of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism I suggest a different perspective for babyboom voters opportunity and tolerance They want optimism a growthoriented future The GOP needs to combine its fiscally conservative constituency with the baby boomers instead of the social reactionaries creating a forwardlooking rather than backwardlooking coalition Clever Democrats would challenge this approach by moving toward an opportunity oriented economic policy thus trying to add the baby boomers to their traditional peace and civil liberties constituencies Imagine a candidate with the upbeat free market views of say Mr Kemp and the cultural and foreign policy liberalism of Mr Hart and you have a campaign that could attract younger voters into either party and shape the political future for a generation But such a candidate would have to overcome powerful interest groups The future of American politics may be determined by whether the Democrats can liberate themselves from the grip of the AFLCIO before the Republicans break free from the Moral Majority

GROUPS OPPOSE CABINET CHOICE OVER ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/09/us/groups-oppose-cabinet-choice-over-abortions.html,Antiabortion groups and several conservative organizations said today they would oppose the nomination of Dr Otis R Bowen to be Secretary of Health and Human Services asserting he had not been a consistent opponent of abortion In addition Dr Bowen faces scrutiny from Congress because of statements he made recently suggesting that Medicare would save money and elderly people with terminal illnesses would suffer less if they could more easily order a halt to medical efforts to prolong their lives Critics of Dr Bowen said he had in effect advocated steps that could lead to euthanasia Aides to Dr Bowen said he would not respond to the criticism until he testified before the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation hearing probably later this year The committee has jurisdiction over many of the programs of the Department of Health and Human Services Dr Bowens nomination drew a favorable reaction from officials of the American Medical Association the American Hospital Association the Federation of American Hospitals and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee said the nomination would have clear sailing in the Senate Opposition From Conservatives But representatives of 14 groups including the American Life League the Committee to Protect the Family the Moral Majority Christian Voice the Eagle Forum the Conservative Caucus and the ProLife Action League have endorsed a statement opposing Dr Bowens nomination An Administration official said today that Dr Bowen was opposed to abortion on demand but did not oppose abortion in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of a pregnant woman Emily G Tynes a spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League said last night here group was trying to get more information about Dr Bowens attitude toward abortion But she said from what we know we dont consider him prochoice As chairman of a Federal advisory commission that studied the future of Medicare Dr Bowen endorsed proposals designed to allow people with incurable diseases to forgo heroic measures that would only prolong the process of dying He described this and other recommendations of the advisory panel when he testified in April 1984 before the Finance Committee 1972 Letter on Abortion The antiabortion groups are concerned about a letter Dr Bowen wrote to a nurse in South Bend Ind while he was campaigning for Governor in 1972 I am not for opening the abortion law wide open but do believe there may be reasons for loosening it a very little bit he wrote nine months before the Supreme Court in a landmark decision established a constitutional right to abortion In July of this year the Reagan Administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn the decision and make abortion a matter of state law as it was before the Courts ruling in 1973 James L Deger a spokesman for the American Life League said antiabortion groups wanted to know what Dr Bowens views on abortion were now Where does the real Otis Bowen stand he asked Earl Appleby an aide to Senator Jesse Helms a North Carolina Republican said that Mr Helms and other conservative Senators also wanted Dr Bowen to clarify his position But Senator Orrin G Hatch a conservative Republican from Utah who is chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources said Dr Bowen was exceptionally well qualified to head the department Mr Hatch is one of the Senates most outspoken opponents of abortion Other conservatives expressed disappointment with the nomination Richard A Viguerie a fundraiser for many conservative causes described Dr Bowen as a safe cautious centrist pragmatic Republican Mr Viguerie said Dr Bowen will be a good housekeeper but is not the ideal candidate to fulfill the promise of the Reagan revolution Questions on Baby Doe Case When his wife was dying of cancer Dr Bowen gave her a drug dimethyl sulfoxide or DMSO that was not approved for treatment of cancer patients White House officials said they expected his administration of the drug to be a source of controversy But they said they had not expected that his stand on abortion would be a problem The nominee is also likely to be asked about the need to provide food and medical care to severely handicapped infants The treatment of such infants became a subject of national debate after the death of a baby boy in Bloomington Ind in 1982 The boy known in court papers as Baby Doe had been born with Downs syndrome and died after his parents decided not to allow surgery to correct a malformation in his esophagus Grady B Jones of Lafayette Ind chairman of a group called the Remember Baby Doe Committee said Dr Bowen had supported a state Supreme Court judge who had permitted doctors to withdraw lifesustaining treatment from the infant Congress last year passed and President Reagan signed legislation designed to insure that severely handicapped infants receive appropriate medical care

FEMINISTS IN SPAIN STAGE ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/world/feminists-in-spain-stage-abortions.html,Nearly 3000 feminists gathered at a national convention in Barcelona last weekend and voted to do something decisively courageous to protest what they said were inadequacies in Spains new abortion law The next day a group of their leaders announced to the reassembled convention that they had taken two pregnant young women into an adjoining conference room and with medical technicians doing the apparently illegal work aborted both pregnancies Two fetuses were presented in bottles to the convention The hall rocked with cheers and almost all the conventioneers signed confessions of responsibility for the abortions to create a showdown with Spanish justice Some Spaniards have suggested the abortions were a hoax But the police said the abortions appeared to have been real Either way it was only the latest act of defiance in a controversy that has divided Spain since the abortion law went into force in August Law Limits Abortions The law pushed through by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez after two years of debate limits abortions to pregnancies caused by rape when the fetus is malformed or there is a danger to the mother All abortions were illegal before the law went into effect Authorities had projected 25000 abortions in the first year of the law but a spokesman for the Health Ministry said this week that only about 20 had been recorded by early October Working against the law is Spains National Council of Bishops which has declared that anyone who cooperates physically or morally in an abortion is automatically excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church Furthermore pressure from medical superiors and threats of court suits for murder has scared many doctors from performing abortions Four doctors who have performed abortions are already being sued Since one of the four Dr Elisa Sesma herself a 31yearold mother performed an abortion three weeks ago in Pamplona leaflets accusing her of being a legal assassin have been spread around the city The abortion she carried out was of a fetus that Xrays showed to have been deformed The board of Spains National Medical Association forced the Health Ministry to abandon a plan that would have doctors with conscientious objections declare themselves The board advised doctors not to declare their personal views and to refuse each abortion case by case Doctors Fear for Their Careers Doctors in many public and private hospitals around the country have said they are reluctant to perform even one abortion because they have been told by superiors that if they do they will have to perform all the abortions in the hospital The doctors said they feared this would hurt their careers The feminist convention sponsored by a variety of feminist and proabortion groups demanded that doctors in public hospitals be forced to perform abortions The feminisits also demanded unlimited abortion The two preganancies said to have been aborted at the convention were six and seven weeks old and did not meet any of the laws limitations according to convention organizers Some 30 organizers showed the assembly what they said was a videotape of one of the abortions The paraphernalia and bottles with the fetuses were left on a table for all to see The Minister of Justice Fernando Ledesma said at a news conference that the nearly 3000 confessions were meaningless He said only the technicians the accomplices and the two patients could be held responsible

IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/books/in-short-nonfiction-140538.html,GOD SAVE THIS HONORABLE COURT How the Choice of Supreme Court Justices Shapes Our History By Laurence H Tribe Random House 1795 Laurence H Tribe Harvard Law Schools distinguished constitutional scholar mentions William Howard Taft more than Ronald Reagan in this short study of the United States Supreme Court Indeed there are only seven references to President Reagan in the entire text Even so The Senate Save This Honorable Court From Ronald Reagan might have been a more appropriate and more candid title Todays Supreme Court Mr Tribe notes in his prologue is the first ever to have a majority of members over the age of 76 Mr Tribe never comes out and says it but his point is clear President Reagan may remake the Court Mr Tribe does not talk explicitly about the Presidents judicial philosophy or the shape of a possible Reagan court Instead he combs the history of the High Court for a set of interesting but unstartling propositions that seem disconcertingly applicable to the situation at hand A single Justice he notes can affect the Court profoundly The narrow literal interpretation of the Constitution prized by conservatives is largely a myth Most Supreme Court Justices even Earl Warren turn out to be pretty much what their benefactors wanted Selecting Justices on the basis of a single issue  say abortion or school prayer  is unacceptable And perhaps most important the Senate has both a long tradition and constitutionally mandated duty to scrutinize all High Court nominees closely No names are given but we learn that this applies even to popular Presidents elected on platforms of prosperity patriotism and personality in a position to fill several vacancies during their second term The author dedicates his book to Chief Justice John Marshall whose appointment he notes might never have been made had not the Senate first rejected John Rutledge One cant help but think after reading this book that should a seat or two open during the Reagan Presidency Mr Tribe wouldnt mind some repeat performances by the Senate
THE NATION;   AMBASSADOR CONFIRMED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/weekinreview/the-nation-ambassador-confirmed.html,There never had been any doubt that once the Senate got to vote Winston Lord nominated to be Ambassador to China would be confirmed by a whopping margin Mr Lord was finally approved last week but it took a phone call from Ronald Reagan to get Jesse A Helms the North Carolina Republican to allow the yeas and nays Mr Helms yielded only after receiving what he described as Presidential assurances that the Administration would provide no assistance for Chinese population control programs which the Senator said despite Chinese denials include coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization A White House spokesman confirmed that the President had made the call but said he doubted that his boss had agreed to any change in Government policy Mr Lord a former head of the Council on Foreign Relations and an associate of former Secretary of State Henry A Kissinger was approved by a vote of 87 to 7 Mr Helms who was among the opponents blamed the lawyers at the State Department and the Agency for International Development for the dispute which involved American support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities He also said he stood ready to block future nominees If they think they can wear me down let them try he said They are going to continue to have problems as long as they dont give me straight answers
PUTTING A DOCTOR ON THE FEDERAL CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/weekinreview/putting-a-doctor-on-the-federal-case.html,The announcement last week that Otis R Bowen a former Governor of Indiana had been selected to be Secretary of Health and Human Services seemed to symbolize as much as anything the emergence of health care as the preeminent policy issue for a department in which health education and welfare once shared equal billing Dr Bowen a physician displayed a lowkey avuncular style as chairman of a Federal advisory commission that studied Medicare the health insurance program for the elderly in 1982 and 1983 In that role he probably gained a more intimate knowledge of the program than any prior Secretary of Health and Human Services When vacancies occurred at other departments there were obvious candidates Edwin Meese 3d for Attorney General William J Bennett for Secretary of Education But there was no clear frontrunner to succeed Margaret M Heckler the Secretary of Health and Human Services who reluctantly agreed nearly five weeks ago to become Ambassador to Ireland The nomination of Dr Bowen who would be the first physician to head the Department of Health and Human Services was welcomed by the American Medical Association which has long favored the creation of a separate Department of Health But antiabortion groups maintained that he has not been a staunch or consistent opponent of abortion An Administration official said that Dr Bowen was opposed to abortion on demand but did not oppose abortion in cases of rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman At the White House spokesman Larry Speakes speculated that the doctors nomination would not be delayed by questions about his years ago having given his dying first wife a drug that had not been approved for cancer patients Its an old issue thats been discussed many times Mr Speakes said and thats about it Key senators said that barring the unexpected the general practitioner from Bremen Ind was certain to be confirmed He would take office at a time when the Administration and Congress have concluded that there must be broad changes in the Governments system of reimbursing physicians under Medicare Wilbur J Cohen who served as Secretary of Health Education and Welfare in the Johnson Administration said Dr Bowen will be the one to manage the Reagan Administrations costcontrol program for physicians Hell be the one who enforces fee controls Thats the right thing to do  appoint a person who can deal with the doctors Medicare payments for physician services were frozen in October 1984 and the Reagan Administration has asked Congress to extend the freeze through October 1986 The hospital industry which is increasingly regulated by the Government also welcomed the choice of Dr Bowen But ideological conservatives were somewhat disappointed They had hoped that President Reagan would appoint an intellectual who could zealously defend the fairness of Mr Reagans social policies on moral and philosophical grounds Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff evidently preferred a more pragmatic person with administrative experience That experience will come in handy for the Secretary of Health and Human Services runs the Governments largest agency which in the last fiscal year spent 316 billion Mrs Heckler leaves behind a report documenting major disparities in the health of white Americans and members of minority groups If Dr Bowen could find a way to redress the disparities without spending more Federal money he would be hailed by Republicans and Democrats alike Administration officials said last week they wanted to eliminate rules that require public hospitals built with Federal funds to provide specified minimum amounts of free care to poor people The purpose of the proposed change they said was to reduce administrative burdens on public facilities which already provide large amounts of free care but lawyers for poor people and minority groups objected Increasingly health and welfare policy is formulated at the Office of Management and Budget rather than the Department of Health and Human Services As a physician Dr Bowen would have the stature to resist budget cuts if he thought they would adversely affect the quality of health care But as an MD he could also be an effective defender of Presidential proposals to restrict health spending Michael D Bromberg the executive director of the Federation of American Hospitals said There are some people in the Administration who think any Secretary should lie down and die for arbitrary budget cuts We hope Dr Bowen will give just as much attention to the effects of such budget cuts on the quality of care
ELECTION AFTERMATH: G.O.P. KEEPS POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/nyregion/election-aftermath-gop-keeps-power.html,DESPITE close economic ties and an often similar pattern of voting in statewide elections there is an enormous political gap between New York City and Long Island that shows up in local elections politicians assessing last Tuesdays elections agreed While Mayor Koch was leading a Democratic sweep of the city the tables were turned overwhelmingly in favor of Republicans in Nassau and Suffolk Counties Politicians  including winners losers and bystanders  noted that the Democratic failure to crack the solid Republican control of almost all local county and town offices in both counties was particularly noteworthy because the Democrats had mounted strong campaigns for Nassau County Executive and several Suffolk offices including the County Legislature In addition the Democrats in both counties seemed to have volatile issues such as the Long Island Lighting Companys problems going for them In Nassau the Republican political contribution affair was also seen as a major issue And in Suffolk a RepublicanConservative split over the politically important Surrogate post and an aggressive campaign for District Attorney that centered on recent acquittals and charges of police and prosecutorial mishandling of homicide cases had been expected to help the Democratic Party Republicans hold a 32 edge in registration over Democrats in both counties but some Democrats ran surprisingly well including Tony Bullock who won an East End seat in the Suffolk Legislature from a Republican Patrick J Heaney and Robert C Gottlieb who garnered 46 percent of the vote for District Attorney against the winning twoterm incumbent Patrick Henry Republicans swept judicial races defeating among other Democrats Justice Alfred F Samenga of State Supreme Court and Judge Henry J Kalinowski of Nassau County Court  as a result of the Republican abandonment of the tradition of bipartisan endorsement of sitting judges The results reinforced the trend toward an allRepublican bench in the two counties The lopsided Republican victory in the local elections is also pointed up by the fact that Democrats do well in elections for the House of Representatives the State Assembly and statewide posts The Island delegation in Washington is split only 32 in favor of Republicans In the Assembly the Island delegation is divided 147 in favor of the Republicans And in statewide elections Island voters often hold the balance of power between the heavily Republican areas upstate and Democratic New York City One of Tuesdays winners Nassau Comptroller Peter T King noting that local elections involve control of governments that are closest to the voters said the Republicans success demonstrates that people are satisfied with the quality of life here He said that many former city residents who once voted Democratic now vote Republican because they are afraid that the Island particularly Nassau will turn into another New York City Long Island Republicans dont campaign against the city as openly as they once did with slogans like Keep Tammany Hall out of Long Island But the issue even unvoiced is apparently still there several politicians agreed A number of Democrats including a former party leader said privately that the Nassau Democratic Party particularly is still identified ideologically with liberal Democrats in New York City and that that identification is a drawback in Nassau Their argument was supported to some extent by the fact that District Attorney Denis E Dillon had the unprecedented support of all five established political parties from his own Democratic Party to the Right to Life Party yet was criticized by some of his fellow Democrats for his outspoken position against abortion and his participation in the picketing of an abortion clinic Several politicians noted that while Republicans endorsed Mr Dillon in the general election because they believe they cannot defeat him he could be vulnerable in a Democratic primary where liberal Democrats are influential  a threat that has been raised by some Democrats Mr Dillon was one of the few Democratic winners on the Island but despite his local succcess in a Republican bastion he does not consider himself a potential Democratic statewide candidate because of his position on abortion He has acknowledged that he would be even more vulnerable in a statewide Democratic primary Another rare Democratic winner was Bruce Nyman the 32yearold aide to Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer who won the Long Beach Supervisor post He defeated a virtual institution in Long Beach Hannah Komanoff in two Democratic primaries and the general election Mr Nyman will have a countywide forum as a member of the Nassau Board of Supervisors which is composed of the Supervisors of the Towns of Hempstead North Hempstead and Oyster Bay and the Cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach Mr Nyman is likely to succeed his fellow Long Beach Democrat John W Matthews  who was defeated for a second time in his bid to become County Executive  as a prospective candidate for countywide office or the State Legislature On the Republican side politicians agreed Joseph N Mondello solidified his control of the Nassau Republican organization by weathering any fallout from the 1 percent controversy After a trial the Republican Party agreed that Hempstead Town workers had been pressured to contribute the equivalent of 1 percent of their annual salaries to the party and agreed to refund such contributions if requested Mr Mondellos success further eases out of the picture Joseph M Margiotta who had dominated the Nassau Republican organization for many years until he went to prison on Federal charges of mail fraud and extortion Two Republicans who won in landslides  Thomas S Gulotta the Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead and Comptroller King  are now expected to consider statewide races next year possibly following in the footsteps of Mr Gulottas predecessor in Hempstead Alfonse M DAmato who will be seeking reelection to the United States Senate next year Mr King who has something of a statewide following because of his involvement in IrishAmerican affairs said last week that he was interested in the Attorney General nomination but that he would not run without Mr Mondellos approval The county chairman in turn said that he would give Mr Gulotta who reinforced his reputation as the strongest Republican votegetter in the county first crack at a statewide effort Mr Gulotta is mulling it over but he would have little to lose since he was reelected Tuesday to another twoyear term In Suffolk two Republicans who have had stormy relations were the big winners Surrogate Ernest L Signorelli wound up a long campaign with a solid victory despite a RepublicanConservative split and signals that some Republicans were less than enthusiastic about his independence His own party had attempted to defeat him in the Republican primary William M Blake the Suffolk Republican chairman weathered his first major local election as Republicans swept countywide offices and retained control of the County Legislature although by a smaller margin Mr Blake had suffered a setback in the primary when Surrogate Signorelli won The Republican sweep of county offices several politiians said was all the more impressive because of the Democrats apparent success in identifying the Republicans with Lilcos travails and the narrow victory just two years ago of County Executive Peter F Cohalan an election that resulted in the change in the leadership of the Suffolk Republican Party In the countys most important election particularly from a political point of view District Attorney Patrick Henry a Republican won a third term further establishing himself like his counterpart in Nassau Mr Dillon as a career prosecutor Unlike Mr Dillon however Mr Henry had to begin campaigning strenuously in the final two weeks before the election to ward off an agressive Democrat Mr Gottlieb who was making a potentially potent issue of the handling of three homicide cases that resulted in acquittals One came just 10 days before the election An aggressive Democrat as District Attorney could be a serious threat to Republican control of the county The Lilco issue apparently bore some fruit in the County Legislature contests as Democrats narrowed the gap in Republican control by picking up one seat The Republicans will control 10 seats the Democrats eight A Conservative legislator with Republican and Right to Life endorsement Rose Caracappa of Selden could hold the balance of power resulting in tie votes if she sides with the Democrats on some issues One setback for Mr Blake was the Republican failure to defeat Legislator Sondra M Bachety in Mr Blakes hometown Babylon
WOMEN IN WAR SEEK STUDY ON AGENT ORANGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/us/women-in-war-seek-study-on-agent-orange.html,Women who served as civilians in the Vietnam War are pressing for Government recognition that they may have developed health problems because of exposure to Agent Orange A number of the women say they should be included in Government studies of the effects of exposure to Agent Orange a defoliant widely used by American forces in Vietnam They also believe they should be eligible as are many veterans for financial compensation because of health problems they say could stem from their exposure About 10000 American women served as civilians in Vietnam working primarily in recreational programs with the United Service Organizations and the Red Cross Many of these women have found themselves suffering from health complications that experts say are similar to ailments suffered by Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange which contains dioxin Linked to Various Ailments Dioxin one of the most toxic manmade substances has been linked in studies of animals to ailments of the bladder spleen and liver and to spontaneous abortions From 1965 to 1971 the United States sprayed more than 10 million gallons of herbicides including Agent Orange to defoliate areas of Vietnam where enemy troops were active A fund of 180 million was established last year by the manufacturers of Agent Orange to settle a suit brought by Vietnam veterans who said they had been harmed by exposure to the herbicide The settlement which also covered 7000 women who served in the military in Vietnam did not apply to the civilians I would say the area we were in was saturated with defoliant said Joan M Maiman a Red Cross hospital worker in Vietnam in 1970 and 1971 A Form of Virulent Acne We washed in local water she said Sometimes we drank local water We were brushing against plants that had been sprayed We were sitting in the dirt And we know much of it was heavily defoliated Since her return from Asia Miss Maiman says she has suffered from a form of virulent acne that she did not have before going to Vietnam She said she also suffered from numerous allergies and problems with her immune system since her return Many of the women who served as civilians have reported such other ailments as irregular menstrual periods miscarriages cancer of the cervix and birth defects in their children Since these women have not been studied in any systematic manner no one knows whether their illnesses were caused by exposure to Agent Orange They Need to Be Checked Many of the problems they complain about are quite similar to problems of the Vietnam veterans said Dr Ronald A Codario a specialist in internal medicine who was the chief medical witness for the veterans in the 1983 settlement They need to be checked carefully Dr Vernon N Houk director of environmental health at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said the civilians could not be studied There is no central listing anywhere of who was there as civilians he said Wed have to ask for volunteers and that would not be a valid study Last year State Assemblyman Tom Hayden of California sponsored the first legislation directing a state to conduct a program to provide civilians who worked in Vietnam with information regarding herbicide exosure Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California introduced a bill in Congress to conduct a study on the Federal Governments responsibility to the civilians it passed in the Senate but failed to pass in the House The Illinois General Assembly has also passed resolutions calling for medical assistance for civilians exposed to Agent Orange I just think its unconscionable that its taken all these years to determine they just might do something Miss Maiman said We were volunteers you know We didnt have to go
VATICAN SEEMS TO EASE STAND ON NUNS ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/us/vatican-seems-to-ease-stand-on-nuns-on-abortion.html,Officials of the Roman Catholic Church have begun accepting private clarifications from some of the two dozen American nuns who were ordered last year to publicly retract a statement that questioned the churchs stand against abortion A spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said Friday that Vatican officials wanted to settle the matter without gratuitous humiliation to the nuns who had been threatened with expulsion from their orders in the absence of public retractions But an organizer of the original statement Frances Kissling president of Catholics for a Free Choice said the Vatican was merely trying to get out of this quietly and saving face She called the apparent settlement policy regarding the statement which was published last year in an advertisement in The New York Times selective and unjust Second Statement in Works Miss Kissling also said her organization was going ahead with plans to publish a second statement with the signatures of 1000 Catholics supporting the original statements signers and protesting threats against them Those close to the controversy said Vatican officials were surprised at the resistance among Catholics in the United States to the attempt to stop the nuns public dissent and were trying to get the matter settled The original statement was published in October 1984 a time when several American Catholic bishops were criticizing the Democratic VicePresidential nominee Geraldine A Ferraro who is a Roman Catholic for opposing legislation that would ban abortions The 97 signers said recent Popes and the Catholic hierarchy opposed all abortions as morally wrong but they challenged what they called a mistaken belief in American society that this is the only legitimate Catholic position In December the Vatican said it was the signers who were mistaken and it publicly threatened the 24 nuns among the 97 with expulsion from their orders unless they recanted No retractions have been made public since then However Miss Kissling and Russell Shaw public affairs secretary for the bishops conference said in telephone interviews that six nuns had been told by the Vatican that their cases were closed after they made statements to their religious communities The other 18 cases remain open The six nuns whose cases have been settled four in New Jersey one in St Louis and one in Cincinnati have declined to speak publicly about what clarifications they made The Vatican has also remained silent on the clarifications Repair the Scandal As recently as August Cardinal Jean Jerome Hamer prefect of the Vaticans Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes said the nuns would have to repair the scandal created by their public statement by indicating adherence to the teaching of the church This comment was viewed within the church as continuing to demand a public retraction But Mr Shaw said that apparently public as far as the Vatican is concerned is to make it clear within your religious community that you subscribe to the churchs teaching on abortion Mr Shaw who said the bishops were not directly involved in the dispute added Its apparent to me that in the interest of getting this thing settled or at least getting as many as possible settled the Vatican has tried to stake out a kind of minimal response it would regard as satisfactory After first talking of this notion of a retraction he said the Vatican officials found the rhetoric was contributing to the exacerbation of the situation and reacted accordingly Miss Kissling a signer of the statement although not a nun said I dont think theres an attempt on the part of the Vatican to settle this matter justly The just solution to this problem is for the bishops to apologize

VOTERS GO FOR CENTRISTS AND INCUMBENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/weekinreview/voters-go-for-centrists-and-incumbents.html,zNLY two governorships were at stake in last weeks offyear elections but the results in both contests commanded the attention of the two national parties in a dramatic way It was a historic Election Day in Virginia where voters chose a centrist Democratic ticket that included a black L Douglas Wilder as Lieutenant Governor and a woman Mary Sue Terry as Attorney General In New Jersey where Democrats have often held the political upper hand Republicans scored an impressive breakthrough that rejuvenated party moderates Gov Thomas H Kean a Republican won a majority in nearly every voting group including blacks and union members and his runaway reelection helped his party regain control of the State Assembly The triumphs of centrism and incumbency over party labels and ideology sent a message not likely to be lost on state and Congressional candidates in 1986 In Virginia where the Republican candidates had tried to cast the election along national party lines GOP moderates offered a harsh assessment of their partys campaign One of the more outspoken among them former Gov Linwood Holton said What was missing from the Republicans was the middle adding that his partys candidates endorsed by the Rev Jerry Falwell and other prominent conservatives had used rightwing issues that scared the middle away Mr Holton and other centrists urged their party to turn away from the oldguard conservatives who had chosen this years ticket Washington political analysts predicted that the results in Virginia and New Jersey would also strengthen moderate voices in the two major national parties Governor Kean said he would use his victory to impress upon the Republican Party the need to reach out to minority voters On the Democratic side there was the increased visibility of Gov Charles S Robb whose fiscal conservatism and progressive social policies such as the high number of black women appointed to state office were the reference point for the campaign of his successor Governorelect Gerald L Baliles Representative Tony Coelho of California chairman of the House Democratic reelection committee said Tuesdays result had transformed Mr Robb who under state law could not seek reelection into a national party spokesman and possibly a national candidate in 1988 Mr Robb was among the elected officials who founded the Democratic Leadership Council in an attempt to steer the national party toward the political center On Wednesday President Reagan marked the first anniversary of his own reelection landslide by assuring Republicans that they hold a lead on the years ahead But some party officials reflecting on last weeks results have begun to question some of the assumptions they drew from the Presidents sweeping 1984 victory Virginia dramatically demonstrated that there is a limit to the political realignment the Republicans had hoped would win them state and local offices in the South But New Jersey showed the potential for Republicans to broaden their base in the Northeast Dozens of city elections also underscored the advantages of incumbency Most bigcity mayors including Edward I Koch of New York won reelection The major exception was in Miami where Mayor Maurice Ferre was defeated in an election that saw the citys large CubanAmerican population assert its political power Mr Ferre a Puerto Rican was squeezed out of a runoff election this week that will choose between Raul Masvidal and Xavier Suarez both born in Cuba For 12 years Mr Ferre had held the office by mastering coalition politics in a ethnically divided city His winning coalition lost a key bloc of voters this year as blacks abandoned him because of his role in ousting a black city manager In Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire easily survived a challenge by former Mayor Louie Welch who had tried to make homosexuality and AIDS a political issue In the final weeks of the campaign Mr Welch stressed Mrs Whitmires support of job rights for homosexuals and referred frequently to AIDS Mr Welch lost but other antihomosexual candidates running as members of a Straight Slate forced two Houston City Council members into runoff elections The undercurrents of political centrism were also reflected in the way voters across the country decided ballot propositions They were more receptive to bond issues and new regulations on smoking and urban development than to the agendas of singleissue groups In Oak Park Ill voters rejected an attempt to override the citys ban on the possession of handguns and three New England towns turned down a chance to denounce the United States Supreme Courts freechoice position on abortion
CONGRESS;HELMS PUTS IN ACTIVE WEEK ON HIS FOREIGN POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/us/congress-helms-puts-in-active-week-on-his-foreign-policy.html,Jesse Helms might be the only Senator with his own foreign policy On two occasions last week the North Carolina Republican was making headlines by hindering and harassing the Reagan Administrations decisionmaking process On Tuesday the Senate finally confirmed Winston Lord as Ambassador to China but only after Mr Helms had blocked the nomination for months On Thursday Mr Helms persuaded the Agriculture Committee which he heads to issue a subpoena for Miroslav Medved the young Ukrainian sailor on a Soviet grain ship who twice jumped into the Mississippi As a result the Senator forced the Administration to rethink its position on a case that it had firmly declared closed The Senator forced the Administration in to a flurry of indecision before the Soviet vessel was allowed to sail on Saturday Mr Helms then denounced the State Department and advisers to President Reagan carefully excluding Mr Reagan himself The Irritation Was Clear Undisguised irritation with Mr Helms was evoked in the White House and on Capitol Hill on both the ambassador and the Soviet seaman Senator Mark Andrews a North Dakota Republican on the Agriculture Committee who voted against issuing the subpoena said As far as Im concerned there is only one President at a time and Im picking Ronald Reagan over Jesse Helms But Mr Helms seemed unperturbed and that indifference reflects the way he has defined his role in the Senate He is seldom interested in the good will of his colleagues or in the legislative achievements that require the patient forging of coalitions and compromises In fact as he acknowledged recently on the Senate floor he lost control of the Agriculture Committee as it drafted a new farm bill earlier this year As a result he found himself in the regrettable position of voting against the legislation when it emerged from his own committee Instead Mr Helms is mainly interested in using the Senate as a platform to expound his hardedged and strongly held conservative philosophy And he has become a master at using the rules of the Senate and its hallowed tradition of unfettered debate to focus attention on his agenda He Held Up Adjournment At times Mr Helmss use of the rules has caused his colleagues to turn on him in fury In December 1982 he held up adjournment of the Congress by leading a filibuster against the bill to increase the gasoline tax and Senator Alan K Simpson a Wyoming Republican denounced him as giving an obdurate obnoxious performance Partly as a result of Mr Helmss tactics senators have talked frequently in recent years about the need to reform Senate rules and to make the institution function more smoothly But change has never come primarily because too many Senators want to protect their own right to be obdurate and obnoxious when they feel deeply about an issue In the early years of the Reagan Administration Mr Helms focused much of his attention on the social issues such as abortion and official prayer in the public schools He has successfully eliminated most instances where public funds can finance the termination of a pregnancy But he has failed on his major quest overturning the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion Weicker Challenges Him Last week he was again manning the barricades on the question proposing an amendment that would bar the District of Columbia from using its own funds to finance abortions The amendment was defeated after Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr a Connecticut Republican said of Senator Helms Fortunately for the nation what he considers to be a crime is no more relevant than what the Senator from Connecticut deems to be a crime Many legislators say Mr Helms uses the social issues primarily to raise money through his highly sophisticated direct mail appeals and to cause political problems for his foes Last summer he made a desultory effort in favor of a proposal to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction in school prayer cases The bill lost badly but afterward Mr Helms said he had accomplished his purpose by providing conservatives with a list of lawmakers who oppose school prayer In terms of political strategy Mr Helms differs sharply with a group of conservative Republicans in the House who maintain that their party cannot become a dominant political force until it attracts a reasonable share of the black vote Accordingly these House members supported legislation imposing economic sanctions on South Africa and creating a national holiday honoring Dr Martin Luther King Jr He Favors Polarized Parties Mr Helms bitterly opposed both and argued that the Republicans would never get a significant black vote Instead he appeals primarily for white votes and believes that the Republicans benefit when the electorate is polarized along racial lines The North Carolinian has a long interest in foreign policy and he had the seniority to become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee at the start of the current Congress He openly coveted the job but during his heated reelection campaign Mr Helms promised to take the agriculture committee to protect the interests of tobacco and peanut farmers That has not stopped him from exerting considerable pressure on the State Department one of his favorite targets Earlier this year Senator Helms put a hold on several dozen diplomatic appointments a Congressional custom that allows one Senator to block floor action for a period of time He did not allow the appointments to go forward until he received assurances from the Administration that it would find jobs for six diplomats that Mr Helms said shared his conservative views He Warns Them All Mr Helms ostensibly blocked the nomination of Mr Lord in a dispute involving American financing of a family planning program in China But he also took the occasion to denounce the foreign policy establishment a shadowy cabal that he feels is undermining Mr Reagans conservative principles Moreover the Senator was highly exercised at news coverage of the Lord affair and told the Senate But I have news for Mr Lord and I have news for the major news media I am beyond your reach Last weeks events raised the question of whether Mr Helms is also beyond the reach of the Administration and the Senate itself
Letter: On Family Planning;A Move to Undercut Women's Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/opinion/l-letter-on-family-planning-a-move-to-undercut-women-s-rights-066176.html,To the Editor Bad Counseling for Poor Women editorial Oct 31 rightly points out the wrongheadedness and inequity of the KempHatch proposal which would deny Federal Title X funds to familyplanning clinics providing abortion counseling or referrals Women who depend on Title Xfunded clinics for birthcontrol counseling have as much right to be told about their full range of options as more affluent women who can afford private doctors The proposed amendment however is not only disastrous from a publichealth perspective it offends the Constitution as well The first part of the amendment proposed by Representative Jack Kemp and Senator Orrin Hatch which provides that familyplanning monies cannot be used for abortion counseling or referrals violates the First Amendments guarantee of free speech The Government having decided to fund speech in the familyplanning area cannot discriminate between the expression of ideas it likes and those it doesnt like especially when the disfavored ideas concern the exercise of constitutionally protected rights Moreover this attempt to deprive women of information that they need to make fully informed conscientious decisions about contraception violates their fundamental privacy rights The second half of the KempHatch proposal denies familyplanning monies to clinics that counsel or refer for abortion even if those activities are carried out with nonTitle X funds A more blatantly unconstitutional condition would be hard to envision The Supreme Court has held that the Government cannot require a prospective recipient of public funds to agree to forgo its constitutionally protected rights as a condition of receiving the funds Proponents of KempHatch are trying to paint the amendment as an antiabortion measure in the hope of deflecting attention from its obvious constitutional defects But Title Xfunded clinics are already prohibited from performing abortions This proposal forbidding speech about abortion would make it impossible for clinics to provide reproductive health care in a responsible and ethical manner Thus KempHatch must be recognized for what it is  an attempt to undermine the entire concept of Federal support for family planningSUZANNE M LYNN New York Nov 1 1985 The writer is staff counsel to the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation
Hostages to U.S. Abortion Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/opinion/hostages-to-us-abortion-politics.html,Senator Jesse Helms who had opposed the nomination of Winston Lord as ambassador to China because he felt that Mr Lord had not taken a sufficiently vigorous stand against Chinas birth control policies finally agreed to let the nomination go through Even so United States assistance to third world countries that desperately need help in controlling their birth rates remains hostage to people like Mr Helms who insist on playing abortion politics here at home   The outlook moreover is that our programs to control the population explosion will continue to languish together with our prestige and influence in the underdeveloped world until the people in Washington with the power to do so  that includes the President  stand up and say enough What Mr Reagan must understand is that this is not a fight over abortion At stake is the peace and stability of the third world  and inevitably our world too   Its irrational on the face of it to pursue politicsasusual while the population bomb ticks away Yet that is precisely what happened a few months ago when the Administration reneged on a promise to give a final installment of 10 million this year to the United Nations Fund For Population Activities the largest and most important multilateral organization working in the population field   The Administrations reason was that China where the Fund carries out work was engaging in coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization  charges that China denies   The 10 million of course is relatively insignificant Much more important is what happens to the 250 million to 300 million earmarked for all international familyplanning assistance programs for fiscal 1986 and 1987 If the prolife lobby controls the disbursement of these funds the programs will inevitably give increased priority to socalled natural methods of birth control  that is methods that do not involve the any artificial deterrent including contraceptives And that in turn will dilute effective familyplanning support from us to the developing countries in which most of todays population growth is to be found   Nor will the problems associated with population growth be solved if allow ourselves to be wholly preoccupied with charges that China is practicing coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization By the year 2000 there will be a global population of 62 billion four billion of whom will have arrived in this century alone Although the United Nations Fund was cleared by the Agency for International Development of any involvement in these practices the AID Administrator M Peter McPherson ruled that the Chinese connection was enough to disqualify it   In this he was echoing Mr Helms and Representative Jack Kemp Republican of New York who led the successful legislative maneuver that in effect left the Funds fate up to the President The President in turn left the matter up to Mr McPherson   Of course we have a right to make certain our funding is used in ways we find compatible with our beliefs Of course we have the right to seek the truth about how it is used in China But the Fund works in about 140 other countries as well And we have convicted it not of any direct involvement in Chinas practices but purely and simply of guilt by association   That also convicts the hungry and homeless elsewhere Abortion is not necessarily the best answer for any of their heartaches Indeed the most certain way to reduce the number of women seeking abortions anywhere in the world is through truly informative effective programs of family planning precisely the programs for which the Fund has won recognition and praise   The legality of AIDs decision to withhold our promised grant is now being tested in court Whatever the outcome its clear that abortion politics has crossed the border from domestic to international affairs   Controlling abortion politics at this point will not be easy particularly in view of President Reagans own views on the subject But abortion whether in the United States or in China or anywhere else is not the issue here Assuring a better life for the unborn of the future is
LEADER OF BISHOPS' CONFERENCE DEFENDS ACTIVISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/12/us/leader-of-bishops-conference-defends-activism.html,The leader of Americas Roman Catholic bishops today defended the bishops activism and called on the coming world synod of bishops to strengthen the role of national bodies like his The address by Bishop James W Malone of Youngstown Ohio president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops reflects a continuing debate within a strongly hierarchical church about the autonomy and authority of the bishops conferences The American bishops who are holding their annual meeting here this week have taken several dramatic steps including issuing a pastoral letter challenging the military policies of the Reagan Administration But important Vatican officials like Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger have raised questions about the authority that national bishops conferences should hold The conferences were a product of the landmark reforms wrought by the Second Vatican Council The extraordinary synod of bishops that will meet in Rome Nov 24 through Dec 8 will reexamine some of those reforms Bishop Malones speech seemed designed to stake out a strong American position should the synod take up the issue of church governance Expectations for Synod I find dismaying the voices which speak of the synod with apprehension the generally softspoken bishop said in his presidential address opening the American bishops meeting I see the synod as an opportunity to enhance broaden and deepen the process of faithful implementation of Vatican II Specifically he said the role charted by the Second Vatican Council for national bishops groups should be reinfoirced and developed He suggested that the synod should voice its support for the teaching authority of the conferences and for their ability to collaborate with other conferences on important policy statements On social issues he continued the synod should add its voice to the leadership we have received from the Council and the popes on social questions The world needs to know and our own country needs to hear that what we have begun on social questions  from the option for the poor to the advocacy of peace  will continue The debate centers on the interpretation of the Second Vatican Councils espousal of collegiality a sharing of responsibility for the welfare of the world church between the Pope and the bishops In the activism that flowed out of the Second Vatican Council many national bishops conferences have forcefully asserted a strong role for themselves that has occasionally antagonized some officials in the Vatican the central bureaucracy of the church Question of Influence Cardinal Ratzinger is prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith the theological watchdog of the Vatican According to officials in the American bishops conference he has asserted that the doctrines of the church recognize only the authority of teachings from the Pope and individual bishops as leaders of their dioceses and that the authority of groups of bishops is more ambiguous He has argued that a small group of activist bishops in any conference or an aggressive staff can often exert influence far beyond their numbers In an interview Bishop Malone said he does not agree with what he said was the kind of pessimism Cardinal Ratzinger expresses about the work of bishops conferences Im adopting the optimistic tone that were proceeding in a fundamentally sound fashion he said of his conference The American church has taken forceful stands opposing the nuclear arms race and violations of human rights in Central America and South Africa To be bishops in the United States requires us to weigh the moral implications of foreign polcy issues precisely because of our countrys power and far flung influence Bishop Malone said in his speech The bishops are also writing a pastoral letter that calls for major changes in the economy to improve the lot of the poor Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee chairman of the committee drafting the letter pointed out at a news conference that the ambiguity regarding the teaching authority of bishops conferences raises the possibility that the bishops of one nation will come out with one point of view and those of another with a conflicting point of view What does that do to the universal teaching authority of the church he asked Inquiries by Vatican Beyond those specific issues some bishops have been rankled by the manner in which Vatican officials have ordered studies of the nations religious orders Many bishops felt the Vatican had not adequately consulted with the bishops conference before initiating its inquiries and thus not did not adequately recognize its stature In another development here Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago chairman of the Committee for ProLife Activities said that a revised plan for the churchs campaign against abortion would relate abortion to other issues that touch on the dignity of human life Bishops have debated whether such a link would strengthen or dilute the campaign The consistent ethic provides a vision which is essential if the Churchs message is to be seen as a coherent credible agenda in support of human life not merely an assortment of unrelated or even conflicting initiatives he said At the same time he said the consistent ethic acknowledges that each life issue requires its own moral analysis and its own concrete response

When a President Flouts the Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/13/us/when-a-president-flouts-the-law.html,Down through history Presidents have occasionally flouted laws passed by Congress or decrees issued by courts They have tended to be highly selective on such matters however usually reserving headon action for issues of great moment typically those involving national security Abraham Lincoln for example suspended the writ of habeas corpus and ordered the kidnapping of legislators and news reporters in the Civil War and Andrew Jackson told Chief Justice John Marshall to enforce his own decision in a case involving the Governments relocation of the Cherokee nation Harry S Truman John F Kennedy Lyndon B Johnson and Richard M Nixon flouted the Constitution by sending troops into combat without benefit of a Congressional declaration of war Congressional critics say some Reagan Administration officials have ignored the laws and courts on issues great and small from those involving war and peace to those dealing with regulation of infant formulas A number of legislators Democrat and Republican alike say former Presidents tended to give Congress the benefit of the doubt on legislation whose constitutionality they have questioned and enforced the law pending a judicial determination But the legislators contend that Reagan Administration officials frequently have refused to enforce such laws until and sometimes long after the courts have ordered them to do so Rising Tension on Capitol Hill It is a measure of the rising tension on Capitol Hill over such actions that Democrats and Republicans on two House committees recently assailed Administration officials and the White House budget office for what they considered unlawful actions Further the Senate Judiciary Com mittee refused to promote William Bradford Reynolds at the Justice Department with some committee members saying that as chief of the departments civil rights division he had failed to enforce the civil rights laws Even as conservative a Senator as Jesse Helms of North Carolina has accused the Administration of flouting the law in this case an amendment barring United States funds to any organization that supports coercive abortions or sterilizations Senators also closely questioned James C Miller 3d the new director of the Office of Management and Budget on what they considered the agencys unauthorized role as regulatory overseer Michael Johnson an aide to Representative Robert H Michel of Illnois the House Republican leader said there was widespread bipartisan resentment toward what is considered the Administrations highhanded attitude toward Congress Bobs big complaint is that the Administration doesnt understand the sensitivities of the legislative branch he said Dale Tate an aide to Senator Robert Dole of Kansas the Senate Republican leader said Mr Dole had stressed the need for the Administration to listen a little better to what is being said and done  in Congress Representative Jim Wright the Texas Democrat who is the House majority leader said the other day Ronald Reagan has fashioned a regal Presidency like the divine right of kings He considers himself beyond and unanswerable to the laws passed by the legislative branch Administration officials acknowledge that they are frequently perceived as flouting Congress and the courts But they say they are preserving the executive branch from unwarranted encroachments by the other branches of government As legal justification for action or inaction they cite constitutional prerogatives the need for swift executive branch movement on various matters and ambiguity in laws the President must enforce with some of the ambiguity they say deliberately written into legislation by a tentative Congress We Seek to Resolve Conflicts There are times when the Administration has been accused of ignoring the law Fred F Fielding counsel to the President acknowledged But remember that the President is sworn to uphold both the Constitution and the laws We seek to resolve the conflicts Strong Presidents especially are mindful of their responsibility to those who come after them and seek to assure that they do not erode any executive prerogative Congressional critics contend specifically that Administration officials have failed to enforce laws intended to protect civil rights the environment and public health and safety They say the Administration has defied the reporting requirements of the War Powers Resolution ignored a Congressional ban on aid to the Nicaraguan rebels ignored Federal court decisions on Socal Security disability benefits designated the Office of Management and Budget as regulatory overseer without benefit of Congressional authority and declined to fully enforce a law on contract review Underscoring the bipartisan nature of some of the criticism Senate Democrats and Republicans joined in the criticism of both Mr Reynolds and Mr Miller Senator Arlen Specter a Pennsylvania Republican said for example that the Administrations civil rights policies were directly at variance with established law because Mr Reynolds had attacked affirmative action programs that give preference to women blacks and other minority groups Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr a Republican from Maryland added It is now clear that Mr Reynolds does not support the approach that Congress for the past 20 years has taken to the problem of assuring civil rights Similarly Republicans and Democrats on the House Government Operations committee contended in a report last summer that the Administrations selective enforcement of the new contract review law was unconstitutional It is regrettable that our nations chief executive and law officers have to be so forcefully reminded of their constitutional obligations Representative Jack Brooks the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the panel said after a Federal district judge directed the Administration to enforce the entire law Just last month a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said the Office of Management and Budget had been engaged in an unlawful abuse of power in obstructing proposed rules for the Environmental Protection Agency that would ban some asbestos products The issue of Presidential disregard of Congress and the courts is almost as old as the Republic On great occasions Thomas Jefferson wrote at one point every good officer must be ready to risk himself in going beyond the strict line of the law when the public preservation requires it his motives will be his justification Jefferson thus explained purchasing munitions with unappropriated funds after the British had attacked the United States frigate Chesapeake But Congressional critics of the Reagan Administration say it has ignored the law routinely not merely on great occasions Theyre certainly not faithfully executing the laws in my view said Alan Morrison a liberal public interest lawyer who successfully argued the case in which the Supreme Court held the legislative veto unconstitutional Theyre lawstretchers not lawviolators he continued Theyre clever enough to cover their violations with something that purports to be reason under the statute Michael Horowitz counsel to the director of budget office counters that when the Administration publicly challenges legislation or court decisions there are major constitutional issues involved He said noncompliance was intended to lay the groundwork for court tests Other Administration officials say laws are often intentionally ambiguous giving a President wide lattitude in interpretation They say for example that the definition of hostilities that brings into action the War Powers Resolution is intentionally murky as are Congressional mandates to agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration which is charged simply with assuring a safe workplace for every American Enforcement is thus a matter of judgment they say Semantic Distinctions In this same vein officials sometimes rely upon semantic distinctions to justify circumventing Congress Just as Truman referred to the Korean War as a police action that did not require a Congressional declaration of war so the Reagan Administration initially said that its assistance to the Nicargauan rebels was part of a strategy of interdicting supply lines to Salvadoran rebels and thus did not violate a ban on arms aid to the rebels Critics say the tone of disregard of laws and courts was set in the opening days of the Reagan Presidency when Administration officials delayed implementation of all pending regulations The regulations authorized by Congress were finally issued sometimes years later in what critics considered a diluted state They absolutely refused to enforce the law said Senator Albert Gore the Tennessee Democrat who as a House member had sponsored the Infant Formula Act of 1980 The legislation intended to require certain levels of nutrients in infant formula was in response to reports that a lack of such nutrients had caused brain damage in thousands of babies The Administration delayed the issuance of the regulations for 18 months Critics say such flouting continues to this day saying for example that the Administration has delayed for three years responding to a Congressional mandate on guidelines for the handling of radioactive materials

BISHOPS LINK ABORTION FIGHT TO EFFORTS OVER OTHER ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/15/us/bishops-link-abortion-fight-to-efforts-over-other-issues.html,The nations Roman Catholic bishops today approved a plan to battle legalized abortion that links that fight to other human rights issues in a consistent ethic of life Among the issues are nuclear disarmament capital punishment poverty euthanasia equal rights and racism The vote culminates a debate over whether linking the campaign against abortion to such causes diluted the effort or strengthened it The debate also presented ethical dilemmas for many fervent opponents of legal abortion who are not enthusiastic about the churchs opposition to capital punishment The plan is still almost entirely concerned with activities the church will undertake to fight abortion a campaign it has waged for more than 10 years But advocates of the consistent ethic theme first sounded by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin chairman of a special antiabortion committee argued that it would lend credibility to the effort The church would no longer be seen as a singleissue church they said Plan Cites Moral Principle With this vision the plan approved today said different issues are linked at the level of moral principle because they involve the intrinsic dignity of human life and our obligation to protect and nurture this great gift But some like Bishop Walter W Curtis of Bridgeport Conn objected to the plans linkage of abortion to other issues We ought not to take our eyes off the ball and abortion is our principal concern he said In other actions John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia chairman of a bishops factfinding committee said an investigation had cleared Catholic Relief Services of allegations of wasteful practices in its famine relief work in Ethiopia He said the committee found that the organization had not always kept pace with the necessary management techniques but over all was using its donations wisely and well moving food as quickly as possible from ports to inland feeding stations The committees report acknowledged the charge that the organization collected small voluntary contributions from some food recipients But the commitee found relief workers with long experience suggest taking such contributions so the recipients may maintain some dignity and not regard themselves as beggars The bishops also appointed a committee to evaluate whether moral acceptance should still be granted to the strategy of deterring nuclear war through a balance of nuclear forces given the continuing arms buildup In a pastoral letter in 1983 the bishops had said they could accept the superpowers policy of keeping nuclear arsenals in balance only as a temporary approach while efforts at disarmament progressed

IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/books/in-short-nonfiction-155451.html,LIFE IN THE BALANCE Exploring the Abortion Controversy By Robert N Wennberg Eerdmans Paper 795 In recent years the abortion battle seems to have come to a painful impasse with good people on both sides feeling passionately and unwilling to yield an inch of ground In this book Robert Wennberg who is both a professor of philosophy at Westmont College in Santa Barbara Calif and an evangelical Protestant scrupulously analyzes the entire range of positions on abortion tracing the ethical implications of each one He reasons that an unqualified belief in the right to live leads to the uncomfortable conclusion that contraception is as seriously wrong as abortion or infanticide In the same way he also demonstrates that the liberal position inevitably implies that infanticide is no more objectionable than abortion or contraception Ultimately he rejects the decisive moment theory which says there is an exact point after which the fetus has a right to live and espouses a gradualist theory that the fetus has a strong right to live from conception  a right that becomes stronger as the fetus develops into an infant and is born However through strong reasoning Mr Wennberg concludes that this right to live does not entitle the fetus to use a womans body against her will Hence he argues abortion although morally wrong should not be criminalized Mr Wennbergs strength  and his great contribution to the abortion debate  is his unflinching insistence on the inevitability of moral uncertainties no matter which position one espouses
HOSPKTALS' MERGER STUDIED BY OTHERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/nyregion/hospktals-merger-studied-by-others.html,THE merger of a Catholic and nonCatholic hospital in Morris County this month got more than passing notice at East Orange General Hospital and the Hospital Center at Orange whose officials are exploring the states recommendation that they consolidate with St Marys Hospital in Orange After more than 10 years of sporadic negotiations 303bed St Clares Hospital in Denville merged with 169bed Riverside Hospital in Boonton to form St ClaresRiverside Medical Center The apostrophe was dropped so it would not look as if one hospital owned the other The two hospitals are now called the Denville and Booton divisions of the medical center This merger will provide a precendent for other hospitals in the state said Robert Fogg a planning specialist in the states Department of Health It is a realistic way to downsize hospitals Before the merger Riversides occupancy rate had fallen to 41 percent In 1983 in an attempt to ease its financial problems it contracted for management services from the Trimark Corporation the holding company that owns St Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston Under the merger agreement Riverside will abide by the healthcare principles of the Catholic Church This means it will not provide abortions voluntary sterilizations or familyplanning services It took 18 long months of meetings and a lot of blood sweat and tears to accomplish this merger said William Huber vice president for marketing at the medical center There were many emotional issues involved The Catholic philosophy was always the major issue standing in the way of agreement A newly created holding company the SSM Health Care Corporation owns the medical center The initials stand for the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother the order of nuns that owned St Clares The boards of trustees of the two hospitals merged into a joint governing board headed by Sister Urban formerly chairman of the board at St Clares The two hospitals combined bed count was cut by 71 mainly by eliminating some threebed rooms at Riverside and closing its underutilized obstetric and pediatric units Despite protests from a local rescue squad Riversides emergency room has been closed and a new expanded emergency service opened at St Clares A Mobile Intensive Care Unit remains at the Boonton division Most of the acutecare services including pediatrics maternity and medicalsurgical units have been consolidated at St Clares as have child and adult psychiatry The division also has a 12bed center for patients with eating disorders The Booton division retains 30 medicalsurgical beds which will be devoted to cancer patients and 17 longterm care beds for patients who need respirators Sixty beds will be used for adult alcoholrehabilitation and adolescent substanceabuse programs and a sameday surgery center will open there next year
CONSOLIDATING HOSPITALS IS A COMPLEX AFFAIR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/nyregion/consolidating-hospitals-is-a-complex-affair.html,DAY and night the kidney dialysis stations at East Orange General Hospital are filled with patients whose lives depend on the bloodcleansing treatment The hospitals inpatient psychiatric unit runs near capacity the emergency room is busy and at times there is a waiting list for the alcohol and chemicaldependency treatment program But the 60yearold main building needs updating and in the medicalsurgical units one of every three beds is empty A mile away the Hospital Center at Orange has empty pediatric maternity and medicalsurgical beds as well as an aging physical plant that in the long run hospital administrators say will be largely unsuitable for housing acutecare services Yet space is in demand in the coronary and intensivecare units and sameday surgery procedures have increased by 26 percent The hospital Oranges biggest employer has 18 outpatient clinics and its emergency room treats almost 90 patients a day At St Marys Hospital just behind the Hospital Center at Orange the pediatric and obstetrical units rarely are more than half full although about 80 percent of the medicalsurgical beds are occupied Much of the facility was built in 1911 and has been modernized The 18 nuns who run the hospital boast of its homelike rooms carpeted hallways and uptodate technology ranging from nuclear medicine to a videotaping system in the chapel The states Department of Health has called for these hospitals to consolidate into one 500bed facility An expanded St Marys now the smallest of the three would be the base for the new entity because in the departments view it has the best facilities East Orange General and the Hospital Center would phase out their existing buildings These recommendations are part of a controversial state plan to streamline the hospital system in Essex County which state analysts predict will have some 2000 extra beds by 1990 The threeway consolidation would eliminate 400 of them Supporters see the states proposal to combine Catholic and nonCatholic hospitals as the kind of bold step that is needed to insure affordable highquality health care for county residents Critics charge that the approach is impractical and shows how far removed state officials are from the realities of the hospital business According to the state plan East Orange General the Hospital Center and St Marys all have physical plant problems that must be addressed and each has declining occupancy rates that already are presenting a serious costefficiency problem East Orange General wants to spend nearly 25 million to expand its ancillary services and to renovate medicalsurgical units The Hospital Center has a 68 million longrange plan that would include rebuilding the hospital two to three miles west of its present site buying a nursing home and setting up ambulatorycare facilities And St Marys has a 15 million plan to improve its operating rooms ancillary departments gift shop lounges and other nonpatientcare areas Although the states Department of Health cannot force hospitals to close or merge it does have jurisdiction over building and renovation projects The department has announced that it will not support any individual modernization plans in the Oranges In a sense we can hold the hospitals hostage Dr J Richard Goldstein the states Commissioner of Health testified at a recent hearing on Essex County hospitals conducted by the State Senates Institutions Health and Welfare Committee Were not saying that there can be no new capital expenditures he said We are saying Lets consolidate and wrap around the most recent facility  Officials of the three hospitals agree in principle with the states plan but are quick to point out the difficulties including that the 79000 residents of East Orange would be left without an acutecare hospital They note that consolidation could take several forms  East Orange General and the Hospital Center could merge and buy out St Marys  The Health Corporation of the Archdiocese of Newark which owns St Marys as well as two Newark hospitals  St Michaels Medical Center and St James Hospital  might buy out the Hospital Center and East Orange General  A parent corporation could be formed with Catholic and nonCatholic divisions With three hospitals within a mile there is some duplication of services in the Oranges said Laurence M Merlis executive vice president of East Orange General A single consolidated facility makes sense but the mechanics are complex East Orange General is ready to explore every conceivable option Mr Merlis stressed that any talk of phasing out East Orange General applied only to the building There will be no loss of identity for East Orange General he said If we close its because we will have moved into a larger building We still have a commitment to provide East Orange with outpatient services Whatever the final plan Mr Merlis believes the first step is for East Orange General and the Hospital Center to consolidate He noted however that the two hospitals had failed to agree during some 15 years of onandoffmerger negotiations Arthur T Dunn president of the Hospital Center thinks such talks will succeed this time He pointed out that each of the hospitals had some services that the other lacked If we could combine and redesign our services he said we could complement each others strengths The second step would be to deal with St Marys A major obstacle to any threeway consolidation will be resolving the Catholic and nonsectarian healthcare philosophies according to both Mr Dunn and Mr Merlis Like all Catholic hospitals St Marys does not permit abortions or voluntary sterilizations nor does it offer familyplanning services These are now provided by the two secular hospitals Mr Dunn said that should St Marys become the umbrella hospital women still could obtain abortions sterilizations and familyplanning counseling as outpatients at other facilities However he stressed that no alternative would exist for those women who gave birth at the consolidated hospital and wanted to be sterilized during their stay there There are other problems as well Mr Dunn said The state plan did not address what building would be needed or how it would be done he said adding that St Marys had only a small emergency room no outpatient clinics and lacked the support services that a large hospital would need You cant just throw everybody together Mr Dunn said Theodore R Jamison president of the Health Corporation of the Archdiocese of Newark called the states plan for the Oranges appealing but questioned whether a single large hospital would be the most costeffective approach Before a decision can be made about the size and configuration of a consolidation he said the hospitals should have better data on the healthcare needs of area residents Asked if the Health Corporation would be willing to give up control of St Marys Mr Jamison replied It is extremely desirable to maintain a Catholic presence in the Oranges But whether the board of directors of the Health Corporation will be emphatic I just dont know The corporation recently assumed management of West Essex Hospital a 94bed osteopathic facility in Montclair In that case West Essex which has no maternity services agreed to abide by the healthcare tenets of the Roman Catholic Church Mr Jamison has met with officials of each of the two other hospitals and said he was ready to discuss the complete range of possibilities These matters mirror the complexity of the human body he said The parameters being discussed are not simplistic
HERITAGE FOUNDATION: SUCCESS IN OBSCURITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/us/heritage-foundation-success-in-obscurity.html,James Gattuso is an obscure 27yearold lawyer who dropped out of a law firm here to get more actively engaged in politics Unable to find a job in Congress his first choice he became an analyst of regulatory issues at the Heritage Foundation Still in his first year at Heritage Mr Gattuso recently found himself hastily preparing a memorandum on antitrust policy that had been requested by Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige who wanted it to help prepare for a Cabinet Council meeting Mikhail Tsypkin is an equally obscure 35yearold emigrant from the Soviet Union who recently completed doctoral work at Harvard and came to Washington looking for a job in one of the citys numerous organizations devoted to policy analysis Heritage was the first to make him an offer They hire people who dont have a name he explained Mr Tsypkin on the job only five months was part of a team that this month issued an unofficial briefing book to advise President Reagan on how to deal firmly with Mikhail S Gorbachev when they meet at the summit The 54page document made public at a wellattended news conference was presented personally to Mr Reagan handdelivered to other key officials and sent to Geneva as well for distribution there by Ambassador Faith Ryan Whittlesey an old friend of Heritage Such immediate circulation of their writing and the impression that their ideas are reaching if not influencing the top echelons of the Reagan Administration are among the rewards of labor enjoyed by the 27 mostly young mostly obscure analysts who study a wide range of military foreign policy economic and domestic issues for Heritage The agressively conservative foundation founded only a dozen years ago has used a blend of political advocacy public relations and jobplacement services to carve a niche for itself in the staid world of Washington policy analysis organizations By most accounts Heritage in the Reagan years has become the most influential of these organizations pushing ahead of the liberal Brookings Institution and the conservative American Enterprise Institute which are both far older and were until recently far better known Two years ago Heritage bought an eightstory office building on Capitol Hill where it now employs 105 people operates on an annual budget of about 10 million and will have raised 35 million when it completes a fundraising drive this year Its income derives mainly from individual foundation and corporate donations If I had to pick the most influential think tank in the present Administration Id pick Heritage said James A Smith a historian at the Twentieth Century Fund in New York City who is preparing a book on the evolution of study groups like Heritage He bases his judgment on the number of people Heritage has helped place in Government positions the expert witnesses it has provided for Congressional hearings and the volume of articles it has generated for newspaper OpEd pages and other outlets But Heritage is not praised unequivocally A recent article in The New Republic a liberal magazine said Heritage was the most important think tank in the nations capital but it attributed part of that influence less to the intellectual quality of Heritages work than to adroit packaging and presenting of ideas that reflect a diverse rightwing agenda and often verge on the crackpot The most controversial Heritage analyst in recent years was probably Eileen M Gardner who once wrote that handicapped people often falsely assume that the lottery of life has penalized them when they have actually summoned their own problems Those thoughts cost her a job in the Education Department and today she is back at Heritage Heritage has reached its prominence by developing a style that differs from other major study groups Brookings and the American Enterprise Institute try to attract superstars who have already established a reputation in government or academic life but Heritage considers itself a farm club that often provides young analysts their very first jobs The typical Heritage analyst officials say is less than 30 years old in his first or second job and earning 18000 to 20000 to start About threefourths are white males and only one a woman is black Many analysts are bright graduate students recommended to Heritage by conservative professors on selected campuses others walk in off the street attracted by Heritages reputation for hiring and promoting the careers of young conservatives Heritage says it has placed a few dozen of its own employees in government jobs in recent years has helped to place more than 250 other conservatives in policymaking jobs over the past 14 months and still has 3000 resumes on file We Scream and Holler Heritage analysts are not expected to develop highly original ideas in major books or articles that will shape scholarly thinking on an issue Rather they are expected to cultivate sources in Congress and the Administration sense what issues are becoming ripe and produce terse position papers that can be used to sway political argument We scream and holler to get them to go out to lunch with people to find out whats going on said Phillip N Truluck executive vice president of Heritage We dont sit around smoking pipes and thinking deep thoughts about what the economy will look like five years from now Everyone here is an advocate said Burton Yale Pines vice president for research We all recognize that we are here to do battle Mr Pines said that Heritage did not require its staff workers to be orthodox on all issues but he said they all tended to be committed conservatives who know what we stand for Heritage describes itself as an advocate of free enterprise capitalism individual liberty limited government and a strong national defense It pays little attention to such social issues as abortion school busing or sanctioned school prayer which consume the energies of many other conservative groups The pace at Heritage is said to be hectic in comparison with other major study groups but several young analysts agreed it was by no means a sweat shop unlike many Congressional staffs daily newspapers and highpressure law firms What distinguishes Heritage from other study groups Heritage officials say is its aggressive marketing of reports The typical Heritage report is sent to 7000 Congressional and Administration officials journalists and major contributors If timeliness is urgent it is delivered by messenger

CONTRASTS EVIDENT IN PARLEY ON SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/19/science/contrasts-evident-in-parley-on-sex.html,IT was interesting but somehow beside the point the research finding that women in some Western countries were denied rights to sexual pleasure In India women are undernourished and uncared for medically compared with men said Dr Grace Hasan director of the Rural India Health Project Without regular rights how can women have sexual rights she asked at the World Sexology Conference here Such contradictions of culture were frequently apparent at the conference earlier this month by the World Association of Sexologists which drew 600 researchers therapists and other experts on sex from 30 nations And in meeting in India for the first time the specialists selected a country that is filled with sexual contradictions The civilization that produced the Kama Sutra perhaps the most famous ancient treatise on erotic pleasure is today marked by what the experts said were repressive and ignorant attitudes toward sex Indian sex specialists whose numbers are small but growing said most Indians believe fertility problems are almost always the womans fault that masturbation leads to impotence that sexual difficulties can be cured by tonics like lizard oil or asparagus root Women have more health and nutrition problems than men and baby girls have a higher death rate than baby boys said Dr Saroy S Jha a Bombay expert on womens health When a male child is born the family celebrates she said The same is not true for a girl child Links to Population Growth The Indian experts at the conference doctors health care officials and social workers offered glimpses into the links between sex education and the drive to curb population growth India has had some success in this regard Its population increases at less than 2 percent a year less than that of many developing countries but still too much in the view of experts here and abroad Dr Jha said failure to try birth control methods was part of a general ignorance among Indian women about their bodies She related the excitement shown by 12 and 13yearold Moslem girls from a Bombay slum who were taken shopping for cloth and thread for a sewing class It was the first freedom they had ever tasted Dr Jha recalled Within a week they were asking about menstruation and pregnancy subjects they knew nothing about Many Indians said it was remarkable that India with its conservative attitudes toward sex and the roles of women had allowed a conference on sex We have had to be extremely careful and avoid areas that are too controversial said Dr Mahinder C Watsa a Bombay gynecologist and consultant with the Family Planning Association of India Organizers discouraged showings of explicit films and photographs and erotic art for women was deemed especially inappropriate An exception was a wellattended display of ancient sculptures and paintings showing acrobatic couplings bestiality orgies lesbianism and phallus worship Also available were organized tours of the famous 1000yearold erotic sculptures at the Hindu temples at Khajuraho a onehour flight from New Delhi Therapies of the Kama Sutra Theres so much sexuality in the past and yet it appears that todays culture is very puritan in a way said Dr June Machover Reinisch director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex Gender and Reproduction in Bloomington Ind Many Indian specialists saw the conference as a chance to show the world that India was a pioneer in sexology Dr Prakash Kothari president of the Indian Association of Sex Educators Counselors and Therapists who is a professor of sexual medicine at GS Medical College in Bombay gave a slide show asserting that the Kama Sutra a collection of Sanskrit aphorisms assembled 1400 years ago prefigured many of the sex therapies recommended by William Masters and Virginia Johnson Dr Kothari noted that the text recommended that newlyweds abstain from sex their first three nights together so they could get to know each other and reduce anxieties The text also placed strong emphasis on verbal communication fantasies and allowing the woman to be aggressive For the Indian masses today the conference was told sex tends to be nasty brutish and short and ignorance and sexual anxiety are rampant Thus the question for many listeners was why things seemed to have changed Some specialists including Dr Kothari blamed successive conquests by invaders from Persia and then the British and Queen Victoria Perhaps more plausibly others said the Kama Sutra and the erotic sculptures at Hindu temples had always been intended for the elite You really cant say these huge old temples were for the common people any more than the common people go to Playboy clubs today said Dr Watsa the Bombay gynecologist Differences With the West Often in the conference it seemed that the delegates from the West and from India were talking past each other Everyone listened politely to two San Diego specialists report on homosexual marriages But a spirited discussion reportedly erupted later in the womens washroom and most of the Indian women were said to view homosexuality as a violation of nature Westerners generally seemed to regard erotic magazines and films as a sign of a healthy sexual attitude But Indian specialists asserted that the sexual content of movies and popular songs caused an increase in rape and attacks and harassment of women by young men in the cities When Dr Frank Sommers a Toronto psychiatrist asserted that societies permitting premarital sex tended to be less violent and aggressive a group of Indian journalists loudly demanded that he explain how that squared with their view that the United States was the greatest menace to world peace today An Australian gynecologist spoke of difficulties treating a woman seeking advice on contraception so that she could have an affair with a man while not telling her lesbian lover Advanced societies have advanced problems said Dr Jha Some of these problems in the West are irrelevant to us At the turn of the century for every 1000 men in India there were 985 women she said Today that figure is 935 proof she said that the condition of women was getting worse India still has dowries and every day there are socalled dowry deaths cases when a married woman is killed by her inlaws for allegedly failing to pay off her dowry Female infanticide is believed to persist in rural areas Medical developments designed to help women have other effects such as the use of amniocentesis to determine the sex of an unborn baby and then have an abortion if the fetus is female I am terribly sorry to say this exists in our country said Dr Jha As a result of presentations like this the

SPAIN 10 YEARS AFTER FRANCO: DEMOCRACY APPEARS ROOTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/19/world/spain-10-years-after-franco-democracy-appears-rooted.html,The old dictator stares out from magazine covers in sidewalk kiosks Television runs scratchy newsreels of his victories and several justpublished books on him are instant sellouts Wednesday will mark the 10th anniversary of the death of Generalissimo Franciso Franco and Spaniards are caught in a revival of interest in the man who ruled them for nearly 40 years Except for a minuscule group of diehards the anniversary evokes historical curiosity but few public emotions Many political experts here say Spain has moved beyond worry about the survival of democracy to a new more subtle stage of synchronizing it of readjusting relations between church and state and among branches of government of readjusting the shape of its military its police and its unions A More Decisive Path Whats happening now is done in lower tones the historian Juan Pablo Fusi said in an interview but its probably more definitive and decisive in the long term than the hotblooded moments Nearly five years have passed since the night in February 1981 when a mustachioed lieutenant colonel and a band of Civil Guardsmen wearing threecornered black hats shocked the world by seizing the Spanish Parliament and holding most of the Government hostage The coup failed and the plotters still sit in jail The Socialists losers of the savage civil war in the 1930s today govern under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez But they have proved to be moderate social democrats supported even by many businessmen Rarely if ever do Spaniards talk now of the militarys opinion on political issues It does not count many Spaniards say a coup seems beyond comprehension In January Spain is scheduled to join most of Europes other democracies in the Common Market a final stamp of approval Sweeping Political Change Much has been made of the social changes in Spain in the last decade from the toplessness at its beaches and the drugs on its streets to the explosion in its arts and the sophistication of its free press The new political stage is less dramatic but Spanish intellectual and political leaders say equally exciting There is an exception nearly 500 people have been killed over the last 17 years in a campaign by ETA terrorists for Basque independence But today ETA is widely considered isolated as almost every party rejects violence The Most Divisive Issue The violence nonetheless underlines how federalism remains the countrys most divisive issue To appease regional yearnings especially among the Basques and Catalans the framers of the Constitution adopted seven years ago divided the country into 17 semiautonomous regions or autonomias Old fears of the nations dissolution have proved unfounded But the autonomias have been financially costly and the lines defining local courts police and taxes are still being drawn Catalonia led by the industrial power of Barcelona is the most developed autonomia with bilingual education and even traffic signs in both Spanish and Catalan But a public outcry that forced the Madrid autonomia recently to drop a proposed 3 percent income tax reflects how many Spaniards still do not identify with the newly created governments Power of Church Wanes Another stillrunning Spanish fight is over relations between church and state Not all churchmen have conceded Bishops in Galicia in northwest Spain issued a statement last week encouraging voters preparing for elections there not to vote Socialist But laws introducing divorce and legalizing abortion reflect waning church power while an education law that went into effect in September imposes some state control over churchrun schools Another loser in the fight over the laws was the judiciary The main conservative opposition party appealed the abortion and education laws to the Constitutional Tribunal the interpreter of the often vague Constitution This prior appeal automatically held up implementation of the laws Frustrated Mr Gonzalez pushed through a law ending prior appeal but this measure was itself appealed A constitutional showdown ended when the tribunal agreed in May to strip itself of its power Many legal scholars fear the way is now open for democratic tyranny by the Socialist majority The majority is implacably doing what it wants said Pablo Lucas Verdu dean of the law department at Complutense University But the critics say they find it heartening that the Gonzalez Government has been moderate in the area the conservatives feared most economic policy Shortly after taking office the Government nationalized the huge Rumasa group of banks and companies charging the conglomerate was about to fall But the Government has since sold off all of the companies Most Spaniards appear proud of their young democracys strength We have become a model for other new democracies Mr Lucas Verdu said
U.S. APPELLATE JUDGE CRITICIZES JUDICIAL ACTIVISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/19/us/us-appellate-judge-criticizes-judicial-activism.html,Judge Robert H Bork of the Federal appeals court here added his longheld views to a growing public debate over constitutional law today arguing that judges have no authority to add new rights to those specified by the framers of the Constitution Judge Bork a leading conservative legal scholar whom President Reagan named to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is often mentioned by Reagan Administration officials as a possible Supreme Court nominee Faithfulness to the original intent of the framers of the Constitution he said is the only legitimate basis for constitutional decision and is essential to prevent courts from invading the proper domain of democratic government The views he expressed in a speech prepared for delivery in San Diego resembled those recently espoused by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d whose views have drawn response from Justices William J Brennan Jr and John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court 20 Years of Commenting But Judge Bork took pains to avoid any appearance that he was seeking to identify his views with those of Mr Meese whom he did not mention or to criticize the Supreme Court directly something that is rarely done by lower court judges I want to stress that I did not come here to enter into political controversy he said in the speech at the University of San Diego Law School This is a subject I have been teaching and writing about for 20 years mostly as a Yale Law School professor He also avoided direct criticism of Justice Brennan the Justice who best embodies the activist approach to constitutional interpretation that both Judge Bork and Mr Meese have previously denounced and who gave a speech of his own today in San Francisco Judge Bork a sharp critic in the past of Supreme Court decisions recognizing a broad constitutional right of privacy that includes the rights to use contraceptives and to have abortions said today that the Constitution does not cover all possible or even all desirable liberties Distinguishing the Intent He added however that courts must not hesitate to protect rights specified in the Constitution against threats unforeseen by the framers such as electronic surveillance Long before Mr Meese made his first major speech on the Constitution July 9 Judge Bork was the nations most prominent exponent of what he calls the need for judges to be constrained by faithfulness to the Constitutions words and the framers intent His views contrast with those of judges such as Justice Brennan and of many law professors who see the Constitution as a broad mandate for judges to recognize rights such as the right to abortion that are not explicitly mentioned in the document Justice Brennan for example repeated his longstanding view today that the courts should strike down all use of the death penalty He said it was a violation of the Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments even though executions were common both before and after the Constitutions adoption In his speech he said that while most of his fellow Justices and fellow citizens did not share his view on this issue the death penalty I hope to embody a community striving for human dignity for all although perhaps not yet arrived Contrasting Opinions Judge Bork and Mr Meese are political conservatives Justice Brennan is a political liberal But Judge Bork said today that criticism ought to focus not upon the congeniality of political results but upon the judges faithfulness to their assigned role Judge Bork noted that some conservative scholars advocated that judges pursue their own brand of activism and strike down governmental regulations of business as violations of a constitutional right to freedom of economic activity Such an approach he said raises the same problem as liberal judicial activism that judges would be enforcing their own moral predilections and recognizing no law other than the will of the judge
CONGRESS;   SOME IN CONGRESS SAY MONEY TALKS TOO MUCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/19/us/congress-some-in-congress-say-money-talks-too-much.html,Money talks on Capitol Hill and many lawmakers do not like what they are hearing Members of Congress from both parties are expressing alarm at how much campaigns cost and at what they have to do to raise money As a result several bills to alter the campaign financing system are starting to move through the legislative process and one of them is scheduled to reach the Senate floor right after the Thanksgiving recess This measure would place a total limit on the contributions any candidate could receive from political action committees or PACs the fundraising groups that amass money from individuals and then contribute the proceeds in the name of some larger interest Senator David L Boren the Oklahoma Democrat who sponsored it concedes that the bill faces an uphill fight but he insists that the desire for changing the current system is growing steadily I think theres a strong feeling that were jeopardizing the integrity of the entire election process Mr Boren said That integrity is now in question members maintain because they spend too much time raising money and pay too much attention to the moneygivers Campaign contributors might not be able to buy a Congressmans vote but they can certainly purchase an hour of his time Something Has to Be Done Almost every member here will tell you that its gotten to a point that can no longer be tolerated added Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr a Maryland Republican who is cosponsor of a bill that would finance Senate campaigns with public funds Something has to be done The people who run PACs generally dislike the Boren bill and consider it unfair unworkable and unrealistic in the words of Bernadette Budde vice president of the Business Industry Political Action Committee one of the more influential groups Weve never believed that PACs are anything improper in the political process Miss Budde asserted If there are some bad actors they should be prosecuted The basic concern of many members is the sheer cost of running for Congress In a recent letter to their colleagues sponsors of the Boren amendment said that the average price of a winning Senate campaign had increased to 29 million from 609000 in just eight years Moreover a rising proportion of this money is coming from PACs representing groups like the insurance industry or the steelworkers union or concerned with special causes like advancing arms control or opposing abortion In 1974 about 600 PACs contributed 125 million to Congressional campaigns Ten years later 4000 committees funnelled more than 100 million into House and Senate races according to Common Cause the public affairs lobby One result of this money explosion is that members have to devote a growing proportion of their time to prospecting for funds Senators facing reelection in 1988 are already filling their campaign coffers and Senator Mathias said that one colleague had started raising money for 1990 Were spending time raising money that we should spend discussing issues maintained Senator Paul Simon an Illinois Democrat To many lawmakers the dominating role of campaign money is eroding the integrity of Congress and its public reputation Senator Gary Hart the Colorado Democrat who refused to accept PAC money in his Presidential campaign last year said recently What the public perceives is quite bluntly bribery Probably the most troubling result to many Congressmen is the way that fundraising affects the decisionmaking process Mr Simon says there is no question that campaign money has an impact on the conduct of legislators and the content of legislation He is particularly concerned that the growth of the PACs means that Congress is responding to the whims of the rich and powerful Fear Factor in Congress The people who contribute he said are not unemployed or handicapped or on welfare  the people who really need help Fred Wertheimer the president of Common Cause says that a fear factor concerning the PACs is growing in Congress and distorting members judgments Its part of the daily psyche around here he said Everybody always asks how the hell are the PACs going to react to this In order to limit this influence the Boren bill would not allow any House candidate to receive more than 100000 from all PACs combined Senate candidates could take between 175000 and 750000 depending on the size of the state In addition the amount a PAC could contribute to any one candidate would drop from 5000 to 3000 the allowable individual donation to a candidate would rise from 1000 to 1500 Critics of this approach argue that since PACs generate contributions from individuals they actually increase the public role in the political process And anything that discourages participation is going in the wrong direction asserted Senator Jake Garn a Utah Republican who opposes the PAC limitation bill Moreover he adds PACs represent all sides of any given issue so they check and balance each others influence And he does not think that any one contribution can affect a legislators vote anyway I dont think people can be bought for 5000 said Senator Garn Let the People Decide The real answer to the campaign financing problem added the Utah Republican is to strengthen laws requiring full disclosure of political contributions Then voters can make an informed judgment about their representatives conduct Why not let the people decide Senator Garn asked As Senator Boren conceded the chances for immediate change in the system are not great Many Congressmen are worried about voting against the PACs and offending a major source of cash The Oklahoma Democrat said that many colleagues have told him please wait dont do it dont put me on the spot Its like getting hooked on a drug Senator Boren said of PAC money Once youre on it its harder to kick the habit But he sees his amendment as a first skirmish in a long struggle As long as Im in the Senate Mr Boren said I will raise this issue again and again and again
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/21/books/books-of-the-times-169933.html,TO call Neil Postman a critic of television would be as inadequate as calling Bishop Tutu a critic of apartheid or Jerry Falwell a critic of abortion In Mr Postmans view the muchcriticized medium is a peril to our society our culture our civilization The theme of his 16th book Amusing Ourselves to Death is that television is bringing us speedily to the condition of the residents of Aldous Huxleys Brave New World who were seduced into happy mindlessness He writes When a population becomes distracted by trivia when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments when serious public conversation becomes a form of babytalk when in short a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act then a nation finds itself at risk culturedeath is a clear possibility Mr Postman a professor of communications arts and sciences at New York University emphasizes that what troubles him is not the widely lamented profusion of junk on television The best things on television are its junk and no one and nothing is seriously threatened by it but the medium itself This offspring of the union of the telegraph and the photograph he maintains is destroying the serious and rational public conversation that was sustained for centuries by the printing press He warns in the tones of Jeremiah that the Age of Exposition is being displaced by the Age of Show Business When Mr Postman contents himself with analyzing televisions treatment of public affairs politics religion and education he makes a sharp guide Tuning in to the talk shows for example he observes how the medium itself discourages reflection When a television show is in process it is very nearly impermissible to say Let me think about that or I dont know or What do you mean when you say    or From what sources does your information come This type of discourse not only slows down the tempo of the show but creates the impression of uncertainty or lack of finish It tends to reveal people in the act of thinking which is as disconcerting and boring on television as it is on a Las Vegas stage His comments on Sesame Street are especially provocative if not entirely persuasive He decries that muchacclaimed program for being an adversary of the classroom because it stands for the proposition that education and entertainment are inseparable He does not go very far into this intriguing issue referring us instead to an earlier book Teaching as a Conserving Activity in which he examined the antagonistic nature of the two curriculums  television and school Fair enough  but do we really now know that Sesame Street encourages children to love school only if school is like Sesame Street  From what sources does that information come Mr Postmans method of discourse is not always up to the standards he champions On the inviting subject of television evangelists for example he makes the unexceptionable if unnecessary observation that what is preached on television is not anything like the Sermon on the Mount Religious programs are filled with good cheer They celebrate affluence Their featured players become celebrities In building his case however he compares todays electronic preachers with those estimable evangelists of a century or two ago Jonathan Edwards and Charles Finney Although he notes in passing that such currentday preachers as Oral Roberts Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson are probably no more ignorant than most earlier evangelicals he does not take account of all that has happened to religion in America quite apart from television since Jonathan Edwards was in the pulpit Similarly after a deserved skewering of the Presidential debates with their attention to image and want of content he offers in contrast the LincolnDouglas debates Its rather like complaining that Harold Robbins is not Henry James Where are the memorable debates in all the pretelevision decades after Lincoln met Douglas Were the politicians of the pretelevision 1920s superior to those of the 1960s or 1970s Is the level of political discourse today really worse than it has generally been Are Americans quite likely the least wellinformed people in the Western world From what sources does that information come Mr Postman goes back to the highly literate population of Revolutionary America to show how we have fallen a strikingly unhistorical tactic His picture of life before the coming of the tube is highly idealized and like many critics of popular culture he seems reluctant to say an unkind word about the mass audience to which television caters Mr Postmans weakness for theorizing may be related to an understandable desire of professors of communications in one incarnation he was Professor of Media Ecology to raise their novel specialty to the level of traditional academic subjects He concludes his book with something of a commercial for his line of work calling on the nation to devote itself to understanding the nature of the beast of television before we are devoured Mr Postman is in an edifying tradition of mediumbashers Theater movies newspapers magazines and radio have all been charged with degrading public taste and morality and portending the barbarians victory over civilization These warnings have not been without merit and as Mr Postman properly keeps reminding us televisions impact is immeasurably more pervasive than anything that has gone before Still the barbarians though always with us have not quite triumphed Amusing Ourselves to Death is best when its author helps us to see what is happening on the screen That picture is gloomy enough without apocalyptic prophecies of culturedeath
BUDGET CONFEREES NARROW DISPUTES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/22/us/budget-conferees-narrow-disputes.html,House and Senate negotiators working on a compromise version of budgetbalancing legislation said this evening that they had narrowed their differences to two key issues But after daylong negotiations they said they would have to wait until after the Thanksgiving recess to try to work them out The main dispute over the legislation seeking a balanced budget by the 1990s is House Democrats insistence on protecting nine programs most of them for the poor from the automatic spending cuts envisioned in the budgetbalancing proposals The House plan would also not let Medicare and Medicaid the health care programs for the elderly and for the poor be cut below current spending levels This evening Senate Republicans who have opposed protecting these programs offered the Democrats a compromise that would exempt seven of the nine programs from the automatic cuts But the two other programs the House wants to protect migrant health and community health would be subject to cuts to below current spending levels as would Medicare and Medicaid Both chambers have generally agreed to limit any automatic spending cut in the military budget to 50 percent of the total But the House has insisted that the social programs be exempted as part of this compromise Discord Over 1986 Cut The other issue separating the House and Senate conferees is how much of a spending cut to require for the current fiscal year 1986 Both the House and Senate versions of the budgetbalancing legislation would set annual deficit ceilings that would force a balanced budget in the 1990s Both would also mandate automatic spending reductions each year to reach the deficit ceiling if the White House and the Congress could not agree on a separate budget plan to reduce the deficit The Senate negotiators were relatively confident the differences could be worked out Im confident were going to reach agreement said Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee But Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus was not as confident When asked if a compromise could be reached he said I dont know Panel Passes Omnibus Bill Meanwhile the House Appropriations Committee today approved an omnibus spending bill for 1986 that would hold military spending to its 1985 level Opposition is expected from the Senate and by the Reagan Administration which want an increase to cover inflation The omnibus bill which also includes provisions aimed at easing the farm credit crisis is being prepared to approve funds for agencies that might lack separate appropriations when Congress recesses in midDecember The panel also approved a ban on the use of Federal funds by agencies that advocate abortion although doctors could discuss the procedure Federal law already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions unless the life of the mother is in danger The panel rejected a proposal offered by Jack F Kemp Republican of upstate New York to prohibit abortion referrals
TRUE VIRTUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/magazine/true-virtue.html,THE LANGUAGE IF MY RECENT EXperience be any guide badly needs a new word The word needed is one to describe those people who are extremely confident about their own virtue and whose spectacular confidence nicely feeds their general feeling of superiority They are superior to me or so they have made plain and they are probably superior to you if only you will give them the opportunity to demonstrate it The people I have in mind have a superiority complex they are completely convinced of their own moral superiority I think of them as virtucrats for they are empowered by the unfaltering sense of their own virtue Roughly a year and a half ago in the midst of the Democratic primaries I went to lunch with an old acquaintance a Chicago journalist It was at an Italian restaurant and both the food and the talk seemed fine All was humming along jollily when the journalist began extolling Gary Hart who at that point in the primaries had begun showing remarkably well Normally I prefer to let sleeping dogmas lie my own and the next persons but I have this thing about Gary Hart In four words  I dislike him intensely I dislike his selfrighteousness his promises to make government compassionate again his general virtuousness so often selfproclaimed and so endlessly implied As my luncheon companion went on and on about what a helluva guy Gary Hart was I felt this sentence gurgling in my throat  a sentence I have used in the mostly liberal circles in which I travel to enliven dull parties and sometimes to end lively ones  and then whoosh it was out I voted for Reagan in 1980 I said and shall probably do so again There you might say went the lunch To the veal limone on the plate before me was now added an ample side order of political bile After I had allowed that I had voted for Ronald Reagan and would probably do so again my lunch companion said he thought Reagan dangerously stupid I requested examples of his stupidity but none was forthcoming He added that the men around Reagan were a terrible and dangerous lot yet here too impressive examples were wanting He brought up Central America I said I thought it worth defending even with its wretched regimes especially since the Communists were willing to go to such lengths to put and sometimes to keep leftist governments in power there He said that we drive these people into the arms of the Communists I said it seemed to me that it doesnt usually turn out to be a very long drive When the salad arrived I went on the offensive I claimed that despite the frequent Laurel and Hardylike antics of the CIA despite the patent interests of American business abroad I thought the humanitarianism of the United States in its dealings with other nations through the supplying of food and money and technical assistance was impressively generous and in fact unsurpassed by any other modern nation I knew He brought up multinational corporations I responded that multinationals didnt quite seem to represent the worst the world had to offer in the way of evil just now As for things at home I asked him how he could be so certain that the success of the Reagan Administration in lowering inflation didnt do more for the poor than a great many welfare programs that seemed to be deadended I asked when would the time come when a black leader or any liberal politician would address himself to the problem of black youth crime which makes life hell in so many black neighborhoods Dessert arrived I gulped mine swept up in the passion of polemic I cannot tell you what it was Here I ought to insert that I have never lost a political argument in my life which is surely an impressive fact though it tends to pale somewhat when I add that neither have I ever won one But that afternoon as we left the restaurant I believed I had scored a point or two Out on the sidewalk as we were about to go for the car my companion agreed that much of what I had said was cogent Of course he added your position is made a lot easier by your not caring about people Let us pause for a moment while I remove the dagger from my back the arrow from my heart the knee from my groin A virtucrat had struck While pausing let us consider what has really been said here I read it to mean that I may be right or I may be wrong in my views but right or wrong I have demonstrated that I do not care about people I have therefore a small heart and a mean spirit which is to say right or wrong I am finally wrong I am wrong above all in not being as good a man as the man who sat across from me at lunch He has virtue I dont  case closed F LIP THE CALENDAR forward to roughly six months ago when I was in my office at the university where I teach talking with a student My telephone rang A young woman whose name I didnt quite catch identified herself as a reporter for the schools daily newspaper Mr Epstein she said I am writing a piece on gay life on campus and I note that you once said that youd rather your sons be murderers or dope addicts than homosexuals Is this true Fifteen years ago in Harpers I had indeeed written a longish essay about homosexuality that had stirred a certain amount of controversy the then nascent Gay Liberation Movement had zapped  as the word then was Harpers offices and I had received hundreds of letters both for and against what I had written I can of course recall my general views in that article  that the origins of homosexuality remain for the most part a mystery that with the exception of a small number of extraordinary people homosexuality has brought much grief to its practitioners  but I could not after 15 years recall all that I had written in that essay I was nonetheless quite certain that I could not have said that I would rather have my sons be murderers or dope addicts than homosexuals and this for a simple reason I believe no such thing nor have I ever believed it Where did you find such a statement I asked She named a textbook a gay liberation reader where she said a gay friend of hers had seen my position thus characterized I am fairly certain that I never said any such thing I said And I would be grateful to you if you didnt print that I did unless you find proof of my having done so I hope you will consider very carefully before you do such a thing Then you dont believe what you are reported as believing No I said of course not Well let me ask you this do you ever attack or demean homosexuals or homosexuality in your classrooms This was a monumentally insulting question but this young woman beginning to sound very comfortable in the virtue of her own position seemed not in the least aware that it was If I did I said I would be a pretty disgraceful teacher wouldnt I As it happens I dont even think a university teacher ought to reveal his politics in the classrooms let alone attack anyone for his sexual disposition Well Ill tell you what she said Im not going to print this story especially since you tell me that you never bring your views on homosexuality into the classroom and never attack anyone because theyre gay Here I felt an unusual mixture of emotions relief combined with rage Meanwhile the stink of virtue seemed to be wafting out of the phone You know Professor Epstein she said truly flying on virtumatic now I happen to be Jewish and when I was little I used to come home from school and complain to my father about the black kids in our school My father corrected me He said that I as a Jew had a special responsibility not to look down upon anyone else I dont know about you professor but I always thought my father was right  and I still think he is The telephone receiver shook in my hand There was nothing for it but to listen to this young woman ablaze now with her own goodness lecturing to me about her enlightened views My student sat passively across the desk from me I must have been red  quite possibly blue  in the face Miss I finally said in exasperation you seem to be mainly telling me about what a fine person you are which is perhaps a sign that we ought to end this conversation But she never heard me so happy was she in her work and she continued to rattle on until I announced that I had a student waiting and must now hang up I N BOTH THESE STORIES SOME of the characteristics of the virtucrat are revealed chief among them his belief in his own moral superiority The virtucrat is certain he has virtue on his side The virtue being laid claim to is public virtue it is the virtue that comes from the certainty that ones own opinions are the only correct opinions The virtucrat is a prig but a prig in the realm of opinion The old priggery was sniffy about private life the prig of former years was contemptuous of the drinker or of the woman who smoked in public or of the promiscuousness of either sex The new prig the virtucrat holds it against you if you dont hold his views on Nicaragua or nuclear power or abortion But the old prig and the new prig are joined in their warm feelings of selfcongratulation and their cold contempt for those with whom they disagree How can the virtucrat be so confident of his virtue Virtue true moral excellence is rare at any time and given to few at all times especially in the public realm In the dialogue bearing his name Platos character Meno asks Socrates if he thinks virtue can be taught to which Socrates replies that he cannot teach it for the sound reason that he is not certain what it is Maimonides struggled with the question of whether the virtuous man is he who does good things in spite of a craving to do bad or he whose natural craving whose whole soul longs to do good But the virtucrat is beyond all this philosophical fiddle He knows where virtue resides  it resides in him He is a modern Diogenes who in search of one good man knocked off after turning his lantern on himself Nor is the virtucrat much troubled by the fact that virtue in public life seems so scarce a phenomenon When one attempts to think of people in the recent modern age who have had it the term short list suddenly becomes vivid Here is mine Mother Teresa Martin Luther King Jr perhaps Lech Walesa In American government the only name I can think of is that of George Marshall Short though my list is there are people who would argue with some of the names on it None of which of course stops vast hordes of people from claiming virtue for themselves As a starter consider our national political parties at last years conventions Their ostensible tasks were to put together platforms and to nominate candidates for election But their real business with the television cameras upon them was to impress upon the nation how each of them was the true repository of goodness  that is to say the standard bearer of political virtue Mario Cuomos keynote address which I thought so brilliant in delivery turns out upon reading to be an invitation to members of the Democratic Party to recall that they comprise the political party that cares that they are and always have been the party that is concerned for the welfare of all that they in short have the lock on virtue The Republican convention with its moral majoritarian ministers scurrying about and its politicians flush with an economic boom was saying essentially the same thing as its rivals though the terms were different  providing opportunity instead of caring  the message was the same virtue rests with us Such claims have always given American politics its comic piquancy and it has kept American politicians the subject of deserved and abiding distrust on the part of the populace they supposedly represent Much virtucratic behavior is unconscious or at least not altogether conscious Sometimes people do not know that the massage behind their message is one of their own egos Thus the morning after last years Presidential election on the CBS Morning News a Mondale supporter in Chicago a woman who appeared stunned by the completeness of Reagans victory when asked her response to the election results replied that she worried that the country isnt good enough Did she know that what she was really saying is that the country isnt as good as she who voted otherwise Possibly not But then an avowedly conservative administration in Washington is a fine spur to virtucratic remarks allowing those who didnt vote for it to come on quite as selfrighteous as a PBS documentary on an endangered species At a National Book Critics Circle panel on the current literary scene for example the literary critic Elizabeth Hardwick announcing that there has been a reversal of liberalization in the country and that she was sure minorities would feel it in literature went on to remark There is a belief now that you dont have to worry about women There is no longer affirmative action of the heart Spoken like a real virtucrat Remarks are not literature Gertrude Stein once supposedly told Ernest Hemingway Neither when they are made without risk or cost of any sort are remarks virtue Its not all that difficult to spot a virtucrat Whatever he may ostensibly be saying what he is really saying is Im fundamentally a damn fine person Understanding this is a great aid in the contemporary world It helps one to understand why so many people espouse opinions that they dont finally believe in merely enunciating those opinions  opinions held to be congruous with goodness makes them feel good Unfortunately one test for virtue is that applied for charm if you think you are charming this test runs you probably arent The same holds for virtue whoever claims it even implies he has it  probably doesnt have it Another more arduous test is that of experience Has ones virtue been tested under fire One may not care for Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns politics or writing  I happen to admire both  but there can be no disputing his moral authority his right to claim though I am not aware that he has ever directly claimed it the heroic virtues of moral and physical courage Similarly no one can speak out against the Nazi death camps with anything like the same authority of those who have in fact survived them One can deplore the death camps an easy enough thing to do one can be pledged never to forget them but unless one can answer positively the old vaudeville comedians question Vas ya dere Sharlie one cannot attain virtue from ones strong feelings about them The famous Scribners editor Maxwell Perkins wrote that One of my deepest convictions is that the terrible harms that are done in this world are not done by deliberately evil people who are not numerous and are soon found out They are done by the Good  by those who are so sure they are good that they are sure that God is with them Nothing can stop them for they are certain they are right Confidence in his own goodness is of course another sign of the virtucrat Our society seems to require a certain number of professional virtucrats columnists editorial writers broadcast commentators I recall a television editorial on the subject of black youth crime I not long ago heard delivered by Bill Moyers who is one of our leading professional virtucrats Mr Moyers raison detre  or as they used to say at the old Stage Delicatessen his shtick  is demonstrating serious moral concern He speaks he is paid to speak for virtue Thus toward the close of his editorial on black youth crime Mr Moyers concluded that no one is facing the issue squarely So it keeps ticking away Dissolve and go to commercial But before we do perhaps it is best to be clear about one thing Someone is facing the issue squarely and that someone is Bill Moyers If the clock runs out and the bomb explodes it sure as hell isnt going to be his fault He has already told us what to do create better education more jobs strengthen the black family a few simple items like that The rest of us less morally sensitive turn away But not to worry We sleep tonight for there is Bill Moyers awake all night sitting there doubtless in the dark facing the issue This may seem unfair to Bill Moyers who is trapped in a hopeless form the editorial the virtucratic genre par excellence which requires a moral refrain line usually sung with a booming chorus of selfcongratulation What is true of editorialists tends also to apply to the majority of newspaper columnists But it need not always apply In his columns Walter Lippmann did not profess to be morally better than the Presidents he so often advised and who so often ignored his advice nor did he assume they were vicious if they did not immediately come round to his view But most contemporary columnists  names on request  seem positively excited by the task of making clear that they know where virtue lies  to speak plainly they know it lies with them A virtucrat is for all international amity but personally refuses to set foot in Germany which he can never forgive for the Nazi Holocaust No nonunion lettuce nor nonunion grapes are permitted to pass his lips he shops with an eye out for avoiding the products of firms connected with the many political causes and events he

lapse and quality slips because of them so be it For him justice is the overwhelming the architectonic the transcendent consideration Yet no single philosophy can hope to encompass his wideranging virtue though the songs of Joan Baez do capture something of the capacious spirit behind it the Joan Baez songs of which VS Naipaul in A Bend in the River wrote You couldnt listen to sweet songs about injustice unless you expected justice and received it much of the time You couldnt sing songs about the end of the world unless    you felt that the world was going on and you were safe in it As a man with a very low reputation for virtue used to like to say let me be perfectly clear about this virtue is a fine a beautiful a wondrous thing But true virtue must always be distinguished from the claims to virtue Among the mysteries of virtue is its way of turning up in unexpected places Anyone who has read Schindlers List Thomas Keneallys book on Oskar Schindler the German industrialist bon vivant and hustler who time after time risked his life to save Jews from the Nazi death camps cannot but wonder whence this mans inexplicable virtue derived But then virtue often comes to the fore in situations of crisis in slavelabor camps in jails in the streets of mean cities If the presence of true virtue seems quite as mysterious as the presence of evil the presence of selfproclaimed virtue is no mystery at all It refreshes the spirit to proclaim ones own high ideals it may be even sweeter merely to imply them What is more it tends to pay off many virtucrats do a brisk business in awards honors and other riches of this earth Orwells sound advice that Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent is not for the most part generally followed in regard to virtucrats Proclaim your own virtue often enough and other people may come to believe it In time you may come to believe it yourself If you cant make a convincing case for being virtuous on your own perhaps you can climb aboard one or another wagon of group virtue When blacks a few years back spoke of having soul they were essentially making a case for their own special streetacquired virtue Jews as a group often do the same thing in other ways The older Protestant upper classes in this country who once relied rather heavily on the notion of class virtue no longer have the nerve openly to claim it Virtue is also available in generations Ask anyone who came of age in the late 1960s or early 70s what it was like to grow up then and he or she will tell you how exhilarating it was What they really mean by exhilarating I believe is how virtuous it felt theirs being the generation as its members like to think themselves that got the nation out of Vietnam broke down its hypocritical middleclass mores and in all represented America in its highest idealism There has always been something slightly sanctimonious something a touch superior about the 60s generation who could even claim smoking pot as an act of serious social significance Theirs was the virtue generation Many leading virtucrats are men and women of the left There are reasons for this The left has always styled itself the side of the heart leaving the right with the liver Those who are on the left have always needed to feel that they are goodhearted Conservatives and those on the right are usually willing to settle for thinking they are obviously correct liberals and those on the left along with thinking themselves correct must also feel they are good For them what they construe to be good is tantamount to being correct Disagree with someone on the right and he is likely to think you obtuse wrong foolish a dope Disagree with someone on the left and he is more likely to think you selfish a sellout insensitive possibly evil Smugness tends to be the reigning sin of the right selfrighteousness that of the left Virtue first showed up as a strong strain on the left in the French Revolution Camus noted the hunger for virtue in SaintJust that virtucrat of the revolution who in the institutions he devised for the new French republic refused to allow children to eat meat until the age of 16 and    dreamed of a nation that was both vegetarian and revolutionary Orwell noted something of this same penchant for virtue on the left of his own day when criticizing his fellow socialists in the second half of The Road to Wigan Pier he wrote One sometimes gets the impression that the mere words Socialism and Communism draw towards them with magnetic force every fruitjuice drinker nudist sandalwearer sexmaniac Quaker Nature Cure quack pacifist and feminist The virtucrats among the Bolsheviks wanted nothing more than for everyone else to be as good as they  and were perfectly ready to kill them if they didnt come up to the mark Some subjects bring out the virtucrat in people more than do others and at the moment it appears to be the subjects in which the left is principally interested that are chief among them Individualism and hatred of government intervention dont quite trip the virtue glands on the right as they once did at least conservatives dont seem to get in anything like the same moral sweat about them that they used to Nowadays those on the right only let the virtue pour out of them on the subject of abortion and perhaps school prayer Their phrase prolife is a piece of virtucratic advertising genius leaving as it does opponents with the position of being antilife But a perfectly matched set of virtucratic opinions today would include being for a clean environment for all art for the demands of all minorities for all the nations of the third world and for being against oppression against hunger against violence against war and above all nuclear war You Cant Hug a Child With Nuclear Arms reads a fine new virtucratic bumper sticker What makes these opinions virtucratic rather than shall we say serious is that first one doesnt have to do much about them after announcing one is for them and that second one has to dig around pretty thoroughly to find people who are really for the things the virtucrat is against Take the most significant item among these opinions war especially nuclear war I should like to have someone tell me who is for nuclear war I should like to be presented with some names Isnt the argument in fact about how best do we avoid nuclear war through what degrees of deterrence negotiation and the rest of it I should have thought there are grounds for serious argument here I dont believe the virtucrat does On all these subjects he imputes bad faith to those whose views arent congruent with his own But one sometimes has to wonder if argument and agreement is really of utmost interest to the virtucrat He requires opposition in the way the old avantgarde required a bourgeoisie in the way snobs require a crude lowermiddle class the virtucrat requires opposition that is in order to define himself He is certain that he himself is largehearted and greatsouled and I sometimes think he may be secretly pleased when the rest of us including his own country fail to meet his own high standards In letting him down we raise him up in his own estimation None of this I hope it is clear is intended to imply in any way that there are no good causes or that morality is hopelessly antiquated in a complicated modern world Neither is so Max Weber makes a penetrating I think a crucial distinction on this point when he notes that there exists an ethics of responsibility and an ethics of conviction The ethics of responsibility requires accepting unpleasant truths the limits of knowledge and of human nature the cost of actions and sometimes the cost of refusing to take actions The ethics of conscience requires reminding humankind of its moral duty to live up to its highest potentiality and restraining it from acting solely out of expedient or base motives Clearly those societies function best in which the practitioners of the ethics of responsibility and those of the ethics of conscience are at least roughly wellmatched In this scheme the virtucrat obviously sees himself as a proponent of the ethics of conviction The problem he presents however is that he is all conviction  virtue pure and unadulterated It was Camus who considering the virtucrats of the French Revolution wrote Pure and unadulterated virtue is homicidal And so in modern history it has proven the more zealous for virtue the revolutionaries of the modern era have been the greater the number of corpses they have piled up The virtucrats I have been writing about here cannot be charged with anything so lethal But what they often do kill is good causes by tying their own easy virtue to them and they badly maim the ideal of morality in public life through the fraudulence of their own shoddy examples Let us then know them as virtucrats and know too that their most serious function lies in helping to make very clear what true virtue isnt

THE POPE'S GUARDIAN OF ORTHODOXY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/magazine/the-pope-s-guardian-of-orthodoxy.html,THIS MORNING SOME 165 BISHOPS and archbishops from around the world are scheduled to gather in St Peters Basilica for a papal mass inaugurating a solemn assembly that could alter the course of Roman Catholic history Shortly before noon Pope John Paul II will stand before Berninis altar and address the prelates Speaking from the marbled high altar the Pontiff will open an Extraordinary Synod of Bishops designed to assess the course the church has taken during the two decades since the Second Vatican Council which itself radically changed the church by opening it to a modern world that Catholicism had long regarded with deep skepticism The Pope is not expected to lay down the law today to this select group box page 42 most of them heads of their national bishops conferences though that may come later He is instead expected to counsel them to pray for the success of their encounter and exhort them to thoughtfulness Near the Pope will be a whitehaired quietspoken West German On the street Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger can seem a shy and selfeffacing man easily mistaken for a visiting parish priest from his native Bavaria Yet he has emerged as the second most powerful man in the Vatican And it is not without cause that many have dubbed this meeting Ratzingers Synod Joseph Ratzinger prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is not a household name  yet But no man other than the Pope himself has seen his name figure so prominently in the discussions and debates during the months leading up to the Synod And no one including the Pope has come under such bitter attack over what many see as an attempt to roll back the changes wrought by and after Vatican II It is perhaps a sign of just how much the Roman Catholic Church has changed since Vatican II that Cardinal Ratzinger has become the center of attention not only because of his job as the guardian and promoter of Catholic orthodoxy but also for an interview with an Italian journalist first published in Jesus a Catholic magazine In astonishingly clear language unencumbered by diplomatic hedges the Cardinal declared the postConciliar years as decidedly unfavorable for the Catholic Church Public statements to reporters are not the way the mysterious old Roman Curia used to work its will Yet merely by agreeing to a reporters request for a long interview Cardinal Ratzinger became nearly everyones reference point To be for or against Cardinal Ratzinger  that among many Catholics is the question And that question is important for this Synod because Cardinal Ratzinger believes Vatican II has been distorted and misused by those who are called progressives The progressives in turn have fought back fiercely with a flurry of articles statements and denunciations THE FIGHT OVER THE SYNOD  IN effect a struggle over the meaning of the last 20 years  has clearly been joined These two decades not much time in the life of an institution that traces its history back 2000 years have been tumultuous for the church as for the world outside it Vatican II had declared the church to be the people of God But how were the people of God faring on their pilgrim journey through a most confused era Cardinal Ratzinger has offered a clear answer of his own which in some ways will be the central proposition up for debate at the Vatican over the next two weeks What the Popes and the Council Fathers were expecting was a new Catholic unity Cardinal Ratzinger told Vittorio Messori during the Jesus magazine interview published by Ignatius Press as a book under the American title The Ratzinger Report Instead he continued one has encountered a dissension which seems to have passed over from selfcriticism to selfdestruction But will the bishops gathering in Rome agree that things have really reached such a terrible point And why has this powerful man  whose brilliance is conceded even by his enemies  come to such a disturbing conclusion IT IS IN FACT ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE aspects of the Synod that it is Cardinal Ratzinger and not the Pope himself who has been the dominant figure in the debate leading up to the gathering Vatican officials say that when John Paul announced the Synod in the early evening of Friday Jan 25 he in no way expected the storm that followed As a Pontiff who is fond of anniversaries he was aware that he was up to something momentous and that he would surprise even his own Vatican officials John Paul read the announcement of the Synod after celebrating a mass at the Basilica of St Pauls Outside the Walls Exactly 26 years earlier in the same church Pope John XXIII had issued the call for the Second Vatican Council But John Paul made clear that he had no intention of bringing together a group of bishops for two weeks of partisan acrimony Instead the Pope said his goal was to celebrate the Council to relive in some way that extraordinary atmosphere of ecclesiastical communion To understand why the struggles in the church have become so bitter one must understand just why Vatican II itself was so extraordinary why it raised so many hopes and engendered so much enthusiasm For if Vatican II was about anything it was about optimism Its documents ring out with the words freedom and liberty More than anything Vatican II shattered a tradition within Catholicism that saw the modern world as an enemy to be fought and resisted The message many drew from Vatican II was that modernity had a lot to be said for it at the very least it had to be assimilated Symbolically the Council marked change in another way theologians who only a decade or so before had been condemned as unorthodox or regarded with suspicion suddenly emerged as the Councils experts and intellectual heroes There was no more powerful symbol of freedom and openness Yet the Councils efforts to assimilate modernity and still be true to a 2000year tradition also created the potential for vast misunderstanding The Council called upon the church to uphold simultaneously freedom and orthodoxy cultural openness and identity change and continuity modernity and tradition hierarchy and participation That is a tall order Can a Church that simultaneously moves in these contradictory directions keep enough homogeneity to remain a single social body asked the Rev Avery Dulles Can the Church adopt new symbols languages structures and behavioral patterns on a massive scale without losing continuity with its own origins and its own past THE BISHOPS WHO GATHER ON MONDAY IN THE starkly modern hall built by Pope Paul VI especially for Synods and public audiences have many different answers to these difficult questions The United States will have several possibly divergent voices Bishop James W Malone the liberal head of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has been balanced at the Synod by two representatives personally designated by the Pope John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia a Synod copresident and Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston Both are firm doctrinal conservatives and partisans of John Pauls views In addition John Cardinal Dearden Archbishop Emeritus of Detroit was invited as part of a group of influential Vatican II veterans But Bishop Malone recently suggested that his voice may not be muffled at all Shortly before leaving for Rome he spoke out at the American bishops annual meeting in Washington saying he does not agree with the kind of pessimism Cardinal Ratzinger expresses about the work of bishops conferences In his presidential address the generally softspoken Bishop from Ohio staked out a strong American position in defense of the autonomy and authority of local bishops groups His liberal voice will have support from other quarters Basil Cardinal Hume of Britain whose bishops created a stir this summer when they spoke of a lack of tolerance and a certain new fundamentalism in the church today will be watched closely Some indication of Latin American thinking will come from the progressive Brazilian Aloisio Cardinal Lorscheider another strong defender of local church autonomy Bishop Malones speech addressed what is likely to be a central concern of the Synod the relative balance of power between Rome and the local churches In fact more narrowly churchrelated matters are likely to eclipse the broad set of issues from politics to sexuality that divide Catholics and have been so much part of the preSynod debate There is even talk among some bishops and Vatican officials of taking some of the thorniest questions and postponing them until the regular meeting of the Synod in 1987 which is to focus on the laity In theory the Synod will focus on four documents from Vatican II The Dogmatic Constitution of Divine Revelation On the Church an expansion of the preceding The Church in the Modern World and On Sacred Liturgy Joaquin Navarro Valls the chief Vatican spokesman says the effect will be to highlight two themes ecclesiology  meaning the structure and meaning of the church itself and pastorality  meaning matters of worship and of how the churchs bishops priests and sisters bring its message to the world The Pope added to the sense of religious moment by calling a preSynod meeting of the College of Cardinals which last week discussed a document proposing to reform the Roman Curia the bureaucracy that runs the daytoday affairs of the church Fewer than half of the Cardinals are remaining for the Synod in their roles as heads of bishops conferences curial officials or papal representatives For the first several days the bishops will give their respective national reports Then they will break up into language groups and then reconvene and possibly pass propositions which the Pope will be free to publish or not In the end the meeting that unfolds over the next two weeks will be the Popes Synod But much may be determined afterhours in the religious houses of the national colleges around town where the bishops will be staying in Roman restaurants  and in the Popes quarters IT IS IN THESE PLACES MORE than on the floor of the Synod that the voice of Cardinal Ratzinger will be heard And on issue after issue that voice has already presented a rather remarkable indictment of what has happened to the Roman Catholic Church By misusing the intentions of Vatican II Cardinal Ratzinger says rebels in the church have created a situation in which truly every type of heretical aberration seems to be pressing on the doors of the authentic faith The key question is Does the Pope who constantly praises Vatican II agree The answer is complicated Asked last August on a plane trip from Nairobi to Casablanca what he thought of Cardinal Ratzingers interview book John Paul replied that the book was his opinion That single statement became a matter of intense controversy Liberals eagerly cited it as an indication that the Cardinal was isolated from his own Pope an interpretation angrily denounced by Cardinal Ratzingers supporters In fact there can be no doubt that Cardinal Ratzinger is the Popes man Indeed Mr Navarro the chief Vatican spokesman argues that the Pope sees many of the attacks on Cardinal Ratzinger as in fact being aimed at himself with the Cardinal effectively serving as his lightning rod Mr Navarro a member of the powerful conservative Opus Dei organization and a man who closely reflects the Popes thinking says the idea of the Pope abandoning Cardinal Ratzinger is impossible Still Cardinal Ratzinger is not without enemies even in the Vatican and he has clearly placed himself  courageously in the view of his supporters  in an exposed position There are those who suggest that he could someday be sacrificed to his enemies Mr Navarro thinks this is unlikely The Pope is very loyal to his friends the spokesman says and to those he thinks are right Yet Mr Navarro makes an additional point At the Synod the Pope will say something completely different from what the Cardinal has said How is this Ratzinger is right in the things he has written in the book Mr Navarro explains He is not right in what has not appeared in the book The key to this riddle is the Popes own optimism John Paul intends to celebrate what he sees as good about the Council That he believes is the best way to counter those distortions which he too believes have crept into the churchs understanding of the Council Rocco Buttiglione a political philosopher and leader of Communion and Liberation a Catholic youth group close to both the Pope and Cardinal Ratzinger puts the differences in their approaches in terms of different gifts of the spirit The Pope has more the gift of synthesis because of his office Mr Buttiglione explains Cardinal Ratzinger has more the gift of polemic In a curious reversal of their personalities Cardinal Ratzinger sometimes seems to playing the tough cop to the Popes gentle cop But who is this man whom the Pope has chosen to be his defender of orthodoxy JOSEPH RATZINGER WAS born in Marktl am Inn in Bavaria on April 16 1927 the son of a policeman and a hotel cook The Germany he grew up in was Nazi Germany and he argues that it was Catholicism  a citadel of truth and righteousness against the realm of atheism and deceit  that immunized him against Nazism He even invokes the experience of Nazi Germany in his argument against the growing influence of national bishops conferences which he sees as diminishing the responsibility of individual bishops In so doing he also implicitly criticizes the churchs stand in Germany at the time The really powerful documents against National Socialism were those that came from individual courageous bishops he said in his book The documents of the Conference on the contrary were often rather wan and too weak with respect to what the tragedy called for He was ordained a priest at age 24 in 1951 and in a rare exclusive written interview on nonSynod questions with The New York Times Cardinal Ratzinger described his attraction to the priesthood in mystical terms I was convinced  I myself dont know how  that God wanted something from me something which could be accomplished only by becoming a priest he said As a young man he said he was drawn by the beauty and the mystery of the Roman Catholic liturgy The esthetic aspect was so stunning as it was the real meeting between God and me But his interest quickly moved to the academic When I started studying theology I became interested also in the intellectual problems and this once again because they revealed the drama of my life and particularly the secret of truth he said What interested me was thus neither purely esthetic nor purely intellectual In fact it was if we want to use a fashionable word existential The movement to writing he is the author of several important theological works was natural From the very beginning I had a big need to communicate I wasnt able to keep for myself the knowledge which seemed to be so important to me The beautiful thing in it was the possibility of giving it to others I T IS ONE OF THE MANY ironies of the postConciliar period that Cardinal Ratzingers first major public role came as a progressive theological expert at Vatican II Caught up with the thenFather Ratzinger in the spirit of freedom and hope was a young Polish Bishop named Karol Wojtyla The Rev Hans Kung the dissident Catholic theologian who is now one of Cardinal Ratzingers harshest detractors characterizes his current stand as one of selfrightousness ahistoricism and blindness and says it is something one would not have thought possible in the light of the remarkable theological work which this man produced in the 60s A further irony is that the young Father Ratzinger served as a theological adviser to Joseph Cardinal Frings who could display independence from Rome and during Vatican II spoke of the Congregation Cardinal Ratzinger heads today as a place whose methods and behavior do not conform to the modern era and are a source of scandal to the world Cardinal Frings was not an uncompromising conservative but he was seen in West Germany as leading the more conservative wing of the church as against the late Julius Cardinal Dopfner of Munich then the head of its more liberal wing And just as Joseph Ratzinger was Cardinal Fringss theological adviser Cardinal Dopfner relied on the liberal Jesuit theologian Karl Rahner one of the giants of modern theology and a key progressive at Vatican II Thus it is a tribute to the power of German theology that the new West German leader of traditionalism in some sense is seeking to roll back the influence of the old West German champion of progressivism In the end it was Cardinal Fringss group that prevailed an ascendancy that was confirmed in 1977 when Pope Paul VI named Father Ratzinger to succeed Cardinal Dopfner as Bishop of Munich in March 1977 and that June elevated him to Cardinal CENTRAL TO CARDInal Ratzingers disillusionment with the progressive cast of mind was the student revolt of the 1960s which is critical to understanding his reaction to Marxism in Latin American liberation theology in the 1980s For so many years he said in his interview with The Times the 1968 revolution and the terror created  in the name of Marxist ideas a radical attack on human freedom and dignity a deep threat to all that is human At the time I was dean of the faculty of theology at Tubingen and in all the university assemblies in which I participated I could notice all kinds of terror from subtle psychoterror up to violence This was accomplished he continued in the name of freedom with theories that were so hypocritical if one only compared them with the praxis Up to then I had known Marxism and neoMarxism only from books and thought it was good to discuss I even thought at the beginning that this could be a corrective of Bultmanns existentialism that was dominating Tubingen    However I learned that it is impossible to discuss with terror and on terror as there are no premises for a discussion and such a discussion becomes collaboration with terror I think that in those years he said I learned where discussion must stop because it is turning into a lie and resistance must begin in order to maintain freedom Cardinal Ratzingers first meeting with another man who shared his skepticism of Marxism Karol Wojtyla took place during the Bishops Synod of 1977 I was particularly impressed by his human warmth and the deep inner rooting in God which appeared so clearly he said in the Times interview referring to the man who would become Pope John Paul II And then of course I was also impressed by his philosophical education his acuteness as a thinker and his ability to communicate his knowledge And so was formed a new critical alliance in the Roman Catholic Church between the Polish and West German hierarchies Divided in history the two churches were united now by many things notably an attitude toward Communism IN CHOOSING CARDInal Ratzinger to be the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Pope John Paul made what Mr Navarro the Vatican spokesman calls one the most personal choices of his Pontificate On other important appointments the Pope consulted widely making bows to various constituencies Cardinal Ratzinger he says was very much the Popes personal preference There can be little doubt that the Pope knew exactly the sort of man he was getting brilliant quietly thoughtful and on a collision course with Catholic liberalism and the left It should be noted that whatever controversy he arouses on the outside Cardinal Ratzinger seems to inspire enormous loyalty from his staff of 30  not enough people the Cardinal jokes to organize the theological putsch which some suspect us of planning Ive never known him to be angry or vindictive or sarcastic says the Rev Thomas Herron an American who works for Cardinal Ratzinger Hes one of the most eventempered people Ive ever met According to Mr Navarro and others Cardinal Ratzinger did not at first want the job perhaps the toughest in the Vatican The department was once known as the Holy Office and before that the Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition  not the Cardinals friends quickly point out to be confused with the Spanish Inquisition The task of its prefect is to insure that the churchs deposit of faith handed down through the centuries remains intact unsullied by heresy deviation intellectual corruption It is not a popular job some in the church say it is dangerous that it exisits at all The protector of orthodoxy the prefect is often seen by his adversaries as an enemy of freedom And holding the job is not generally conducive to becoming Pope The fact that the Congregation has shown increased willingness to take action against liberals in many cases has led to fears among progressives that a new Inquisition was beginning The progressives and some who might be cast as moderates argue that the church is abandoning the commitment to freedom and openness that it made at Vatican II The list of those who have come under attack is usually headed by Friar Leonardo Boff the Brazilian theologian of liberation whom Cardinal Ratzingers Congregation silenced for a year What has become known as the spirit of the Council the liberals argue is being cast aside In its place a spirit of Catholic Restoration is at work reasserting old certitudes that Vatican II itself called into question The Rev Richard A McCormick SJ of Georgetown Universitys Kennedy Institute of Ethics has referred to a tendency toward magisterial maximalism wherein little or no distinction is made betweeen religious truths that must be definitively held by the church and others that are more provisional and reformable There are indications that that view may even have supporters in the Vatican itself Earlier this month La Civilta Cattolica a Jesuit magazine with extremely close Vatican ties shocked many in Rome by publishing an article questioning overly broad invocations of papal infallibilty It was interpreted by some here as a criticism of Cardinal Ratzinger Cardinal Ratzinger on the other hand has used the term Restoration himself in a generally positive light And he has answered that the liberals spirit of the Council is really an antispirit intent on distorting the Councils real meaning And therein lies the core of the argument that the call for the Extraordinary Synod brought forth AS THE BISHOPS BEgin their deliberations tomorrow the broad range of questions they may consider will include the relative importance of theologians bishops and the Vatican in determining what is orthodox the power of bishops and of national bishops groups the success and failures of the new language of the liturgy the decline of traditional vocations and the future of the ecumenical opening to other Christian denominations On the moral and sexual issues the questions that divide Catholics include contraception divorce and the possibilities of a married or female priesthood Yet few expect broad debate on any of these issues on all of which the Pope has firmly decided in favor of a conservative stance Also causing broad divisions within the church around the world are political questions What is the relationship between the churchs economic agenda often leftliberal or radical even as defined by the Pope and its agenda on social issues Where do Catholics stand on the questions raised by nuclear war What role can Marxism play in shaping the political attitudes of Catholics What is the precise meaning of the churchs often proclaimed preferential option for the poor The fact is that many of these questions are not likely to be discussed in any detail at the Synod at all As a result said Mr Navarro the meeting could prove to be something of an anticlimax for those who expect immediate results or overt explosions A priest in the Curia said he was worried about just such a result High expectations plus few results is an equation for frustration he said One reason for this is that liberals in the church are often content to have their way locally and then to express polite fealty when they come to Rome As one European priest who has long worked in Rome observes Liberal bishops seem to fall mysteriously silent when they cross the Vatican City limits The Curial official argued that given the current climate  created in part by Cardinal Ratzinger  liberals might be quite content with a quiet Synod The conservatives think they can win this one the official said The liberals would probably be satisfied if very little happened For conservatives the very desire of liberals to reopen questions such as contraception or a married priesthood or Marxist politics is a demonstration as Cardinal Ratzinger argues that they are not in the end concerned with Vatican II at all that what they are really interested in is a new council that would ratify a new liberal agenda But liberals argue that the issues are not as clearcut as conservatives would suggest The Catholic bishops of England and Wales led by Basil Cardinal Hume offered a lengthy and public formal statement by way of response to the Vaticans request for a judgment on the results of Vatican II The Vaticans displeasure with the Hume groups statement  and also with the release of a more moderate American statement  was conveyed to all the Popes bishops in the form of a request that further responses to the Synod not be made public As a result Latin American bishops among others have not released similar statements of their own The British bishops also asked for a word of encouragement for all who have worked so hard for the renewal of the life of the Church since the Council This was without a doubt a direct reply to Cardinal Ratzingers more gloomy assessment of a church in deep trouble almost everywhere in the world since the Council Only Eastern Europe the Popes homeland seems to escape the Cardinals indictment since Marxisminpower has disabused people of materialistic utopias The response to this from the other side Outrage Joseph Ratzinger is afraid Hans Kung declared in a 7000word commentary on the state of the church published in September And just like Dostoyevskys Grand Inquisitor he fears nothing more than freedom Nicholas Lash a professor of divinity at Cambridge argued in New Blackfriars the British Dominican monthly magazine It is not Catholicism that is decomposing or collapsing but a particular citadel which we once erected But the price of freedom is controversy To get a sense of how wide the chasm between Catholics can be one could do worse than look at a recent special issue of Commonweal the American Catholic magazine that last month opened its pages to a broad range of viewpoints on the theme From the Council to the Synod Mary Gordon the novelist whose Final Payments reflected her own experience in the church declared What is at issue what is not defined what is in fact ignored is the bias against women that quickly becomes a bias against sexuality as well Joseph Sobran the conservative syndicated columnist offered a kind of rejoinder The Churchs exaltation of virginity answers something deep in our nature It tells us that virtue means a hard daily struggle for each of us but that victory by Gods grace is possible Such divisions will never be resolved by a Synod though some conservatives argue that some of the problems would be solved if those who did not like orthodoxy would simply leave the church And to a considerable degree the dispute is indeed about the nature of the church itself For supporters of Cardinal Ratzinger and the Pope the church is not some human creation that can be changed at will It is divinely inspired And this has certain implications Even Vatican II after all affirmed the hierarchical nature of the church If one is blind to this mysterious sacramental vision of the Church Cardinal Ratzinger says one will find the arbitrariness of its essentially hierarchical order incomprehensible Indeed For to many liberals Cardinal Ratzingers mystery is in fact mystification a way of sanctifying what is essentially the worldly power of the Vatican hierarchy It is the church as the people of God also asserted by Vatican II that is sacred There is finally a fundamental difference which in many ways underlies all the other disputes It is the struggle over the meaning of the modern world The world is not entirely inhabited by hedonistic bourgeois materialists any more than it is by abortionists pornographers or concentration camp commandants wrote Eamonn Duffy a member of Cambridge Universitys divinity faculty in New Blackfriars The world is the place where ordinary men and women live and must find their salvation The church in one the most widely quoted Conciliar phrases needed to be open to the signs of the times a phrase whose use enrages traditionalists who see it deployed to justify every conceivable capitulation by Catholicism to modernity and secularism On this point too Cardinal Ratzinger makes himself clear in his new book You know neither the church nor the world if you think that they could meet without conflict or that they could even coincide The task of the Christian Cardinal Ratzinger concludes is to recover the capacity for nonconformism and to rethink that euphoric vision of the postConciliar period And in The Times interview he made clear that he understood the costs of the nonconformism he was endorsing When asked to explain the difference between his stern public image and the amiable intellectual his friends describe the Cardinal replied If it is true that a Christian faith taken seriously means nonconformity with a not inconsiderable number of contemporary social standards then a moreorless negative image is unavoidable Nonconformists after all who enjoy general applause are somewhat ridiculous figures or at the least unconvincing B UT IN THE END ONE of the curious aspects of the Synod is that while Cardinal Ratzingers book has heartened conservatives it may  in a shortterm tactical sense strengthen the liberals Nothing could better have crystalized the discussion says a liberal priest in Rome Without Cardinal Ratzinger he said liberals might have gone right down the middle of the road From a sharply different perspective Mr Navarro the Vatican spokesman agreed The liberals will try to have Cardinal Ratzingers book as the central document for discussion he said The conservatives will have the documents of Vatican II as the central documents of discussion The latter would also be more consistent with the Popes idea of a celebration and could be the key to the Synod In effect conservatives hope to show that the true intentions of Vatican II were expressed in its documents which liberals have distorted  often ignoring for example the Councils firm condemnation of abortion The conservatives want to show further that as Cardinal Ratzinger has said the terms preConciliar and postConciliar are distortions tantamount to accepting a rupture in the history of the Church There are no leaps in this history Cardinal Ratzinger says there are no fractures and there is no break in continuity The progressives reply that the conservatives are seeking to so narrow the churchs understanding of the Second Vatican Council as to render it almost meaningless in the broad flow of church history The appeal to literalism is only meant to obstruct or impede a reading of the Council documents which is sensitive to their history says Giuseppe Alberigo a Catholic theologian at Bolognas Institute for Religious Sciences Todays conservatives Mr Alberigo argues are seeking to use phrases inserted in compromise Council texts by yesterdays conservatives to win battles their side lost 20 years ago If such an argument does take place in however guarded terms the Synod could have a profound effect on the history of the church Figuring out what Vatican II really meant as the Pope has made clear is a key to charting the churchs course into the third millennium That is certainly Cardinal Ratzingers hope And while he does not enjoy the attacks he has come under he seems quite willing to persist even in the face of steppedup pressure He expressed his views on the matter in an address to a Catholic bishops workshop in Dallas last year quoting a passage from the First Epistle of St Peter in the New American Standard Bible that might apply equally well to himself and to his adversaries Do not fear their intimidation and do not be troubled    Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you

The Editorial Notebook;   The Unsettling Mr. Meese,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/25/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-the-unsettling-mr-meese.html,Reveling in his debate with Supreme Court justices Attorney General Edwin Meese is pleased to demonstrate that his constitutional quarrel is not just with the liberals of the Earl Warren Court He deems it necessary to correct even justices who lived much closer to the time of the Founding Fathers Hes a true believer in a Jurisprudence of Original Intention and has a fundamentalists certainty of what the Constitution means Interpreting the Constitution Mr Meese says requires only that a judge discern the Founding Fathers meaning when they wrote it Anything else is heresy that Mr Meese feels bound to assail Starting with the Warren Court and its infamous rulings in criminal law Mr Meese has now enlarged his list of errant tribunals Staid old Chief Justice William Howard Taft turns out to be just as misguided Didnt his Court decide that Congress shall make no law    abridging free speech and religion also applies to the states by the force of the 14th Amendment Intellectually shaky says Mr Meese 60 years later The other day the Attorney General added three more ideological deviants the Taney Court for the truly infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 sanctifying slavery the Fuller Court for the tragic judgment in 1896 that states may segregate the races if their facilities are equal and the Nine Old Men who blocked much New Deal legislation in the 1930s But the longer his list the more elusive become Mr Meeses principles and priorities Has any Supreme Court ever been faithful to his doctrine The present Burger Court has failed to satisfy Mr Meese compares its approval of abortion in Roe v Wade to the nearly universally discredited separate but equal Plessy case ruling The overturning of Plessy in 1954 inspires him to agitate against Roe Inconveniently for Mr Meese however disobedience to his doctrine does not explain every misjudgment of the Supreme Court The Dred Scott and Plessy justices thought they were reading the Constitution closely and plainly Of course the intent of the Constitutions framers is relevant to American law But most scholars are humble about discerning the intent of a document written by so many hands involving many compromises and finally cast in such broad language precisely so that it could be adapted to the needs of succeeding generations No such humility afflicts the Attorney General Mr Meeses jurisprudence like his politics is backwardlooking refighting ancient battles reopening healed wounds He yearns to relitigate solved problems like tax benefits for segregated schools and other settled civil rights cases His certainty about an entire peoples history would be offensive if it werent also selfdefeating Dissatisfaction with the work of so many Courts over so many decades guarantees that Mr Meeses work of setting it all right will never get done
CATHOLIC DISSENT ON CHURCH RULES FOUND,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/25/world/catholic-dissent-on-church-rules-found.html,Majorities of American Catholics hold views that differ sharply from teachings of their church on such issues as womens ordination divorce birth control and marriage for priests a New York TimesCBS News Poll has found The poll taken to test attitudes in the United States as the worlds Roman Catholic bishops prepared to convene yesterday at the Vatican for an extraordinary synod indicates that 68 percent of American Catholics favor the use of artificial means of contraception 52 percent favor the ordination of women as priests 63 percent favor marriage for priests and 73 percent favor remarriage for divorced people These attitudes contradict church doctrine Indeed the views of ordinary American Catholics on the issues surveyed correspond more often with nonCatholic Americans than they do with church leaders according to the telephone survey of 927 Americans 280 of them Catholics The poll taken Nov 18 and 19 also shows that younger Catholics are far more outofstep with church teachings than older Catholics suggesting that the American Catholic breach with Rome on these issues is likely to deepen Independence of Bishops The statistics underline attitudes expressed by some American bishops on several issues that while affirming church teachings are subtly independent of the Vatican Some bishops have been more sympathetic than the Vatican to Catholics who practice birth control and to divorced Catholics who remarry without receiving a church annulment of their first marriage They have also urged a greater participation by women in the church short of ordination On the issue of abortion the views of Catholics converge more closely with church teaching Sixtythree percent of Catholics endorsed the churchs position that abortion was murder and only 36 percent expressed support for the current legal status of abortion For Catholics the margin of sampling error was plus or minus six percentage points for the public as whole it was plus or minus three points But 55 percent of American Catholics departed from church teaching because they would allow abortion in cases of rape and incest or if the procedure was necessary to save a womans life The church opposes abortion in all cases a position echoed by only 15 percent of the Catholics sampled Almost four of five Catholics said they felt it was possible to disagree with Pope John Paul II on such issues as birth control abortion and divorce and still be a good Catholic Views on the Popes Actions Indeed only 29 percent of the Catholics said they approved of just about all the things the Pope has done 46 percent said they approved of many of the things and 13 percent said they approved of only a few things The Popes approval rating was higher with men than women and higher with older Catholics than younger Catholics More than half the Catholics said they felt the Pope was more conservative than they were while 10 percent felt the Pope was more liberal and 23 percent said his views were about the same as theirs David C Leege director of research for a fouryear study of Catholic parish life by the University of Notre Dame that has arrived at some parallel conclusions said the poll indicated that Catholics still remain very loyal both to the faith and to the church as an institution but that Catholics are increasingly assimilated to American cultural values Those values he continued indicate that no one holds absolute authority and that the individual is a reasonable judge of what is moral and what is conscientious New Look at Vatican Council The poll was taken to test the attitudes of Catholics on the eve of a crucial juncture in the church The special synod which was convened yesterday and begins its deliberations today will spend two weeks examining the changes that have taken place in the church since the Second Vatican Council in 19621965 updated church practices and doctrines The poll indictates that the synod has not stirred much interest among Catholics with only 4 percent saying they had heard a lot about it and 60 percent responding that they had not heard much Vatican II itself appears to have won the favor of a preponderance of Catholics who have arrived at a judgment on the matter Asked what they felt about the changes in the church since Vatican II 39 percent said they were mostly good 9 percent said they were mostly bad 7 percent they had mixed opinions and 45 percent said they did not know enough to respond Thirtyfour percent of the Catholics said they thought Pope John Paul would like the church to be more like what it was before Vatican II while 28 percent said he would not In general the researchers found that Catholics and nonCatholics by equivalent percentages identified the same secular issues  nuclear war unemployment the economy  as ones they considered important But their attitudes also did not vary greatly on many of the religious questions asked Attitudes on Birth Control Seventyone percent of the nonCatholics and 68 percent of the Catholics approved of the use of artificial birth control Seventythree percent of the Catholics and 69 percent of the nonCatholics favored allowing remarriage after divorce Nearly equal majorities of both Catholics and nonCatholics thought it was appropriate for leaders of their own religions to take public stands on nuclear weapons and arms control the Governments responsibility to the poor and abortion But only a quarter in each group thought it was proper for church leaders to urge votes for or against candidates because of these issues The differences were most pronounced in the Catholic sample with young Catholics more often taking views at variance with the church than older Catholics A bare majority of those 40 and older approved of birth control while 83 percent of those aged 18 to 39 favored it Similarly only 32 percent of Catholics 40 and older approved of women as priests while 68 percent of younger Catholics favored the concept Womens Ordination Is Backed Catholic men were as supportive of womens ordination as Catholic women A comparison with earlier polls also shows that ordination of women an issue that has taken center stage with activist Catholic womens groups is becoming an increasingly popular concept despite papal opposition A 1974 poll by the National Opinion Research Center found that 29 percent of Catholics agreed either strongly or somewhat with the idea of women as priests A 1979 Roper Organization survey found that approval of the idea has risen to 34 percent The TimesCBS News Poll this month showed the figure for all Catholics with the question wording almost identical to the Roper version had risen to 52 percent On another issue 80 percent of Catholics now feel girls should be allowed to assist at the altar a practice that has been adopted by many American churches though not embraced by the Vatican American Catholics do not appear to be enthusiastic about priests and nuns who engage in politics In one of several questions asked only of Catholics sampled only 18 percent approved of political activism by the church in countries where people are oppressed even if it leads to revolution while 63 percent said the church should confine itself to spiritual matters Views on Pastors in Politics Only one out of every three Catholics felt clergymen should be permitted to hold elective office nearly half of nonCatholics did Twentyfour percent of the Catholics  like 27 percent of the nonCatholics  thought it was appropriate for religious leaders to urge their flocks to vote for or against a political candidate because of that candidates stand on abortion The issue became particularly heated in the 1984 election campaign after some bishops urged Catholics to make a candidates stand on abortion a principal basis for their choice in the voting booth Political leaders such as Geraldine Ferraro then the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate and Governor Cuomo assailed such appeals The poll shows that one out of every three Catholics said they attend church every week in about the same numbers as nonCatholics About half had attended either a Catholic elementary school or high school or both How Poll Was Conducted The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted Nov 18 and 19 with 927 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The results have been weighted to take account of household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region race sex age and education In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger For example the margin of sampling error for all Catholics is plus or minus six percentage points and for Catholics 18 to 39 years old it is plus or minus eight percentage points In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll

TV WEEKEND;   A GLIMPSE OF RUSSIAN LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/29/arts/tv-weekend-a-glimpse-of-russian-life.html,THANKS to such carefully selected imports as Masterpiece Theater and all those delicious situation comedies starring Penelope Keith American viewers know something about British television But primarily because of language differences they know surprisingly little about television in other countries WNYCChannel 31 has taken an admirable step toward remedying this situation with a series offered on Sundays at 10 PM called Window on World Television Observing that New York has a sophisticated and curious audience that regularly attends foreign films with subtitles the station believes that the same interest will extend to international television dramas and documentaries This Sundays offering is from France and offers an unusual glimpse of life or at least certain lives as found in the Soviet Union circa 1980 Behind the Curtain Derriere le Rideau was produced by Antoine Fournier who is said to have made 14 trips to the Soviet Union over 18 months while compiling this film Most of the material had to be recorded with a hidden camera or in strict seclusion The opening scenes show the film maker being reprimanded on the streets of Moscow by ordinary citizens We think youre a spy Here come the militia theyll take care of you So clearly this portrait is skewed limited to those few hardy souls willing to take chances Some such as members of the banned ChristianBaptist Evangelist Church are outsiders wanting to vent their complaints Still Mr Fournier recorded a remarkably convincing picture that manages to make its subjects sympathetic as they describe translations are provided in simultaneous voiceovers the pervading sense of gloomy acceptance in which they live A young couple is seen entering a marriage of convenience The man explains that he needs a residents permit to live in Moscow and simply that our interests converged we reached an agreement They have already set the date of their divorce for six months later a ploy frequently used by illegal aliens entering the United States Talking with a broad range of people from a young family to a blackmarket salesman to a woman who supplements her meager factory income with gifts from gentlemen friends the interviewer discusses such subjects as the unavailabilty of contraceptives abortions the purchase of clothes and jewelry from tourists and the advantages of membership in the Communist Party Asked about the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan one woman says I try not to pay any attention to it I just dont think about it You might end up losing your mind Olga a 33yearold house painter is especially vivid as she goes about papering a room while describing her long wait to get an apartment for herself and her husband Her dream I dont have any dreams and even if I did they wouldnt come true And she is not impressed with Mr Fourniers filming her What good does it do me I worked before Ill work afterward It wont change anything for me Although a housewife asked her thoughts about Westerners says They shouldnt be afraid of us were the same as them the film ends with a woman in a shop furiously pulling shut the window curtains to keep out the camera On the whole this is a curious but fascinating film raising questions about its methods nevertheless capturing images and comments that demand attention Coming up on Window on World Television in the next few weeks are features from Japan Finland Sweden and Austria Barbara M Van Dyke series producer says TV should never underestimate the audience  they are always ahead of us especially in New York Amen Perry Mason Returns To NBC Sunday Night Perry Mason may have a beard and a few more pounds The prosecutor may be a woman And Della Street Perrys faithful former secretary may be the defendant But all that proves  when Perry Mason Returns unfolds on Channel 4 between 9 and 11 PM on NBC Sunday Night at the Movies  is that the more things change the more they remain the same Its been 19 years since the end of the 9year run of the original Perry Mason series based on the Erle Stanley Gardner characters but once more on Sunday fans of the dauntless lawyer  again portrayed by Raymond Burr with Barbara Hale as Della Street  will be treated to the customary lastminute courtroom denouement and the sight of a onceconfident prosecutor head disconsolately in hand accepting defeat In the classic manner Perry Mason Returns  written by Dean Hargrove directed by Ron Satlof and produced by Barry Steinberg  provides a murder mystery that keeps the viewer guessing until the final moments In this instance the victim is a multimillionaire industrialist stabbed to death at home on his 60th birthday just after informing his grown children and second wife that he has written them all out of his will and that he plans to install Miss Street his administrative assistant in place of his wife as head of his foundation All the evidence  including an earring a shred of dress and eyewitness testimony  points to Miss Street although the audience knows from the outset that she is blameless When she turns to Perry  now an appellate judge  for advice in selecting a lawyer he informs her The best man I can think of is me and promptly resigns from the bench The late William Hopper is no longer around to do the investigating as Paul Drake But as Paul Drake Jr William Katt who is actually Miss Hales son ably fills the bill
WHAT IT TAKES: THE LIFE OF A C.E.O.,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/magazine/what-it-takes-the-life-of-a-ceo.html,STANDING AROUND A BROAD OVAL table in a partially darkened room are seven men They seem slightly anxious as though they are guests waiting for a dinner party to begin The room has burnished wood paneling tasteful carpeting and nicely upholstered chairs and the congregants are all in the proper attire of business white shirts sober suits decidedly unraffish ties A door opens and in walks a pensivelooking man All conversation stops There is in the way the man moves and talks the distinct air of someone in charge He calls out greetings Courteous words of welcome come back Hello Hicks Hello chief Looking at the oval table he sees that all the central seats have papers before them Ive got no place to sit Hicks Waldron makes a show of protesting Now you do one of the men says as he shoves his papers aside to afford Waldron the center spot It is a drizzly bonechilling day in late February In the board room of Avon Products Inc the worlds biggest beautyproducts company Hicks Waldron its chairman and chief executive officer is about to begin a meeting The meeting is the first plenary session of the group ultimately responsible for the annual stockholders gathering that corporate spring ritual at which the actual owners of the corporation get their whacks at the boss Meetings abound in the corporate world This is a meeting whose sole purpose is to plan for another meeting Once Waldron settles in his chair the group gets down to business Waldron fills a range of roles within the world of Avon coach politician diplomat Sun King Roman god Thousands of people dozens of divisions hundreds of products orbit around him and respond to his pronouncements his whims his vision Like a rising number of CEOs who can no longer afford to be obscure behindthescenes managers box page 76 Hicks Waldron has assumed a public persona Todays CEOs have to worry about numerous divergent constituencies Not only have corporations like Avon grown awesomely large but they are increasingly subject to such forces as litigation foreign competition and media attention The CEO has to be the chief flagbearer not only to his own farflung empire but also to Wall Street to Washington to the press The business of business is now very much in the public eye The faces of CEOs grace the covers of generalinterest magazines and howto books and autobiographies by chief executives appear on bestseller lists In fact not since the days of the great industrialists and robber barons at the turn of the century have the reputations of so many chief executives taken on such Protean proportions Theres the Croesian salary often running in the high six figures    the lavish executive suite    the limousines    the private jet    the power    the prestige    For all the glitter and seeming invincibility though with the job comes almost unending stress Like his fellow CEOs Hicks Waldron lives and dies by quarterly numbers and daily stock prices Poor earnings can quickly leave him an exCEO He must make crucial decisions based on information passed on to him by underlings without being certain that it is accurate He must live in fear of a takeover attack like the one Avons competitor Revlon would succumb to later in the year His personal wealth and position make him and his family vulnerable to kidnappers and other criminal elements What is life like for those who have scaled the corporate pyramid and reached the top What does it take when the footing gets treacherous What dreams do they dream Rare is the CEO willing to allow a reporter into his inner sanctum Most of them consider what they do intensely proprietary Early in the year however Hicks Waldron agreed to allow me a remarkably intimate look at the world of a CEO For 10 months beginning in February I kept close track of his doings There were some ground rules Certain meetings such as oneonone strategy sessions with a division head were offlimits Some proprietary information could not be divulged For the most part though I had free scope to watch him conduct meetings formulate strategies promote his company handle the constant demands on his time and cope with both crises and appalling trivia The period during which I followed Waldron was a critical time for Waldron and for Avon An experienced hand at running companies Waldron had come to the cosmetics company more than two years ago from R J Reynolds Industries the tobacco conglomerate to try to rejuvenate an ailing empire Years ago Avon grew and prospered by following a formula that was simplicity itself It would hire unemployed housewives to ring doorbells and pitch beauty preparations to other jobless housewives Each year the company would round up more dingdongAvoncalling women and sell more beauty products and make more money But in the late 1970s in one of the most fundamental shifts in modern history women began deserting the home and joining the work force in increasing numbers and they werent looking to wander through neighborhoods hawking beauty products either So the pool for Avon to recruit from dwindled and the doorbells began to ring in more and more empty households Beginning in the early 1980s for the first time in its history Avons sales force and its beauty sales began shrinking Could Waldron bring back the magic Could he do it quickly enough so that he wouldnt have to slash the dividend to already despairing shareholders Could he turn Avon around without shattering the morale of a company wedded to doing things in ways that no longer worked This February morning Waldrons attention is focused on the upcoming meeting of shareholders Although Avon stock had traded as high as 140 a share in the early 1970s on this winters day it is worth only about 22 The shareholders will not be a happy bunch Waldron has to fret about appearing cool and confident to them as he reinvents Avon for a new era Peter E Thauer the assistant secretary of the company hands Waldron a sheaf of color photographs showing the pylons in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel adorned with huge pictures of Avon products These were mounted at the shareholders meeting at the hotel last year Discussion begins on what to do this year Waldron looks disconcerted Wait a minute he says Where are these Theyve been destroyed Thauer replies Thats the first thing I asked because these are pretty expensive Well they sure as hell are says Waldron Why did we destroy them Thauer mashes a handkerchief in his hand They made the circuit of the subsidiaries he says and then they got destroyed A publicrelations functionary explains that there were problems making the photographs stick to the pylons and by the time they made the circuit they were in pretty bad shape How much does this cost says Waldron About 25000 comes the response from Thauer Waldron looks heavenward Ugh Waldron finally decides that in lieu of a display stockholders will be given modest gifts Decisions are also made about the seating arrangement on the podium of the six top executives Three on one side and three on the other is Waldrons edict the program Lets just use a card says Waldron highquality and class the beverage no coffee after Waldron quips Lets have Brim I want everybody to fall asleep the office tour OK says Waldron halfheartedly The hourlong session over Waldron steps across the hall to his office stopping to inquire of Maureen Ivory his secretary Whats the next meeting Given his tightly scheduled routine he is never sure where he should be at what time for what purpose She gives him a briefing This for me he asks picking up a fat wad of money He had asked her to fetch him some spending money from the bank Yes thats yours I get paid by the day now Waldron says He gives a short rumbling laugh THE STARTING LINE ACH MORNING HICKS Waldron snaps off the alarm clock at 6 oclock A 5foot11inch wellbuilt man with penetrating eyes and dark hair that he keeps well flattened Waldron looks younger than his 62 years He has about him the whiff of the outdoors He laughs easily and has a penchant for brief tensionshattering jokes He can appear saintly and innocent and he can be cagey He can be warm and sensitive and he can be impatient and demanding He has the sort of intoxicating personality and knack for persuasion that make people forget to think when they are advised to roll downhill in a barrel imbedded with spikes More than a few people volunteer that Waldron is the sort of person you would bust through walls for His Manhattan apartment which he bought in 1983 for 22 million is a sixroom duplex on the penthouse floor of Trump Plaza a block away from Bloomingdales The living room is Lshaped and comfortably furnished overstuffed sofas and chairs antiques a baby grand a fireplace a telescope Downstairs are the three bedrooms There are two bathrooms off the master bedroom Waldrons wife Evelyn is too messy for his taste so he has his own bathroomdressing area For Waldron the hour or so after waking follows a set routine He pads into the hallway and enters a guest bedroom He unfolds an exercise mat and engages in 20 minutes of calisthenics Then he pedals for six or seven minutes on a stationary bicycle Refreshed he goes to the kitchen and makes himself the parsimonious breakfast he has every day cornflakes orange juice a piece of toast and coffee decaffeinated While he eats he watches television news Around 730 he takes the halfhour stroll to his office at 9 West 57th Street The office of the chairman and chief executive is on the 36th floor It is spacious but not obnoxiously large or posh Some CEOs boast quarters the size of an AP The mahogany desk has only a few papers stacked on it There is an unassuming sofa and a pair of brocadecovered easy chairs A pile of Avon catalogues is ranged on the chromeandglass coffee table On the credenza behind the desk is his phone and a framed color photograph of Evelyn Waldron Inside a drawer he keeps a picture of his first wife Peg snapped four months before she died of cancer 10 years ago Hicks Benjamin Waldron Jr was born on Halloween 1923 in Amsterdam NY where his father owned a small foundery that made gears and belt drives He arrived at Avon by way of Green Mountain Junior College the University of Michigan the University of Minnesota General Electric Heublein the wine spirits and food company and R J Reynolds A cousin whom he idolized Jack Waldron had gone to Green Mountain and then to Michigan to study engineering so that was what Waldron did Because he listed his school as UM in his application to enlist in the Navy however he ended up being transferred to the University of Minnesota After a stint in the Navy Waldron in 1946 followed his mentor to GE His goal was to design jet engines which had the glitter then for young men that computers have for todays generation Waldron began at the bottom His first assignment was to test a jetfuel relief valve When the pressure got too high the valve opened and fuel dripped out Waldrons task was to count the drips Eight hours a day five days a week I remember clearly that it dripped every six seconds he says Thats 10 drips a minute 600 drips an hour His horizons brightened after that and he zigzagged his way up the GE pyramid by taking the classic route changing jobs and mailing addresses 13 times He moved from sales training to marketing to purchasing to manufacturing to general manager of a plant that built record players He became a vice president in 1970 when he was 47 the next year he was promoted to group executive for consumer products Waldron thought he was very much in the running for GEs top slot But would he get it Before he could find out he was offered the presidents job at Heublein which is based in Farmington Conn and which among other things owned the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain After 27 years at GE Waldron in the summer of 1973 became president and chief operating officer of Heublein Inc Two years later he became the chief executive officer Things went fairly well until a movietheater and softdrink chain called the General Cinema Corporation started accumulating Heublein shares Waldron tried to stave off a takeover but fearful he would lose he arranged a merger with R J Reynolds After the merger Waldron was in effect demoted from chief executive of a company to the head of a large subsidiary In the middle of 1982 he took a call from David W Mitchell the chief executive of Avon Mitchell said he was getting divorced for the second time and wanted to marry again and to spend the rest of his life having the fun he had never found the time for He said Avon was in trouble its earnings were going down and down and he was tired and out of ideas He thought Waldron might want to be a CEO again Before any decision could be made Waldron of course had to be approved by the Avon board But directors in practice rarely go against the wishes of the CEO besides Waldron was already an Avon board member and thus was well known to the other directors So Waldron packed his bags Once you get chief executive in your blood he once said its hard to get it out WALDRON USUALLY ARRIVES AT HIS OFFICE BY 8 JIMMY Smoak the shoeshine man saunters by and buffs his shoes Meanwhile the chief executive scans The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal At 830 its usually time for the first of the days whirl of meetings At 9 AM a distraction intrudes Junior Achievement Inc  an organization that offers business programs and is devoted to spreading an understanding of free enterprise to American youth  is preparing a promotional film to sing its own praises Waldron a longtime supporter of the group and soon to become its chairman has been asked to say a few words on camera The film crew has occupied a small conference room down the hall from the chief executives office Waldron strolls in His attire  a dark blue pinstriped suit a light blue shirt and a maroon tie is very much in keeping with the approved highcorporateofficer look Waldron hates to shop Twice a year he goes to Allen Collins in West Hartford near his country home and buys three or four Southwick suits off the rack  size 44 regular  a sport jacket and maybe a pair of socks His comments on staff attire I would like every man and woman to look like he or she manages the worlds best beauty company    I think people take the cue from the leader    I dress fairly formally so most people here dress fairly formally    Sometimes I think some of our women could be better advertisements of our cosmetics business A lot of women just dont use the makeup I think a lot of them think theyre being very smart and trendy by coming to work with no makeup Were not running a steel mill or a bank Were running a beauty company The filming commences An hour and nine takes later the interviewer declares And thats a wrap A still photographer importunes Waldron for some shots that the organization could use for publicity purposes Waldron consents and is herded into the reception area Once he gets out there its apparent that two chairs have been moved slightly into new positions Waldron spies several scraps of litter on the carpet that had earlier been concealed by one of the chairs He seems flustered and alarmed as if there were several dead rats on the floor Turning briskly to the receptionist he says coolly Get someone up here with a vacuum cleaner This shouldnt be The cheerfulness bleeds from the receptionists face She nods The photographer begins busily shooting Seemingly hundreds of pictures are snapped Waldron is visibly getting testy Finally after perhaps the onethousandth shot he announces Done and abruptly stands up and thanks the photographer After Waldron bustles back to his office an impromptu powwow is held by Avon functionaries to decide whether a vacuum should be rushed to the 36th floor to capture the offending lint Debate Decision The chair is shoved back to its original position obscuring the offending litter THE GAME PLAN HE EMPIRE THAT Hicks Waldron presides over ranks 127th on the Fortune 500 list of the worlds largest industrial companies behind WarnerLambert and ahead of the Whirlpool Corporation In the beautyproducts industry it ranks an indisputable No 1 Avons sales in 1984 amounted to more than 3 billion Its profits were 181 million not the rosiest they have been the record was 244 million in 1979 The company employs more than 38000 people excluding the 13 million representatives worldwide 5000 of them dingdongAvoncalling men who working on commission peddle Avons beauty products door to door It boasts more than 650 products including Slick Tint for Lips Ultra Touch Hot Oil Nail Treatment AMM Perfecting Loose Face Powder Nutura Creamy WashOff Cleanser and Avon Soft Rose Floating Candles They are sold in more than 30 countries Avon came about through the diligence of a former doortodoor book salesman named David H McConnell In 1886 looking for a product that consumers could use and quickly replace he mixed a batch of perfumes in a cramped pantry in lower Manhattan He liked what he smelled The first product line consisted of three bottles of perfume and an atomizer Drawing on his book days McConnell used canvassing agents to sell the perfume door to door He called his company the California Perfume Company because of the profusion of flowers that grew in that state it was changed to Avon Products in 1939 McConnells company rode the crest of a centurylong wave merrily selling its scents rouges and lipsticks to the housewives of America For decades it never wavered from its core strategy to sell the products that the salespeople liked best run a fortnightly campaign from a catalogue and have the reps deliver the goods to the customer while taking down the next order Growth came entirely from adding representatives and the sales force swelled to a high of 430000 in the United States in 1982 It was then with the womens movement going strong that Avon suddenly found itself unable to meet the need for women to ring doorbells Management didnt know what to do What they finally did was hire Hicks Waldron WHEN WALDRON ARRIVED IN AUGUST 1983 HE QUICKLY set into motion strategicplanning sessions to devise a curative plan for the corporation Delegation performance measurement and planning are the cornerstones of his management style Since the late 1970s Avon had been diversifying for the simple reason that beauty sales were still pulling in lots of excess cash that management didnt know what to do with The company was now split into four divisions The backbone was of course the Avon beauty division In March 1982 Avon had bought Mallinckrodt Inc  a maker of specialty chemicals drugs and medical diagnostic equipment  which accounted for about 15 percent of corporate sales Avon was having trouble though making it fit into the family Waldron arranged for the purchase of Foster Medical a homehealthcare company in 1984 and it was fitting in splendidly The fourth division was Direct Response consisting of Avon Fashions womens apparel sold through the mail James River Traders which sells mens and womens fashions and Brights Creek a childrens clothing directmail catalogue In 1979 Avon bought Tiffany  Company the fabled jewelry store and made it part of Direct Response but Waldron sold it last year when Avon couldnt stop the continuing slide in the stores profits During his first year on the job Waldron carved up the corporation into 32 separate chunks and put them under intense scrutiny The conclusion was that the future lay in seven of them the domestic beauty business Foster Mallinckrodts criticalcare business a small slice of big Mallinckrodt specializing in healthcare products for the seriously ill Avon Fashions Avon Japan Avon Mexico and Avon United Kingdom The decision was made to funnel most of the corporate resources into these seven All the others including most of Mallinckrodt would be potential candidates for divestiture if they did not show new luster Around the Avon water coolers the elite units came to be known as The Magnificent Seven Waldrons overall goal for the corporation was to prop up the stock price He zeroed in on that because he tried to look at Avon as a shareholder would look at it and no stockholder was happy about what Avon shares were selling for Specifically he decided he wanted the stock to more than double by 1988 For that to happen the domestic beauty division had to rebound In mid1984 the division with Waldrons help revised its strategy It confessed that it had badly misjudged the effects of the womens movement The division which would shrink to about 395000 representatives by the end of 1984 had been expecting to recruit a total of 650000 by 1986 or 1987 That was a false hope It decided to live with a force of 400000 and focus on getting higher productivity from each sales representative It also decided to rely less on the tastes of the sales force and instead to study socioeconomic trends It would learn to tailor products to specific segments of the market black women for example and to specific regions The beauty business in general was mature and slowgrowing difficult for any company to record rapid growth in and so Waldron was intent on pushing products that were newly in favor like skincare treatments Furthermore to reach the millions of women not called on by Avons doortodoor sales representatives the company would devise new sales channels It would sell more ambitiously at offices It would try electronic kiosks It would expand its direct mail As the beauty business sank further some radical moves were made Beginning at the end of 1984 the management structure that had been built up to supervise the chimerical force of 650000 needed to be streamlined So 400 district sales managers were dismissed The Kansas City distribution center was shut down putting 400 more people out of work And Waldron wanted to grant greater autonomy to district managers in the field instead of having New York call all the shots With all this turmoil the expectation was that the number of representatives would slide another 12 percent in early 1985 then begin to build back to a level equal to 1984 by years end in 1986 some of the new sales channels would be in place and business would start to pick up In the early months of 1985 the field force did shrink but skepticism was muffled After all it was in the plan GOOD FOOTTAPPING music though not so loud as to still conversation In the Terrace Room of the Plaza Hotel a jazz combo plays lustily Its the annual dinner of the National Urban League Hicks Waldron in a perfectly fitted tuxedo works his way through the crowd with his wife Evelyn a lighthaired woman of pleasant good looks who is in a stylish black dinner dress Chief executives strike a lot of postures Now Waldron has on his public plumage This is a different world for him Faces he has seen once maybe twice many people with whom he has little in common But his presence here matters it shows he believes in causes All his presence really assures of course is that he has had his company put up several thousand dollars to buy a table for 10 at the event Mrs Waldron confides to me that she finds most of these dinners insufferable but that this qualifies as one of the better ones Why No speeches Earlier Waldron had told me I hate these dinners I try to avoid them like the plague I want some day to have a nondinner Ill send out an invitation and say this is an invitation to a nondinner at the nondinner hotel Normally tickets would cost 75 each 1750 a table Please dont attend this dinner Instead send me a check for 85 bucks all of which will go to the Salvation Army or whatever and you dont have to get all gussied up and can stay home with your wife and keep the American way of life alive Im very tempted to do this some day In the Grand Ballroom a loud band plays contemporary music and there is a good amount of sedately athletic dancing Waldron stays put since he is nursing a leg he hurt in a recent fall At one point he drops into the seat next to Mrs Waldron and says Id be out there spinning if my leg werent still bothering me I know she says and rubs his leg soothingly Past 11 PM now and there is a drawing for some rather glitzy prizes  a diamond ring a mink jacket and diamond earrings The ring goes to an elderly quite excited woman who halfruns from her table to fetch it Then the jacket goes to her husband touching off a good deal of murmuring and tittering at the tables Is this on the upandup Good Lord can you believe that Waldron says No one wins anything at the Avon table and now after midnight and with a 730 meeting awaiting him the next morning Waldron and his wife get up and dissolve into the night EARLY ONE MORNING before the usual grind of meetings Waldron examines the Thursday Report It is a famous institution inside Avon It reveals various key numbers including the latest weeks count of sales representatives for the beauty division The new report is full of unlovely numbers Domestic beauty is slipping off plan and doing so at a dismaying rate Here it is midMarch and the sales force is off 17 percent This threatens the entire corporations profits James E Preston the 51yearold head of the beauty division a pleasant man with a pixyish countenance has been living with the sword of Damocles over his head Preston is a carryover from the old regime and even though some of the directors worry that Preston may be overly optimistic Waldron has placed total faith in him The pressure collects in Prestons stomach Recently Waldron has insisted on meeting with him privately every week Part of it is to keep Prestons spirits up But there is always a sobering fillip He knew that if this didnt turn around his career was in jeopardy Waldron tells me He wouldnt be here It was also pretty implicit that if that happened I wouldnt be very damn far behind him For now Waldron decides that any shortcomings in the domestic beauty division can be made up for by trimming expenses elsewhere in the corporation He will stay the course But he also fixes an October deadline for clear signs of the turnaround RALLYING THE TROOPS ELL what do I have to do to improve Waldron asks Look straight ahead when you talk John Cox says You were looking around too much Its distracting Waldron is sitting in a backstage dressing room of Manhattans Hilton Hotel talking with his publicrelations chief about the justcompleted rehearsal for an annual gathering he conducts in midMarch to talk to the troops It is sort of an employee pe rally A pall has been hanging over Avon Faces seem pinched Time is getting short Linda Grimes  a freelance makeup artist who has worked with Diana Ross Liza Minnelli Steve Allen  arrives to work with him She begins putting on splashes of powder Waldron says All Avon products Miss Grimes says But of course Last year Waldron began to demand that all Avon employees use Avon products as much as possible Waldron himself uses Avons Cordovan After Shave On Duty 24 Plus Deodorant Twice Fresh Mouthwash and Naturally Gentle Shampoo Right now he has on a James River Traders tie One problem with this edict is that James River Traders is not known for the exceptional breadth of its tie collection and Avon executives sometimes show up at a meeting sporting identical neckwear Miss Grimes just about done says What do you think Waldron inspects himself in the mirror and says Terrific I hate to go back to the old me You ought to bake it on Miss Grimes peers at Waldron critically but with a smile of approval She says Wait you have one hair sticking up there Can I pull it Go ahead Waldron says Make a wish The ballroom is jammed with 1500 Avon employees The steady murmur in the room stops abruptly when Waldron reaches the lectern To coax the congregants into a sense of wellbeing Waldron mentions that strategic plans have been completed and that the companys earnings are up although there are some bad signs both the domestic beautyproducts business and the directresponse division have had stormy years He talks about new sales strategies recruiting better representatives bright prospects for health care Those are the plans he goes on Theyre terrific plans But as that great philosopher Yogi Berra has said The games not over til its over Well in our case its not over until the plans are implemented And implementation will not be easy Plans dont mean a thing until theyre executed well And that is going to take the best efforts of you and me and every Avon employee Waldron receives dutiful applause Music engulfs the room and he heads back to the sanctuary of his dressing room Linda Grimes begins removing makeup The chief executive says Now the ugly Waldron reemerges COFFEEKLATCH TIME 830 a Wednesday in early April in the small 36thfloor conference room Waldron in shirt sleeves ambles in to greet five managers  four men and a woman  invited from various divisions of the company These are middlemanagement people he does not often bump into Occasionally he assembles such a group to see what they have to say Waldron One subject Im interested in is what youre hearing back about me He is referring to his performance at the big employee gathering One of the men says that some of his underlings thought that Waldron was perhaps too candid The woman says that one person told her he was uncomfortable hearing the takeover discussion Waldron Its like talking about teenage pregnancies Woman He felt that the way you put it no one wanted to take us over we were in such bad shape One of the men says I hear from several people that we need to do more on affirmative action    Waldron Well theyre right It requires a hell of a lot of effort and were not getting to church on time Another man says When you talk to analysts what do they ask you about Waldron The dividend Can you really turn it around Why dont you fire Preston and his people Why did you pay so much for Mallinckrodt and when are you going to sell Mallinckrodt Then the man says Do they ask about direct selling Waldron    the Street is down on direct selling and they question whether Avon can go on with direct selling That of course flies right in the face of our strategy WALDRON IS STRIDING across the hall to the board room where the top executives of the Avon beauty division are seated to conduct a meeting on its competitive situation The primary speaker is from Strategic Planning Associates an Avon consultant For the last year he has been studying Avons strengths and weaknesses Various charts boxes graphs arrows appear on a slide screen They show among other things that home direct selling will in the future represent a shrinking portion of the divisions profit pie Waldron interrupts to ask if the division has given up on the idea that it can improve on home direct selling We dont know if we can grow it Jim Preston says but my view is the homedirect system as we know it today cant grow OK I buy that Waldron says But I see a yellow flag here You start talking about something in these meetings  using a certain type of terminology and you cant shake it    Youre going to get the organization thinking the heat is off home direct selling because its going to decline and Im a little concerned about the mindset getting fixed in the corporation So I encourage you to come up with some other way of thinking about it There is a bit more talk then its decided that the chart will be redrawn so that the HDS segment will be shown getting bigger at a slow rate so people wont think its shrinking even if it is Reality and charts dont always coincide in business OK thats better Waldron says Because if word gets out that the heat is off direct selling it could be all over IT IS 4 OCLOCK ON A warm midApril afternoon and Waldron looks a bit glum The Thursday numbers on the domestic beauty situation are in Theyre still bad The first three months of the year have come and gone and the number of representatives keeps dwindling Minus 16 percent Minus 18 Minus 20 They are heading toward nevernever land Waldron calls Jim Preston into his office The door is shut Its agreed that in late April Preston is to fly to Vienna and attend the Circle of Excellence celebration The district managers who performed best in the last year are elected to the Circle of Excellence and get a fancy trip to Europe Talk to the people there Waldron tells Preston See if you can ferret out why this thing isnt turning We aint got forever Waldron says Times becoming our enemy STRESS AT THE TOP WALDRONS secretary Maureen Ivory a small middleaged woman with an abiding gentleness about her  sits at the portals of authority Much of her day is spent with a phone warming her ear Miss Ivory says there is no approved list of callers who are automatically put through to him but she has picked up on the people he always talks to Many of the callers are CEOs Its sort of like a fraternity she says You recognize other CEOs You always give them every courtesy    It can be days or weeks before a call gets returned Sometimes  it happens rather frequently  one of the CEOs or Mr Waldron gets on the phone and theres dead silence Neither one knows whos calling whom or what theyre calling about One of her regular duties she goes on is to advise Waldron twice a day  at 11 AM and at 4 PM  of Avons stock price on the New York Stock Exchange How does he react When its down she says hell be mad Hell say Goddamn it down again  WALDRON SHUFFLES through papers It is afternoon He says he has more work than he can keep up with He says the problems at the beauty business are worse than he anticipated I know we have to hit bottom he says I know there is a figure called minus 100 Sooner or later we have to hit bottom He says that he occasionally begins to feel as if he is adrift in some alien world Sometimes you find it hard to believe that youre looking at those numbers over there and he points to a chart of a downward sloping red line and then youre having coffee over here with the TwentyFive Year Club one of those wonderful things I have to do Sometimes it just doesnt seem to make a bit of sense Shouldnt he be spending more of his time all of his time on the beauty business Theres an awful temptation to become preoccupied with a major artery severing he says You have to resist it You have such responsibilities If someone is going to sit in that chair he motions toward his chair  and call himself a leader he has to be a fulltime leader and be a consistent leader and not cry or laugh or fly off the handle when thats not the right thing to do Anyone who lets a personal problem or a business problem get to him and interfere with how he runs the company is not doing the job the way it ought to be done So you have to go out to the dinners and look after the other children in the family and laugh and slap backs even though you know theres an engine fire going ITS OFTEN SAID THAT CEOs are overly preoccupied with shortterm considerations that they are obsessed with what the bottom line will show three to six months in the future and with making those numbers bigger and bigger at any cost There is a fixation Waldron tells me one day And I think its terribly unhealthy I have the sickness too He pins the blame on securities analysts who he says you cant get to think ahead more than six months Some you cant get past the present quarter Now why is that the case    Companies like our own have money managers    We bring these money managers in and put them through terrible torture once or twice a year Hows our money doing And if they say its gone phsssst then we say OK youve got one more quarter or we replace you with someone else And they scamper out and say Weve got to find some stocks that are going to go up So I think thats whats driving American business    What are the effects of the fixation Well you make some pretty stupid judgments Waldron says Clearly its highly possible to manage earnings Example run a quarterend promotion that will steal money out of the next quarter    Or you raise prices Or you cut prices    Cut out a research and development item    These are not things that are necessarily good for the longterm health of the company but you need the shortterm profits    It really gets to be a pressure pot Has he done these kinds of things Yup Done things not in the best interests of the corporation Yup MOST CORPORATE LEADers seem to feed off pressure the way shark hunters feed off danger Theyre like firemen The bell rings they jump into their boots and slide down the pole The life has taken its casualties Sewell Avery  head of Montgomery Ward who refused to comply with an order of Franklin Roosevelts National War Labor Board in 1944  was forcibly carried from his office by two soldiers Four years ago Alvin L Feldman  chairman and CEO of Continental Air Lines who had been fighting a losing takeover battle against Texas International  lay down on a couch and put a bullet through his brain Its now a cliche the loneliness at the top But like many cliches it has an element of truth Psychiatrists agree that often it is the icy isolation coupled with undue stress that causes a chief executive to buckle He has no one to talk to He fears appearing human At his office the buck stops Who does Waldron confide in He often talks business with his wife He has his staff and his directors to talk to You discuss different notes with different people he says but you dont have somebody you can just sit down and kick the whole song around with The most stressful period in Waldrons life was in the early part of 1977 He had not yet fully gotten over losing his son Ben who had been killed a few months earlier in an automobile accident only a year after the death of Waldrons first wife Peg He had remarried and was adjusting to a new wife Kentucky Fried Chicken started sliding downhill at the same time that the bottom fell out of Heubleins wine business Waldron began drinking heavily He was also eating a great deal of fatty food drinking 15 cups of coffee and smoking seven cigars a day He came home from the office one day and said he had fallen asleep at a board meeting Evelyn Waldron recalls He said he had to go to bed he couldnt stay awake    He said he had this pain I thought he was having a heart attack Typical Hicks he said If I go to bed Ill be all right The next day he wasnt all right I insisted he go to the hospital He was diagnosed as having pancreatitis The pancreas emits enzymes that digest fats proteins and carbohydrates When pancreatitis strikes the pancreas swells and closes off the duct that the enzymes flow out of so they are blocked and begin to eat the pancreas itself It is incredibly painful Diet and rest are the only cure From May 24 1977 on Waldron would never have another pat of butter Or another drink except for occasional glasses of wine Waldron was confined to a hospital for a month and spent another month in bed He resigned his position as chief executive officer of Heublein although he kept the title of president He wondered if he would ever run a company again He spent a few months resting at home drawing solace from his bride and his daughter Jan then in her mid20s In time he started doing a halfday of work gradually scaling up He wanted to be the boss again but the directors werent so sure So Waldron bargained for his future He said he would turn around Kentucky Fried Chicken in a year If he did the deal was hed be running the company again if he didnt hed be out of a job Waldron spent much of the next year flying around the country engineering a total overhaul of the business One year after he struck his bargain Waldron was reelected CEO Waldrons inner equilibrium these days he says is such that he leaves the office pretty much behind when he goes home In the six blocks between the office and the apartment I can shut on and off he adds He says he always sleeps like a rock RISKS AND REWARDS IS THAT RAIN or bugs on the windshield Waldron asks Bugs the driver says You sure hit enough of them Im a good shot Waldron releases one of his hearty laughs We are heading out in a chauffeured limousine to Connecticut early this April Friday afternoon Waldron has an appointment for his yearly physical with his doctor in Hartford then he will be spending the weekend at his home in Farmington Once we escape the Manhattan crush Waldron talks about security Chief executives have their salaries published in proxy statements and if the numbers have sufficient zeros on the end in the newspapers Their pay makes them targets for extortionists kidnappers and other shady elements Each officer at Avon has a home alarm system that the company puts in Waldron says I dont want any of them to be hurt or to worry about getting home late at night    Every CEO is taught certain lessons of how to help insure ones own safety  like dont develop a pattern Take different routes when you walk to work When you go to church on Sunday dont always leave at 5 to 10 If you have two cars use them I have a listed phone number in Farmington but not my address he continues I encourage my daughter not to use her maiden name Our offices are regularly swept for bugs I have my apartment swept on a less frequent basis Im careful about foreign travel    I have an emergency button at the house and I carry it around with me when Im in the woods picking up sticks    I always sleep with it next to the bed Evelyn has two    Also Evelyn and I have a password that only we know So if she were to call me and there was a guy with a gun at her head and she says Hey honey meet me at the movies she can slip in that word and it tells me that shes under duress Hartford choked with the tail end of rushhour traffic looms The driver leaves Waldron off at the doctors office then takes me to the house The driveway cuts through dense woods rises gently over a mound and then plunges into a clearing where the house stands overlooking the Farmington River Valley Mrs Waldron greets me at the door and gives me a tour of the twolevel house exquisitely furnished in modern style In the den there is a picture of George Burns Once when I asked Waldron who his heroes were he rattled off Lou Gehrig Henry Kissinger and my alltime favorite  George Burns When Evelyn Rumstay met Waldron in the summer of 1975 he was Heubleins CEO and she was brand manager for Snappy Tom a Heublein tomato cocktail Waldron at the time was still griefstricken  his wife Peg having succumbed to cancer earlier in the year When they first met at a business meeting Hicks was so pathetic Evelyn Waldron remembers You could see he had been devastated by the loss of his wife They started dating soon after they met and got married the following May When I ask about the life of a CEOs wife Mrs Waldron says Its a wonderful life in many ways We can afford to do all the things we like to do But on the other hand we dont have the time to do all the things Slam It is Waldron arriving home from the doctors Hes in a chipper mood He gives his wife a kiss and she asks him What did he say He says I should hire a cook Waldron says He says Im seven or eight pounds overweight I said Evelyn wont cook in New York So he said Well you can afford to hire a cook    I told him I couldnt wait to get home to tell Evelyn Very funny says Mrs Waldron Real funny At about 730 Waldron says Lets eat He owns two cars a dark blue Lincoln and a white Mazda We climb into the Lincoln and drive to a nearby restaurant called The Black Olive A pleasant Italian place in a small shopping mall it is one of the Waldrons favorite spots After we sit down the owner bustles over to greet the Waldrons He suggests some wine possibilities which Waldron mulls over before issuing his decision Once the owner has left Waldron remarks proudly that just about every wine at the restaurant is a Heublein product He says that the first time he dined there when he was Heubleins CEO there werent any of the companys wines The following week he called in the distributor and dressed him down How could he allow a restaurant right in Heubleins backyard not to stock the brand Waldron says A couple of times I went to restaurants and there was no Heublein wine and so I got up and left    In consumer products the call is very important I would never order anything but Heublein wine If I ever found an employee drinking anything but Smirnoff vodka or Heublein wine theyd be fired    If you ask for a product then the place has to stock it So its not only product loyalty its promotion Mrs Waldron tells me her purse is full of Avon cosmetics Hicks made me throw away all my old cosmetics and replace them with Avon She later confides that she has a secret drawer of some of her old favorites which she uses on special occasions The waiter arrives for our order Mrs Waldron remarks that Waldrons favorite dish is spaghetti and meatballs though here he always orders linguine and meatballs She goes with the same Waldron cleans his plate although his wife cant finish her linguine When the waiter comes she asks to take the rest home in a doggy bag Saturday starts early for Waldron He has agreed to put in an appearance at a breakfast meeting of the National Conference of Black Mayors  held at the Hilton in Hartford  since part of his job is to massage as many constituencies as possible It is 710 and Waldron and I are in his Lincoln Continental heading for Hartford Why is he doing this when he could be sleeping We as a company have a huge stake in the black community and the cities he says So this presented an opportunity Plus if there is a legislative issue that we might want to support the black mayors could be an ally Does he often lobby legislators Well he says at Avon we really have only a few issues  the FDA occasionally with color agents and such things We havent established contacts in Washington We do have a pretty good relationship with the Mayor of New York The Mayor used to give away a key to the city to visiting dignitaries So last year Avon presented him with thousands of little lapel buttons to give out Theyre Big Apple buttons with greetings from the Mayor on one side The other side says Avon the creator of the most beautiful women in New York and its signed by me Waldron deftly squeezes his car into a tight spot in the Hilton garage We stroll through the lobby Deserted Anthony Carter a member of Avons publicrelations staff spies Waldron and hurries over He gives him a quick briefing He says that in the previous year Avon contributed 5000 to the black mayors This year they asked for 10000 Avon said no This may come up for discussion Carter says Now youre supposed to offer some greetings It can be short We thought you might say something like These are mostly mayors of small towns and Avon is doing similar things trying to improve life in small towns  Right Waldron says The breakfast starts at 750 with some opening remarks a prayer and then a string of speeches Waldron sits on the dais his arms folded looking monumentally bored After about a dozen speeches Waldrons turn comes He is introduced as Hicks Wallburn He tells the audience that Avon does best in the small cities of the country and that the company has a similar mission to that of the black mayors trying to improve life in small towns More speeches The breakfast finally breaks up in time for people to start thinking about lunch Waldron speeds out WALDRON HAS MADE MILLIONS in his business career and he has held on to a good chunk of the riches My philosophy he says is Im willing to take risks and I want to make a lot of money Twothirds of his assets are in real estate and a third in stocks He uses an investment adviser to pick his stocks current holdings include RCA IBM GE and Weyerhauser though he will occasionally bet on a long shot of his own Besides the Trump Plaza apartment and his home in Farmington he owns seven other residences including five condominiums in Florida and Vermont that were bought for investment purposes and a onebedroom apartment in Manhattan in the Savoy a building across the street from Trump Plaza There is a house in Stratton Vt which he uses for ski weekends during the winter For working a total of 337 days Hicks Waldron was paid 500000 last year in straight salary a weekly paycheck of nearly 10000 He also received a bonus of 297105 His bonus is allocated according to a sliding scale ranging up to 130 percent of his salary and is tied to how Avons earnings per share for the year compare with what they were budgeted to be at the start of the year In addition Waldron is part of a performance unit plan which offers longterm incentives if profits grow Some of the perks of the job include a 2 million life insurance policy fully paid for by Avon Avon pays the maintenance of his Trump Plaza apartment a hefty 642034 a month The company has also agreed to buy the apartment back from him at the original purchasing price but with interim costs such as interest included once he retires Waldron is entitled to five weeks vacation but he generally takes only four He takes three days around Easter to go diving off the Miami coast a week in August that his wife plans and doesnt tell him about until the last minute a week in November to go scuba diving the week before Christmas to go to Vermont to ski and a weeks worth of winter Fridays to ski Among the other attractions of the job there is a lucrative pension to look forward to stock options and a golden parachute in the event that Avon is swallowed up by another company and Waldron is shown the door According to a report issued last year by the Democracy Project a New Yorkbased research institute five executives in the United States earned more than 1 million in 1977 By 1983 at least 38 exceeded that amount with 18 topping the 2 million mark At the 100 largest industrial companies the median salary for CEOs was 655000 How does Waldron justify earning nearly 800000 a year He clears his throat Salaries for some have escalated in my opinion more than they should have But everything is relative he says Every year Waldron looks at 27 other companies comparable to Avon and examines the salaries of the CEO the president the chief financial officer on down into the divisions Then he tries to set pay around the averages What about his own pay I think my compensation is about right he says Its about average for those 27 companies And the bonus was a little higher Whether all of us making more than 500000 are getting the right amount    I dont know Waldron is quiet for a moment running numbers through his head As I look around at the world out there Id have trouble being critical of that compensation Comparing myself with a lawyer or an entertainer or a baseball player with 38000 employees and a million women depending on this company    There are a lot of risks The CEO can be hit with productliability suits and a CEO can even go to jail and some have We have products that go on the body and with Mallinckrodt even go into the body    If the companys performance lags below a notnecessarily welldefined standard its bon voyage Then you live in a goldfish bowl Because of the visibility we all live in fear of theft and kidnapping And you give up something of yourself Its difficult for us because of the visibility because of all the responsibilities to let the guard down to relax be yourself DESPERATE MEASURES JIM PRESTON looks terrible He takes the elevator to the 36th floor strides briskly down the hallway and makes an abrupt left into Waldrons office It is his first stop since returning from the Circle of Excellence celebration in Vienna What he found out there has caused his plans for the beauty division to come to a standstill Several months ago at a gathering of the sales managers in Atlanta Preston and Waldron said that unlike the case in the past when all the shots were called in New York district managers were going to be given new latitude They would be handed a budget and allowed to spend their dollars as they saw fit Contrary to what we expected to happen Preston relates to Waldron these people were telling me that not only didnt they have more latitude they had less Part of the problem was that after the Atlanta conference managers were given their budgets and it was made clear that this would be a shoestring year The leadership of the sales force had apparently put too much emphasis on clamping down on costs and not enough on decentralization In my 21 years at this company Preston would later say I had never seen my sales managers as dispirited Communication in a big corporation is not unlike the old party game where people sit next to each other and the first one whispers a message into the next persons ear and tells him to pass it on By the time it reaches the last person its grossly distorted The person in charge of the sales force had been telling Preston that he was hearing good things from the field and Preston had been saying that to Waldron and to the other corporate executives Waldron is visibly shaken by the news Preston wants to make some immediate changes He wants to strip the national manager of sales of his position and to add a few other top people to the division Do it Waldron says And do it fast WALDRON IS THE LAST TO arrive Nine AM the first Wednesday of May and as on every first Wednesday of a month Avons 10member corporate management committee is meeting in the stately board room All the big guns are here The corporate management committee  the CMC  is the top management body under Waldron Although it has no decisionmaking authority it conveys information and opinions important to Waldron so he can make decisions A new face at the table is John S Chamberlin whom Waldron recently recruited from Lenox Inc the china company to become Avons president a post that Waldron has been filling on top of his CEO chores Chamberlin will now preside over daily operating details freeing Waldron to concentrate on strategic thinking and carrying the Avon flag before outside constituencies A matter of some urgency facing the CMC is that business is not living up to projections Consequently the company is in danger of suffering rather poor earnings in the second quarter Poor earnings would put pressure on the companys 2pershare annual dividend Thus Waldron has implored everyone to pare expenses in hopes of lopping off 15 million Any CEO will go to imaginative lengths to wring out the right numbers before he will report a bum quarter Once when I asked Waldron if its fair to say that he does everything he can to avoid releasing numbers that are below plan he replied Do everything is an understatement Kill is the word You have to have the killer instinct for the bottom line Waldron starts off the meeting by reporting some managerial shufflings in the beauty division the aftermath of Prestons Vienna trip Preston has replaced the national sales manager despite the managers insistence that he was not at fault with a rather surprising choice  Phyllis B Davis a petite cheery woman of 54 who has been in charge of communications for the division and has never had any sales experience Paul B Markovits a lanky darkhaired man of 42 who has been in charge of the international beauty business is now executive vice president and is expected to help engineer a turnaround Robert W Pratt the corporate planning officer has also been assigned to the division They are bold strokes The chanciest is Phyllis Davis but Waldron and Preston like her spunk her sharp mind And as Waldron puts it It doesnt hurt a bit that shes a woman Waldron nonetheless has given her orders that cant be blunter I told Phyllis    you dont have all week If you cant get the job done well put somebody else in there After Waldron finishes reporting the news Jules Zimmerman the chief financial officer is given the floor He reveals that profits for the next quarter seem to be below plan He points out what everyone already knows that most of the problem lies in the beauty business which is well below last year Next each division head reports on his business Waldron asks Preston to lead off He troops up to the easel and shows a chart of the number of representatives A green line stands for the planned number of representatives A red line is reality Reality looks a lot worse than the hypothetical What we have here Preston says is a management problem    People arent executing properly Were doing several things Were making some management changes and were doing some more training    We have to reverse those trend lines or those profit projections are in jeopardy We have nowhere else to go in cutting expenses The morning passes slowly Finally the chief executive goes around the table asking each of the staff people if there are any goodies W Thomas Knight the legal counsel says I dont normally bring before this august body little nasty suits but theres been a lot of press on this one We terminated a general manager in Iowa for dismal performance and she sued for age discrimination and theres been a lot of nasty press in Iowa You will read something in USA Today about this No you will not says John Cox the publicrelations chief Did we squelch that Knight asks Cox says that the reporter checked out the story and decided there was no story Well I guarantee you there is no case Knight says We will win this In his office some time afterward Waldron alludes to the shakeup in Avon beauty almost as if it is his Waterloo He feels the strategic plan is right He has trundled out his big guns to execute it It has to work Kicking around in some of the paper work that is so much a part of big corporations is a sort of lastditch alternative It is to forget about being a beauty company altogether and go into the distribution of everything and anything  billiard tables chain saws grass seed Waldrons basic view of that plan is if matters ever boiled down to that You might as well sell the damn company Who the hell wants to be just a distribution company What then if these management changes dont work If these changes dont do it then we have a much deeper problem than anyone knows he says If they dont work well have to make another move But I dont know what it will be ON THE ROAD WALDRON IS buckled in aboard the corporate jet His destination the companys largest beautyproducts facility in Springdale Ohio Nice plane A Falcon 20 Seats six A capacious couch in the rear to sprawl in A phone reposes next to Waldrons seat I have an objective of being out in the field three days every two months Waldron tells me The first purpose is visibility  the notion that the CEO is alive    and cares and is interested enough to be here The second purpose is to gain knowledge to learn firsthand what the hell is going on out here Thats how Preston found out about how we were screwing up the decentralization One way that Waldron fills up his air time is by catching up on the requisite reading of his job He reads Business Week Forbes and Fortune and skims Advertising Age The other large chunk of his reading matter consists of things like economic reports from The Conference Board a business research organization solicitations for donations and so on I usually dont get a chance to read books he says with a tinge of regret On vacation I sometimes get to open a book I like spy stories Eye of the Needle is one of the last ones I read I read Pursuit of Excellence I read part of Megatrends Frankly I dont get a hell of a lot out of those books Wheels thump and the jet sets down in Cincinnati Thomas L Mutach area vice president of the central sales organization and Thomas C Jensch general manager for the Springdale Laboratory greet Waldron with eartoear smiles Riding out to the facility Waldron asks Mutach how things are going and he says that business is sort of slow Jensch too says that things are a little slow Mutach hands Waldron a copy of the business section from The Cincinnati Enquirer which contains a piece on Avon Waldron glances at it and says Heres a lead for you To sum it up ding dong Avons falling Have I read the whole piece Tom Mutach says Youve pretty much read it UPON ARRIVAL AT THE Springdale plant Waldron is given a brisk tour Afterward Waldrons lunch companions are seven Avon district managers Waldron when he ventures out of town likes to dine with sales managers in order to hear whats on their minds What he usually hears are complaints A Michigan woman says that representatives are frustrated by Findings an Avon test of a directmail line of jewelry They want to sell it They also want more jewelry Not expensive jewelry Cheapy jewelry The reps dont like too much to sell skin care But they like jewelry Thats interesting Waldron says Because the future is clearly skin care We cant ignore it It would be like the auto industry saying were not going to build small cars Another manager grumbles about the increase in the minimal order  to 75 from 50  that a representative can submit without being charged a processing fee There are women who work in a doctors office and they can make maybe 30 Theyll take the other 20 themselves But they cant do 75 Lets get back to recruiting Waldron says after a while Im oldfashioned enough that I still say my prayers every night before I go to bed In the morning when I wake up I sometimes throw up one and say thank you that Im still alive Some days Im not sure that I want to be thankful The one thing I go to bed with every night though is how are we going to get more representatives Someone says You know I always wear my name badge that says Avon District Manager and I wear it even when I go to the Post Office or when I run into Wendys for a hamburger    Last week I got two or three different people for customer service and one lead for a rep You use the key trick Waldron asks I was at one of these clinics and a woman told me about the key trick You have this ring with Avon on it for your keys If youre in line to check out at the store and there are four or five people behind you you drop the keys on the floor Later I asked Waldren what was the value of the advice he got at the luncheon Its what I call motherinlaw research says Waldron afterward You know some guy says I talked to my motherinlaw over the weekend and she said dadadadadeedum You listen to it but you dont really look for solutions to act on How sincere was he when he talked about prayer and worrying about representatives Well I was being a little dramatic there he admits When I brought God in I was stretching it a bit KAREN MILLERS HOME IS A modest place in a neighborhood encircled by a ruff of trees Mrs Miller is an Avon lady her mother was an Avon lady Pitching Avon is a parttime occupation though for Mrs Miller also works as a beautician When Waldron is on the road he likes occasionally to shadow a representative or two on a house call Karen Miller has been picked for a visit She is an appealing friendly woman with alert eyes Much of her house it seems has been furnished with Avon bonus gifts that she earned including a Jacuzzi and a porch I never saw an Avon porch before Waldron says Mrs Miller gathers up her sample case and we climb into the car and take off We pull up in front of a twostory house on a treelined street A middleaged woman in a pink sweater and gray slacks answers the door and invites us to make ourselves cozy Waldron tells her what a great house she has Mrs Miller gives her customer her previous order and collects 2340 in cash Then she starts extracting sample goods and pitching them a belt buckle intended as a Fathers Day gift Best day of the year Waldron chimes in some cologne a manicure set a tie tack with a miniature car on it This ones the Cadillac she says so the man can say hes got a Cadillac The woman pages through the catalogue and calls off her order as Mrs Miller scribbles it down All righty Mrs Miller says and she hands the woman a receipt and tells her that shell see her again in two weeks Waldron thanks her for her indulgence Back in the car Mrs Miller tells Waldron Normally Ill stay there for about a halfhour She orders more when we sit there and talk So we talk she orders we talk she orders Waldron who seems to like Mrs Millers spunky style suggests she take on another full territory and then shell make even more money No she says I stay pretty busy Instead of just that Jacuzzi Waldron persists you could put in a whole swimming pool with another territory No she says again I dont think so THAT EVENING WALDRON IS feted at a dinner at the home of Jon Fries the head of Fries  Fries a small but prospering company buried deep under Avons corporate umbrella Technically part of the Mallinckrodt division Fries  Fries makes its money by concocting artificial flavors for foods and beverages Raymond F Bentele the head of Mallinckrodt had asked Waldron to pay a visit to Fries  Fries next time he was in the area He was troubled that the companys executives were unhappy with the Avon bureaucracy and were not behaving as though they were part of the team Jon Fries would later leave the company The presence of Waldron he felt might bring them into line Jon Fries trundles down the stairs his hair still soaking wet from the shower He says his wife Jan is going to give it to him everyone is there early and she isnt even dressed Want to take a walk around the grounds he asks Waldron Sure you bet Waldron says Walking around the grounds  on the outskirts of Cincinnati  can occupy much of a lifetime The place is so huge its unclear where it begins and ends The main house has white pillars and resembles a Southern plantation Cocktails are served Waldron accepts red wine Shrimp and cheese have been laid out Things though begin to go a bit askew The cook it seems is rather forgetful Among the things she has recently forgotten is to start dinner The cocktail hours plod on The cheese and shrimp are being devoured At 915 dinner is finally served Fries makes sure that Waldron sits at the head of the table The belated food is abundant and delicious Waldron tells various anecdotes He tells about a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee meeting in Las Vegas Waldron says that one night he had been cleaned out of his 100 limit and went to buy some cigars He got several silver dollars in change So he repaired to the slot machines He had been trying to avoid a particularly nettlesome franchisee Just as he was about to plunk his last silver dollar into the slot machine the franchisee tapped Waldron on the shoulder As he turned around to deal with him a woman happened by dropped a dollar into the slot and watched 7000 rain out Ill tell you this Waldron says The man wasnt a franchisee next week At one point someone asks Waldron what he thinks of President Reagan Waldron says he thinks hes done quite a good job and everyone nods Speaking of his politics Waldron motions with his hands and says If Republican is here and Genghis Khan is here Im to the right of Genghis Khan Someone mentions that Mario Cuomo could be the next Democratic candidate for President and Waldron says I cant even associate the word vote with him Later Waldron tells me that he wasnt entirely joking He says he is a registered Republican and generally supports the most conservative candidates for public office He favors minimal regulation of business by government He opposes such intrusions as laws requiring motorists to wear seat belts even though he says his son wasnt wearing a seat belt when he was killed He says he firmly supports permitting prayer in schools but I dont come down hard on requiring it He is a staunch crime and punishment man and supports the death penalty He favors American intervention in Nicaragua as well as in any foreign country that poses a threat to this country One subject on which he tilts to the liberal side is abortion He thinks women should have free choice After dinner everyone retreats to the den to watch the heavyweight championship fight between Larry Holmes and Carl The Truth Williams Waldron bets a dollar on Williams and past midnight he loses it The next morning at 745 a limousine is outside the Westin Hotel in downtown Cincinnati where Waldron and I are staying to take us back to Lunken Airport for a quick stop in Glens Falls NY There Waldron will visit a Mallinckrodt facility that makes criticalcare products Waldron is buckled back into his plane seat by early afternoon He has a board meeting of the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company now a subsidiary of the Bank of New England in Hartford at 4 Then he has to fly to Philadelphia for a dinner session of some Cigna Corporation board members Waldron also sits on the board of HewlettPackard The trip has been a frenzied one for me I am exhausted I ask Waldron how he feels I get tired he says I was tired like you last night But I enjoy it    I work hard and I play hard    I have the ability to completely relax at any time when I have to    The thing that gets me the most stressed is uncertainty    Im a firm believer that worrying about the uncertainty is worse than the facts PROMISES PROMISES TEN TOP Avon executives are seated around the boardroom table asking and answering questions This is a meeting for Waldron to practice how to respond to potential questions at the annual stockholders meeting to be held three days hence The investorrelations department has compiled a meticulously detailed 73page booklet of questions and answers If all of them are asked the shareholders meeting will run for at least a month Its slow going Just about all CEOs whether they admit it or not detest annual meetings and Waldron is no exception These meetings have become showcases for the gadflies interested almost totally in selfpublicity he once told me They come with a list of questions and while youre answering one question theyre looking at the next one They couldnt care less what the hell the answer is    They ask about the company planes and compensation and limousines    not the critical problems of running a 20 billion or 3 billion company Its all a waste of time Page numbers from the booklet are called out if anyone has a question he speaks up Page 28 Waldron says Dilution from acquisitions We say the actual dilution in 1982 was 11 percent What about 1983 1984 1985 I dont want to just let that 11 percent sit there because it got better Page 60 We really have to discuss this Waldron says We have to make sure what the top five paid people were paid last year and what they are paid this year We have to get the actual numbers and make sure theyre right    Ill need a two or three pager that I can spread out before me on compensation This is going to come up every year Page 64 Waldron dislikes the answer on animal testing Cosmetic companies are often assailed for using animals to test new cosmetics John Cox has prepared a new and lengthier response which he hands out Do you want to answer questions on animals Cox asks Or should it be Jim Preston Ill answer them Waldron says If it turns into a contest and Im losing Ill turn it over to Jim and let him lose it The questions blur by and then Waldron says The other thing is lets not give gifts Why ever give gifts to a shareholder Someone says Well we werent having a product display this year so you said lets give gifts Well I have a 10year history of saying no gifts to shareholders Waldron says Im sorry but lets not give gifts As the meeting winds down someone suggests that the executives have a pool to guess what time the annual meeting will end Everyone throws in five bucks The meeting will start at 10 and the times chosen range from 1052 to 1142 Waldron puts his money on 1111 IT IS POURING RAIN Every so often there is an explosive crack of thunder Theres also a nasty wind Waldron is all smiles Today is annualmeeting morning The miserable weather is certain to keep a lot of people home and that means fewer embarrassing questions fired at him The session is being held at the Plaza Hotel Its nearly 10 so Waldron arranges himself before the podium and calls the meeting to order About 150 people have spread themselves out in the audience Waldron streams into his speech expatiating on the future glories of Avon He then throws the meeting open to questions A man stands up and says that he would like to suggest that there be stockholder appreciation rights for all shareholders who have suffered with the company for three years and through various upheavals and seen our investments dwindle Thank you very much for the comment Waldron says We will consider it A middleaged woman says that she hears that the company is hunting for other businesses and recommends the travel business I dont know what the return is in the travel business she says but maybe it would be good Thank you Waldron says He explains that the company has investigated the travel business and tested it and had no luck The first questioner gets up again and gives Waldron a hard time about the company paying the maintenance for his apartment This reminds me of the Federal Government in the way it tries to contain costs the man says Boy you really hurt me there Waldron says giving the man a killer glance Well I dont mean to pick on you the man goes on But someone should ask the tough questions And I must say you do it very well Waldron says Very well The meeting plods on and is adjourned by Waldron relieved at getting only one question on compensation and none having to do with animals Its 11 AM  the precise time that Preston picked in the pool Afterward the directors straggle into the board room for their monthly meeting I have been allowed to sit in although everything said there is to be off the record There is nothing mysterious about the meetings They follow a format similar to CMC sessions After some introductory remarks by Waldron which invariably include some birthday greetings in this case Preston also gets his pool money each division head reports on his finances and fields questions from directors The presentations tend to be abbreviated versions of what the CMC hears The 14 directors sip coffee shift in their seats move their chins from the right hand to the left hand and then back to the right hand Directors I talked to admitted that a board cant possibly be as informed as management itself so that as long as the numbers point in the right direction directors must trust and approve what management proposes None of the Avon directors I spoke with could think of any matter on which they opposed Waldron LATE IN MAY PAUL MARkovits and Phyllis Davis the team that Waldron and Preston put in earlier in the month to rescue the beauty business troop into a conference room Waiting for them are the brass Markovits and Mrs Davis have mapped out a plan to resuscitate the beauty business and now need the corporate blessing After they were installed in their new positions Markovits and Mrs Davis hired a consultant to study the last five years of recruitment history in the division and to evaluate Avons programs to attract new blood A model was drawn up It is now unveiled Markovits and Mrs Davis talk At the end of the year the domestic beauty business will be down 15 percent in representatives unless Waldron allows them to spend several million dollars I was asked not to use the precise sum to do four broad things improve morale add people to recruit reps cut the fee  to as low as 5  that representatives have to pay to sign up and sweeten the incentives for district managers Markovits and Mrs Davis have come to a number of conclusions First they say this is a loving hugging type of business and so they want to send a gift a Christmas ornament and a letter to all the representatives telling them how much New York loves them Secondly the product line has gotten boring There is also trouble with the gift and decorative line which accounts for a fifth of sales Avons core customers arent rich yet to get more revenues the marketing people have been inserting higher and higher priced gifts into the line including a 75 handcarved wooden duck Markovits and Mrs Davis want to dump a good portion of the Christmas gift line and substitute cheaper products Waldron studies the chart It shows that if the millions are spent the sales force will at once stabilize and start climbing upward So go spend the money he tells them But he also makes one thing clear His patience is running out IN THE MONTHS OF MEETings that I sat in on I never heard Waldron raise his voice or saw his face flush although there were occasions when he was testy with someone One day I mentioned this Sometimes I get mad as a son of a bitch he said Then I remember what my Dad told me Only dogs get mad People get angry    A leader cannot display emotion A leader cannot chastise a person in a crowd  and a crowd is three or more I asked Waldron if he got depressed expecting to hear some dreadful tale about a company debacle Yes came his reply Ill tell you something that depressed me almost more than anything since my son died After my first wife died I bought a cemetery lot You always buy a cemetery lot under great pressure So my daughter son and I went to a cemetery and I said that my wife just died and I need a lot The guy took us out on a tour of the cemetery I wasnt really all that goddamn interested He said How big did you want it And I said Well big enough for her and myself and I guess my son and daughter It was like making a longterm forecast in two minutes How do they come I asked in twos and fours And he said they were in fours and eights And I said OK well take that one for eight figuring for grandchildren and all It had four spaces above and four below I wrote out a check The next year my son died and so back I went to the plot Last Sunday Evelyn and I went to the cemetery as we do almost every other Sunday We water the flowers and say a prayer Theres a little garden there My wife loved flowers So we went there and watered and did some weeding and we looked down and two of the other top graves were used and had been used for some time I was grossly disturbed I played golf that afternoon and my stomach was in knots I know I bought those eight lots PAUL MARKOVITS IS ANXious Phyllis Davis is anxious Four weeks have lapsed since they were sent off with millions of dollars They have worked feverishly 48hour days says Markovits The time has come for them to give Waldron an update Waldrons gaze slides rapidly over their chart Not only havent the numbers shot upward they have sunk a bit further Markovits sheepishly explains that he and Mrs Davis have been too optimistic They underestimated how rotten morale was They tell Waldron they can still deliver the results Just one thing Could they have another million dollars Waldron is brusque this day He OKs the money Then like a teacher addressing a student who has spent most of the class hurling erasers at his head he asks Markovits if he can remain a moment after Mrs Davis has left Markovits later described the private exchange He said he was tired of hearing promises and having us not deliver on them He said that by Oct 1 if we are not on a clear path to recovery then we are going to have to reexamine our strategy and find out if we really even know what is driving our business LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL THE PEOPLE at Mallinckrodt have not been having a lot of fun Three years ago when the company was bought the domestic beauty business had not yet gone into such desperate straits and expectations were that generous infusions of money would make Mallinckrodt grow Once the bad times started rolling Mallinckrodt found itself squeezed for money to prop up the beauty division Ray Bentele the head of Mallinckrodt could be excused for feeling like a teenager who not only wasnt getting his 2 allowance but was now being asked to give his parents 3 a week In midJuly Bentele seeks an audience with Waldron He comes straight to the point Almost a year ago Waldron had mentioned to Bentele that Mallinckrodts fit with Avon had begun to bother him He had told Bentele that if his management team thought they might want to buy the company Waldron would be all ears This July day Bentele wants to know if the offer still stands Waldron says it does but he doesnt want to dillydally Bentele has two weeks to come up with a price If its too low he warns then Avon will put Mallinckrodt up for sale to all comers WALDRON TAKES HIS place at the head of the private luncheon table in dining room 4 He is lunching with several top officers of a major New York bank from which Avon borrows money The bankers requested anonymity Avon transacts business with a dozen or so big banks in New York and protocol dictates that Waldron and the chief executive of each of its lenders eat together at least once a year The luncheon order is taken The banks CEO says Now Hicks youve been here what about two years Yes Where are you in your plans Waldron says Id say were about three months behind where wed like to be but directionally right where we want to be The banks CEO chews on a roll and nods Waldron says One of the things weve managed to do is increase productivity of our reps by 15 percent    One thing were doing is instead of knocking harder and harder on that door hoping the person who isnt there will answer were going to where she is Were selling right in your office What the banks CEO says astonished One of the bankers comments jokingly That 15 percent increase in productivity is matched by a 15 percent decline on our side Another of the bankers asks Whats your market in mens products    Ill tell you this every time my wife goes to Georgette Klinger for a facial she says When are you going  I had a facial Waldron says Terrific experience I tried one of those seaweed products or whatever they are that you put on yourself the banks CEO says But I dont have the nerve to go to one of those places where they do it I came out of there feeling like a million bucks Waldron says Theres a brief lull then Waldron says We have a great new product thats going to come out called BioAdvance that we cant claim it does but that reverses the aging process Stops it or reverses it the banks CEO asks Reverses it Waldron says Incredible For a month Waldron says I put some of it on the back of my left hand and nothing on the back of my right hand and within a week anyone could have walked up blindfolded and told the difference So thats going to be a great product Everyone has finished eating so Waldron says Well is there anything we should be doing with you or without you Are we doing all right The banks vice president says We do a little bit with you A couple of years ago we did nothing with Avon We think theres a lot of upward potential the banks CEO says WALDRON IS AT HIS DESK It is midAugust In late July Paul Markovits and Phyllis Davis met with him and showed him that after a long stretch of leaden skies some sun was beginning to poke through The field force was stabilizing Now in late summer there has even been an increase in sales representatives But I want to give it time Waldron says Im not sure this isnt false labor In early September Avon delivers a statement to the press saying that the big Mallinckrodt division is being put up for sale Avon says that it will use the proceeds to buy back Avon stock since it considers itself a good investment to retire some of its debt and to invest further in health care services A few days later Waldron explains to me that Bentele had put together an offer but it was rejected as too low More money he feels can be gotten elsewhere Waldron expects Wall Street to react with favor to the decision to sell the slowgrowing division and to invest in fastergrowing companies He is right The stock price climbs immediately the day of the announcement it hits 25 38 up from the low of 17 78 at the end of May Avon which has been a dog with the Wall Street community  attracts some compliments Deepak Raj an influential cosmetics analyst with Merrill Lynch has been complaining much of the year that Waldron and his team were not realistic in forecasting the prospects in the direct selling business He felt Waldron had been caught by surprise Now he tells me that Waldrons plan is sound and he is impressed with the strong people hes brought in and the marketing discipline hes added Hes leading the company in a new direction EACH FALL TO LET IMportant Avon executives know about the companys direction Avon puts on a twoday corporate officers conference This year it is held in late October at the ScanticonPrinceton Executive Conference Center on the outskirts of Princeton NJ Some 70 individuals  all of whom have attained the vice presidential level at the very least  have been invited At 5 on a Wednesday evening the executives drive in one by one The sun is still up and the day is warm Down at the cocktail reception Waldron is in slacks and a sweater looking like an aging countryclub golf pro He works his way through the throng seeing that everyone is plied with drinks There are more broad smiles than I have seen in a while The feeling here is not unlike that of a welcomehome party for a relative who has had a kidney removed while undergoing openheart surgery  despite everything the patient is recovering Waldron and Avon have reached an approximate end to the first phase of the intended turnaround The number of sales representatives continues to climb Waldron is confident that the Avon beauty division has been stabilized and can begin to grow The October deadline has arrived and the decision has been made to stay the course At the same time Waldron knows that much work remains Next year as part of phase two of the turnaround new channels of distribution must be put in place and there is no telling how well they will work Waldron also wants to make more acquisitions in healthcare services Waldron has learned some things during the wrenching year The people in the beauty division were too optimistic he tells me I did discount them a lot Should I have discounted them more I dont know He thinks perhaps he should have made management changes sooner Turning Avon around has been wearying Of late he is fond of saying how glad he is that he has Jack Chamberlin to shoulder some of the load The next morning at 8 oclock sharp Waldron is in conference room B delivering the welcoming speech Last year the officers conference was held in Palm Springs and Waldron told the group that if the numbers in the coming year were lousy the next meeting would be conducted on Rikers Island Our performance isnt Rikers Island bad he says but it sure isnt Palm Springs good He reviews Avons recent tribulations and says Things are looking up but were nowhere near home free We still have a full plate of problems and opportunities Many of our employees are still concerned about the future But the eternal optimist in him soon bubbles to the surface The promise is so great he says So many departments and divisions are on the brink of blasting off into higher orbits that I have to take a cold shower before meeting with securities analysts IN EARLY NOVEMBER THE Avon board approves the 50centashare dividend for the fourth quarter keeping it at the level its been for 14 consecutive quarters Other things are simmering on the corporate stove Several buyers are serious about Mallinckrodt and a deal seems imminent Speculation is that the final price will come in around 700 million Whats more Avon is scrutinizing three healthcare companies and expects to buy one or more soon Avons stock trades near 28 ITS 615 MEETINGS HAVE ceased Waldron says good night to Maureen Ivory after consulting the next days schedule and learning that the stock price closed unchanged in a down market He packs some unfinished work into his briefcase We stroll along 57th Street and at Lexington turn to walk up to 60th Street A snaggletoothed man at the curb steps forward and asks Waldron if hes interested in buying any steaks He remarks that he has some good buys and motions toward a blue van parked nearby No dont need any Waldron says Real fine meat the man persists Never tasted stuff like this I think I have Waldron says speeding up What a beautiful day he says a few blocks later I took the helicopter this morning to Philadelphia It was a perfect day for a helicopter ride The sky was gorgeous He keeps walking He is to have dinner later on with Robert Frederick the CEO of RCA and his wife and then he will be up at 6 eat his cereal watch the news go to the office and get his shoes shined and then go to a meeting and then to the next meeting and then to the next meeting He is showing a bit of fatigue His eyes are slightly glazed He reaches his apartment building The doorman already has the door open Good evening Mr Waldron how was your day Just fine Waldron says Just fine A NEW BREED OF CEO ENTERS THE PUBLIC EYE HOW TYPICAL A CHIEF EXECUtive officer is Hicks Waldron The fact that he permitted a reporter an unusually close look at his world makes him unusual But he typifies an evolving breed of CEOs who have stepped out of their rarefied executive offices and into the public eye Until fairly recently the most obvious trait of the CEO was his relentless dullness There was the gray flannel suit the obsession with crunching numbers the belief that the best way to run a company was to build up a bureaucracy The boss was unapproachable Faced with increased foreign competition the takeover phenomenon the switch from a manufacturing to a service and information economy todays CEOs  people like Lee A Iacocca of Chrysler Roger B Smith of General Motors John F Welch Jr of General Electric and John F Akers of IBM  eschew the old ways of managing and have brought new excitement to rusty companies These bosses detest bureaucracy and revere decentralization Intrapreneurship encouraging an independent entrepreneurial spirit within large corporations is a new buzzword These CEOs hop into their corporate jets and confront the troops  management by walking around  slapping backs and inspiring through the force of their own charisma and speechifying Business executives like Presidents and premiers must demonstrate a mastery of the powerful new communications tools says Lester Korn the head of the executiverecruitment firm of KornFerry International And to reach the top rungs they must be media stars Todays CEO speaks openly He cracks jokes lets cameras follow him on excursions to hunt wild boars Lee Iacocca one of the more showy examples of this evolving breed stars in Chrysler commercials Ten years ago it was a rarity for CEOs to talk to so many different publics Korn says but the media are covering business much more today The CEO    has to be out talking to the public talking to politicians talking to his customers The cloth out of which CEOs are cut is not markedly different from a decade ago as shown in a recent review of 287 CEOs by The Conference Board a business research organization and in an ongoing inquiry by KornFerry into the CEOs of the nations largest corporations The typical CEO according to KornFerry is 51 male white Protestant educated at a state college with an MBA or some other advanced degree from a school such as Harvard Columbia or the University of Michigan He is politically conservative a registered Republican married with three children works 56 hours a week takes 14 vacation days is on the road 10 weeks a year Women and blacks are still largely excluded from CEO ranks In the Fortune 500 list of the biggest industrial corporations there is only one female CEO  Katharine Graham of the Washington Post Company There are no blacks Engineering according to The Conference Board dominates these mens educational backgrounds followed by finance Graduate degrees are increasingly a must about onethird of CEOs claim an MBA or its equivalent According to KornFerry most CEOs rose to the top through finance accounting sales or marketing With the increasing demand to raise the corporate flag before multiple constituencies marketing and sales expertise is currently seen as the fastest track to the top John Akers of IBM began as a salesman Publicrelations aides are vital to todays CEOs their offices often located right on the executive floor At preWaldron Avon there was no corporate communications executive and the top brass rarely talked to the press Peer pressure has become a more important force with the new visibility of corporate chieftains The great bulk of companies are based in a halfdozen cities says Korn These guys sit on each others boards They run into each other at charitable events and Republican fundraising events CEOs care greatly about their national reputation
NOW SEEKS TO REKINDLE ENTHUSIASM OF PAST,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/nyregion/now-seeks-to-rekindle-enthusiasm-of-past.html,AFTER a sea of empty chairs greeted panelists at a recent meeting of the MidFairfield County chapter of the National Organization for Women the president Ruth Lyon decided to poll members to see why attendance had been dropping off and what might be done to regenerate interest She was not alone in her concern Since the failure of the proposed equal rights amendment in 1983 and the defeat of the Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine A Ferraro in last years election NOW leaders around the state have been struggling to find ways to sustain enthusiasm and bolster membership in the feminist organization Many of their suggestions already seem to be turning the organization around Statewide membership which stood at around 5000 in 1983 dropped by 40 percent after the proposed equal rights amendment failed to become part of the Constitution said Gayle Brooks NOW coordinator for the state Though the numbers have been rising in the past year they have yet to match the highest membership mark she said No new chapters have been added to the 15 in existence in 1983 and one in Torrington recently ceased operations she said From her survey Mrs Lyon found that many of the women felt overextended simultaneously juggling job children and home responsibilities They said there was no way they could make it to meetings too she said Others felt let down I was disappointed after the Presidential election explained Bernardine DiVecchio former treasurer of the MidFairfield chapter who now rarely goes to meetings which are held in Westport Perhaps this is not the way to go Maybe we need to be working with groups that represent both sexes Still others feared that the movement lacked a headline issue Theres no sense of urgency said Patricia Russo chairman of the Connecticut Commission on the Status of Women and a member of the Stamford chapter of NOW Nothing to rally the troops Though abortion rights seems to draw the most response leaders acknowledged that it does not generate the same strong enthusiasm as in the early days of the organization There is also the sense among NOW leaders that women especially young ones have become too selfcentered Theres a strong feeling that Ive made it and I am OK so why should I bother  said the acting president of the Bridgeport chapter Sharon McClure who is mostly know as Sam Such attitudes trouble leaders of the womens movement who fear that if women do not continue to show resolve many of the hardwon gains will gradually be eroded and the difficult economic issues still facing women may no longer be considered worth bothering about Thus the emphasis around the state lately has been on diversification making changes on a chapterbychapter basis to reflect the need for different approaches in different communities Sometimes it is being done by simply changing the time and tenor of the gatherings The Greenwich chapter for example was able to muster more enthusiasm and higher attendance when it changed its regular meetings from formal gatherings at the local YWCA to potluck dinners at members homes This way the women could come along right after work and socialize in a more relaxed way said Carolyn Hopley the chapter president In Bridgeport the focus has been on forming coalitions with other community groups such as Action for Community Renewal Now or Acorn an advocacy group that works to help lowincome people By working together on issues of mutual concern members hope to make friends and influence foes And it has been working We find we really do pick up most of our new members this way said Miss McClure Right now she said chapter members are supporting efforts of neighborhood groups to get more money for lowcost housing  a particular problem for lowincome women especially single mothers That drive Miss McClure said has even helped the chapter form an alliance with the Archdiocese of Bridgeport which for a long time opposed NOW primarily because of NOWs prochoice stand on abortion rights In a similar way the chapter hopes to reach women working in teacher organizations real estate and various church ventures she added Some chapters are also getting away from holding regular meetings and rallying members only when a project needs their efforts The Stamford chapter has been successful in getting members not otherwise active to escort women going to the local Planned Parenthood clinic taking them sometimes through hostile picket lines Mrs Russo said I think we can be far more effective by concentrating on shortterm tasks said Mrs Russo Some members also are spending more time lobbying state legislators to try to effect on the state level what may be unlikely achieved nationally in such areas as pay equity childcare opportunities and enforcement of childsupport payments Nevertheless NOW leaders are still troubled that few women under the age of 40 show an interest in joining the organization To do this said Miss McClure it may be necessary to devote more attention to issues that concern this age group  such as date rape and more subtle forms of discrimination in the workplace especially regarding promotions Encouraging men to join and working with them may be more appropriate to the 80s other members believe The Bridgeport chapter has been encouraging men to join through its work with voter registration Joseph Grabarz administrative assistant to Thomas Bucci the new Democratic Mayor of Bridgeport said he first came into contact with NOW members while working with them on voter registration Recently he decided to join the organization Their dedication really impressed me he said I am a feminist I had supported ERA I felt this was a way I could continue to work for womens rights Its been great he added Not once have I been made to feel like a token
UNION CARBIDE LEAK IN INDIA SAID TO POSELONG-TERM RISK,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/us/union-carbide-leak-in-india-said-to-poselong-term-risk.html,Medical studies conducted in the year since the chemical leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal India indicate that the chemical responsible for the accident causes serious longterm health problems that were unknown before the disaster In addition many American and Indian medical experts say that increasing clinical evidence compiled since the accident shows that the more than 2000 deaths and 200000 injuries were not caused solely by the leak of the chemical methyl isocyanate a pesticide ingredient Instead they asserted some methyl isocyanate broke down into hydrogen cyanide a poison used in the Nazi gas chambers during World War II before toxic material escaped from a storage tank the night of Dec 23 The Union Carbide Corporation has repeatedly asserted that based on its own evidence and information cyanide was not involved in the accident Partly as a result Indian officials have said a cyanide antidote was not used to help victims until several months later The issue has become the major medical controversy Indian and American medical experts say Dozens of studies in the United States India and elsewhere are under way and preliminary results from some of them are being used to aid victims of the chemical leak which was the worst industrial accident in history But experts conducting a few of the most important studies say they do not plan to release any data until next year when their studies are complete At the same time recent surveys in Bhopal indicate that 500 to 1000 people have died in the last year as a result of the accident That is in addition to the 2000 to 3000 deaths that most authorities now estimate occurred at the time of the leak Weakness and Failing Health Most of the deaths in the last year have been the result of general weakness and failing health directly related to exposure to the leaking gas and of infections such as pneumonia Indian researchers said According to the new medical information the twohour exposure to gas escaping from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal caused longterm damage to the lungs eyes nervous system kidneys liver blood and female reproductive organs This information contradicts statements in the days after the accident by some Indian and American medical authorities who asserted that there would be few longterm health problems According to a variety of medical authorities in India a year after the accident an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the 200000 people injured are still seriously affected by the leak involving methyl isocyanate which is used in producing 20 to 25 percent of the worlds insecticides There are many uncertainties in the medical conclusions including the fact that health statistics in Bhopal and in much of India are not very comprehensive American and Indian experts said Many of those with eye problems for example may already have been suffering from poor eyesight due to vitamin A deficiencies they said The vast majority of the most severely affected people are living in near starvation conditions said the Delhi Science Forum whose experts did some Bhopal medical studies Many already suffer from various diseases especially those related to the chest and weakness of the body due to overwork and undernutrition Medical experts say the lack of detailed studies of methyl isocyanate before the accident raises questions about the medical effects of thousands of other toxic chemicals that are produced and stored in the United States and around the world but about which only incomplete medical information exists Incomplete Information Last year the National Academy of Sciences said little or nothing was known about the health effects of most of the 54000 chemicals used in commercial products Such incomplete information these experts said prevents effective treatment in an accident We just do not have enough information on what happens to people from high shortterm doses of chemicals from accidents so we can devise proper treatment methods said Dr James M Melius a top epidemiologist at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health who visited Bhopal after the accident Jackson B Browning the vice president for health safety and environmental affairs for Union Carbide said in an interview that the studies done on methyl isocyanate before the Bhopal accident were designed to protect workers inhaling small doses in the workplace Longterm effects from high exposures were not studied Its an unexplored area he said No one anticipated this particular problem He said the companys current studies which include the possible effects of cyanide are with animals The company which has offered to build a 10 million medical research hospital in Bhopal has not been given access to Indian patients tissue samples or medical studies there he said We Would Have Known One prominent Indian medical expert who is heading a detailed and widely followed investigation asserted that as many as 1000 of those who died could have been saved if information obtained since the accident had been available to the authorities at the time We would have known the proper treatment the expert Dr S R Kamat of the Bombaybased King Edward Memorial Hospital or KEM said in a telephone interview last week According to medical experts only sketchy information in medical literature was available on methyl isocyanate before the accident That information discussed eye problems respiratory damage and death from high doses of the chemical Researchers say an expert who had recognized the potential health problem made the considerable effort to search the literature and examined the implications of previous research might have been able to predict some of the effects But little experimental data had been collected on longterm effects of severe shortterm doses Possible Effects Not Detailed The literature did not say that injuries could be longterm or permanent medical experts said Possible damage to the nervous system kidneys blood or unborn children were not detailed they added Also a review of medical literature and interviews with experts revealed little mention of cyanide poisoning But recent studies on Bhopal continue to find thiocyanates metabolized products of cyanide in hundreds of dead and injured victims Autopsies have found that organs had pink discoloration and blood was cherry red characteristics of cyanide poisoning Thiocyanates can also be found in the human body as a result of cigarette smoking and dietary habits Union Carbide of Danbury Conn which owns 509 percent of the company that runs the plant has maintained that the injuries and deaths did not occur from cyanide since the chemical reaction temperatures in the storage tank were not high enough The formation of hydrogen cyanide during the incident is not possible the company said last week Partly because of this position Indian Government officials for months did not make available a cyanide antidote that various medical experts say could have helped many survivors and saved some who died some Indian officials said Subsequent injections of the antidote sodium thiosulfate produced marked improvement in some victims some studies said Signs of Lasting Damage A Karim Ahmed research director of the Natural Resources Defense Council a publicinterest law firm in the United States said his studies indicated that the temperature necessary to create hydrogen cyanide 840 degrees Fahrenheit could have been reached Mr Browning of Union Carbide said it is hard to judge the Indian studies that found thiocyanates without reviewing the studies in detail Medical research just being completed also suggests that the eye and lung damage afflicting thousands of people will persist One study at the University of Pittsburgh concluded it will be at least two to three years before lung inflammation subsides That inflammation is causing pain coughing and breathing difficulty for many people Beyond that the study concluded there may be permanent lung tissue scarring that would hamper breathing for life making it difficult for many people to work I am not anticipating that these people will recover completely said Dr Yves C Alarie a professor of respiratory physiology at the university He also said that in a justcompleted study all 50 pregnant mice given sublethal doses of methyl isocyanates had spontaneous abortions This agrees with recent findings by the Indian Council of Medical Research that among victims studied in Bhopal there were 366 spontaneous abortions or 267 percent of the pregnant women That is four times the normal rate according to Dr V Ramalingaswami director general of the council In addition he said 35 to 50 percent of the infants who were born were underweight Effects on Fetuses Uncertain He said his group has not found a signficant increase in deformities or stillbirths But it is still unclear whether there has been any brain damage of infants linked to a deprivation of oxygen in mothers who had lung damage medical experts say One of the most intensive studies has been done by Dr Kamat and his associates at KEM Hospital in Bombay Starting a few days after the accident the hospital studied 113 of the more severely affected victims For months after the accident 95 percent had breathing difficulty on exertion 68 percent had chest pain 30 percent had corneal damage and 22 percent had muscular weakness The study also found memory loss nausea nerve damage including tremors and damage to kidneys liver stomach and spleen It found blood changes related to reduced oxygencarrying capacity in more than 95 percent of those studied Those changes Dr Kamat said could be related to cyanide poisoning Today a year after the accident 40 percent of the patients have improved 40 percent are in the same condition and 20 percent have gotten worse he said While kidney liver and nerve problems have lessened most lung and mental ailments have not he said About 30 percent of the victims have chronic anxiety and another 40 percent have clinical depression so severe it prevents them from functioning normally Dr Kamat said He said knowledge of such symptoms before the accident would have resulted in wider and more systematic use of oxygen sodium thiosulfate and other antidotes immediately afterward 70000 Surveyed The Indian Council of Medical Research a governmentfunded group is conducting 22 studies It says it has surveyed more than 70000 gasaffected victims and 13000 in an unaffected control group It said the continuing effects on the lungs include inflammation tissue damage and excessive fluid buildup Such damage increases the risk of infection including pneumonia and tuberculosis studies found Another study of 114 gasaffected women in Bhopal found pelvic inflammatory disease among 79 percent compared with 27 percent in a control group of 104 Vaginal discharges occurred in 90 percent of the gas group compared with 27 percent in the controls Excessive menstrual bleeding affected 31 percent compared with 12 percent of the controls And a halt in breast milk flow was noted in 59 percent compared with 12 percent in the controls The study was done by Dr Rani Bang a gynecologist and epidemiologist Many Indian and American experts said that even though dozens of separate studies are being conducted important opportunities to learn about the medical effects of a major public health disaster are being lost Hostility due to litigation has hampered efforts of some American and Indian scientists to cooperate some experts said Rashmi Mayur of the Governmentfunded Urban Development Institute a prominent research group said There are many isolated studies but no one is putting anything together so we can learn something clear about the long term effects A lot of people are jealously guarding their data We are losing the opportunity to learn one of the biggest lessons of Bhopal he said
ACTIVISTS COALITION AGREES ON PLATFORM,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/nyregion/activists-coalition-agrees-on-platform.html,ARMED with a new consensus platform organizers for the Legislative Electoral Action Program say their umbrella organization of 23 statewide lobbying groups is poised to influence Connecticuts 1986 elections The organization known as LEAP formed in 1980 as a source of political expertise and volunteers for local and statewide candidates Its influence has grown since then as its endorsed candidates from both major parties have won 70 of 100 legislative races some of them in upsets So when LEAP held its first state wide Connecticut Citizens Congress Nov 23 three candidates for the 1986 gubernatorial election  incumbent Governor ONeill the Democratic challenger Toby Moffett and Republican Julie D Belaga showed up to seek support despite the races being almost a year away The intent of LEAPs Nov 23 congress which was held at Southern Connecticut State University was not to court candidates It was intended to unite the organizations members  citizen womens environmental labor and other groups  behind a common platform More than 700 activists divided into 50 workshops discussing state issues ranging from day care and utility rates to economic development teenage pregnancy and employee ownership Then they voted on a platform for 1986 They were to select 18 issues from among 75 listed on the ballot the results were released last Tuesday The issues of greatest concern were day care pay equity for women affordable housing air pollution the development of a comprehensive state healthcare policy and abortion The LEAP director Nick Nyhart said day care and pay equity received many votes under columns reserved for labor black and Hispanic issues Some people say Those are womens issues  Mr Nyhart said But the people at the conference were saying No theyre not  Its clear there are so many people out there who came because they want to play a role in politics Mr Nyhart said If these people want to play a role in the Governors race they can If they want to elect state legislators they can They now have issues they can hold people accountable to The congress also reflected one of LEAPs major approaches Cultivating future politicians from groups outside the traditional party system One workshop entitled Public Speaking  Are You a Great Communicator featured a communication consultant to Fortune 500 companies coaching those who attended on how to speak well before audiences and cameras and in debates Other workshops featured LEAPendorsed state legislators giving secrets of their successful campaigns One of those workshops called Run Sally Run sought to warn women of the obstacles they face as candidates Doreen DelBianco a former State Representative from Waterbury stood at the blackboard listing criticisms she encountered from skeptical voters That women are not interested in issues emotional not political A woman in the room called out another Look at Geraldine Ferraro She had the wrong husband Mrs DelBianco replied If you laugh they say youre emotional she told the group If you cry they say youre emotional If you do neither of these things they say youre frigid I think you should be yourself Mary Lou Sharon in some ways typifies the kind of person LEAP has tried to involve in elections She said she became politically active a few years ago because of a garbage dump that was polluting the drinking water in her neighborhood in Naugatuck She began running into LEAP members from various organizations at toxicwaste conferences Then she started working on local housing issues too Now she was attending the LEAP congress Ive been asked to run for office many many times Mrs Sharon said Ive got that in the back of my mind She was asked if she would seek to run as a LEAPendorsed candidate Certainly she replied Mary M Mushinsky made a similar decision in 1980 She was what she described as LEAPs first guinea pig candidate She won her first election that year and today still represents Wallingford in the State House of Representatives LEAP has clout and a lot of potential she said during a break at the LEAP congress If theyre smart theyll remain nonpartisan
CHALLENGE ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/realestate/challenge-on-the-lower-east-side.html,FRED MARSTON had hardly gotten off the M15 bus at Chatham Square in Chinatown when Virginia Johnson buttonholed him insisting that the bus stop was a public hazard because a newsstand restricted the exit of passengers Mr Marston spent five minutes hearing Mrs Johnsons complaint promised to see if the stop could be moved it was a week later then walked on to Cty Hall to deal with a myriad other problems As the unsalaried chairman of Community Board 3 which exercises advisory powers over an area that has more municipal headaches than most mediumsize cities he is perhaps the lowestpaid public official with the highest pile of problems in New York Beside the drug crime and housing problems of his district which includes the Lower East Side Chinatown the East Village and the socalled Bridges neighborhood between the Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bridges Mr Marston also is at the center of such complicated realestate issues as publicland use and the rehabilitation of cityowned properties  questions that have spawned bitter quarreling in the area for years and whose solutions may serve as models for other parts of the city And as if his list of problems were not long enough he said he is frequently approached on the street by people seeking drugs or abortion clinics But Mr Marston himself an immigrant dismissed such people as being unworthy of his consideration because as he put it in his cosmopolitanaccented English they were from out of town  New Jersey or Connecticut or someplace like that But I am constantly astonished by the number of people who recognize my face and remember my name he said Rolling his eyes in mock dismay he added There are the community board meetings of course Sometimes the police have to be called in to keep order among the fractious groups that inhabit his district an area that remains the archetypical melting pot There is nothing like it in the world for financial and social diversity he said Poor immigrants rubbing elbows with millionaires people paying thousands for a painting while others steal to eat young professionals who dress like bohemians mixing with the bohemians who open galleries and themselves become entrepreneurs THE area was long dominated by Eastern Europeans Jews and Italians They were followed by Puerto Ricans then Asians lately a second wave of Polish immigration has begun Mr Marston himself may be the citys champion polylingual community leader in that he is fluent in Polish Russian Ukrainian German and Spanish the native languages of many of the several hundred thousand people living in his district Born in Warsaw to French and Austrian parents he delights in showing off his knowledge of languages when called upon to address a Ukrainian civic association or a Puerto Rican wedding He is an outwardly effervescent inwardly composed man who looks younger than his 57 years and radiates a seemingly constant air of hopefulness And he almost surely is the only New York City communityboard chairman who holds a doctorate in political science from the Sorbonne and has studied at the London School of Economics and New York University A selfemployed consultant on international trade he has lived in London and Paris which were among the cities New York officials studied as models when the communityboard system was overhauled a decade ago The boards have advisory functions and monitor municipal services such as police sanitation and parks in the 59 community districts into which the five boroughs are divided They were created in the 1960s and their role expanded through changes in the City Charter a decade later with the aim of decentralizing the mammoth city government Central to the landuse issue roiling the Lower East Side is the disposition of more than 400 cityowned buildings and vacant lots there Who should own them who should live in them and to what use should profits be put if they are sold During lunch at a Chinese restaurant in his district the other day Mr Marston winced when asked about the dispute saying that disposition of the cityowned real estate was the most difficult problem he has faced since he was elected chairman of Community Board 3 a year ago In brief there are three general positions  Rehabilitate buildings for the benefit of the indigent  Keep some space for the indigent but sell some to the highest bidder to finance housing for the needy  Sell all the properties at market value to the highest bidders How to use the proceeds of the property sales was another sticking point Under an agreement announced last month that Mr Marston helped shape half the properties will be sold and the rest retained for community use The city will try to reserve 20 percent of any apartments in the rehabilitated buildings for lowincome families and some of the funds from the sale of properties initially more than 100000 will be spent for such community betterments as the creation of a unit to help tenants fight legal battles with landlords who they say are harassing them WITH the housing issue defused at least for the moment the next big fight is the cleanup of Tompkins Square and the final form it should take an issue that has been argued in the district for five years City funds have been appropriated for the rehabilitation of the park but opinions vary as to whether it should be a true park a cultural center or a recreational facility It often is very difficult to guide the different sides to a compromise and I sometimes think my job is that of a fatherconfessor Mr Marston said I may not want to listen but I either have to or I have to get off the board  and I like it too much He spends 20 hours a week on board business although he also fields dozens of telephone calls a week at his home in an East Village condominium Mr Marston first became involved in community work a decade ago when he joined the Manhattan Downtown Community Council he is now the president  and the board of trustees of Beekman Downtown Hospital At the hospital he said I found the city often unresponsive to problems affecting the institution so I had to learn to be a little more knowledgeable and in community work one step leads to another He was first appointed to the community board 12 years ago by Percy E Sutton then Manhattan Borough President and has been reappointed every two years since He became head of its transportation committee then a member of the executive committee before the full board elected him chairman City officials and city departments are fallable but you cant blame everything thats wrong on the city Mr Marston said admitting that he has sometimes in total exasperation ended up screaming at those doing the most complaining that they could solve their own problems rather than demanding solutions from others He said he has found that officials of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Police Department the easiest to get along with but conceded that his relations with Mayor Koch have been strained Community District 3 in Manhattan has been a hotbed of antiKoch sentiment he said and the Mayor knows it and often ignores our problems He added that he was aware that some members of the Koch Administration werent happy with Mr Marstons registration as a political independent rather than a Democrat If I were to join one of the political parties he said its leaders would end up claiming that they put me in office and demand favors

PUBLIC SCHOOLS AVOID TEACHING RIGHT AND WRONG,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/02/nyregion/public-schools-avoid-teaching-right-and-wrong.html,At a time of increased pressure from top Federal officials and some educators and parents groups for public schools to teach moral values many educators in the New York area say they deliberately avoid trying to tell students what is ethically right and wrong In interviews educators in the suburbs of New York New Jersey and Connecticut said their schools did try to introduce students to values such as honesty discipline and respect for others and for the rule of law But they said most of this instruction was indirect by the example of the staffs conduct or embodied in the rules of the school Values are much less discussed in public schools now than they were in the late 1960s educators say And specific courses in values or religion or democracy once popular in high school curriculums are now rare in part because they are controversial and in part because there are few teachers trained to give them Teaching of Values Urged A broad range of people  from President Reagan to Education Secretary William J Bennett from evangelical ministers to some business leaders and educators themselves  have urged teaching values Educators in the New York area say the appeals have made them reexamine what they do but has not yet made them change their policies While most school officials said that schools can and do explain civic values and democratic traditions they said it was up to parents to take primary responsibility for teaching personal morality because there was no way for a community or a school to develop a consensus on which of those values should be taught A few schools offer formal courses in thinking about moral problems and many school officials say they encourage students to discuss ethical issues that come up spontaneously in their studies of history science or other disciplines Whose version of ethics would we use asked Dr Robert Laber the assistant superintendent for curriculum in Darien Conn Its outside the scope of our charge to teach morals Students Conclusions Sought Some teachers said they often struggled to avoid imposing their personal morality on classes particularly when the issue seemed clearcut to them Many said they believed that students would not make meaningful moral choices unless they arrived at the conclusions by themselves The supervisor of the high school guidance program in Teaneck NJ Jay R Wolff recalled a recent counseling session with 15 juniors and seniors who had concluded that a fellow student had been foolish when she returned 1000 found in a purse at the school When the students asked Mr Wolffs opinion he told them he believed the girl had done the right thing but that of course he would not try to force his values on them If I come from the position of what is right and what is wrong then Im not their counselor he said The concern about values in schools comes from a variety of sources Secretary Bennett says instruction should have a religious content specifically the nations JudeoChristian heritage Secular Humanism Others including religious activists such as members of the Moral Majority want prayers in school Some parents and politicians have protested secular humanism a term they use to describe an absence of religious belief that is manifested they say in health classes that do not teach that premarital sex is wrong or in civics classes that do not condemn Communism More recently business leaders have said schools should do a better job of teaching personal values including selfdiscipline and teamwork ideals that the schools say they do try to foster And educators such as Bill Honig the Superintendent of Public Instruction in California have called for a moral content in the curriculum President Reagan has said repeatedly that schools are responsible for developing character just as much as for promoting literacy or the ability to multiply and divide ValueNeutral Education The American people have always known in their bones how intimately knowledge and values are intertwined he said in a radio address shortly before public schools resumed classes this fall We dont expect our children to rediscover calculus on their own but some would give them no guidance when it comes to even more fundamental discoveries of civilization our ethics morality and values If we give children no guidance here if we give them only valueneutral education were robbing them of their most precious inheritance  the wisdom of generations that is contained in our moral heritage Educators said academic courses often result in classroom discussion of ethical issues American history students talk about the morality of racial discrimination or capital punishment for example The high school principal in Danbury Conn William Ryan noted that business courses there incorporate business ethics I would like to see this more spelled out but it causes problems with parents he said After another moment of reflection he added Actually Im satisfied with the way its going now In Vogue in Late 70s A handful of high schools in Westchester and Rockland Counties offer courses in which students are asked to take and defend a moral position The curriculum was in vogue in the late 1970s but it was either pushed out by tight budgets or relegated as in Scarsdale to an alternative high school where it is not readily available to all students City and suburban schools alike forbid teachers to advocate personal values particularly on topics of current controversy such as abortion or disarmament As a result substanceabuse programs which are offered in virtually every suburban district do not preach abstension from drugs and alcohol as much as they teach a thinking process that would lead students to decide against drugs and drinking the educators said Students in sexeducation classes in Redding Conn talk about abstention contraception abortion and giving birth The important thing said Lawrence Miller the Superintendent is to help them make choices and deal with the consequences Teanecks Practices The public schools in Teaneck NJ  reflect the practices of value education that other administrators described Everything we do is dripping with values from the selection of textbooks to the development of a course on the Holocaust to the personal behavior of school staff members said the Superintendent Eugene F Mulcahy Teaneck just celebrated the 20th anniversary of its voluntary school integration That multiracial multiethnic value is clearly important to us so we put that value in the schools he saidWe have the pledge of allegiance every day to say I am part of this amazing nation  A Delicate Technique Teachers in Teaneck are encouraged to stimulate debate about moral issues but are enjoined from projecting their personal views That philosophy posed a problem for a psychology teacher Gary Tankard as he led 26 juniors and seniors through a class on the kinds of tests used to detect personality disorders Questions on one test measure possibly unhealthy religious convictions he said asking the students to cite examples of such unhealthy beliefs Even in this school there are people who are like fanatics said Donna Williams one of the students They say if youre not born again if youre not saved you are going to hell That really scares you Yes said Anne Marie Mueller people take the Bible too literally Mr Tankard said that he had in mind cults such as the people who drank cyanidelaced KoolAid at Jonestown Guyana Absolutely interjected Gordon Chambers and how about those Sunday morning television evangelists They tell you to give up everything you own he said Its dangerous when people think they dont have a life except in the church Religion usually has a good effect on people said Mr Tankard But the class pressed on with talk about how some religions brainwash adherents and others promote racial intolerance At the end of the period Mr Tankard said he was not sure what values the students had absorbed that day Mutual Respect Dr Mulcahy said the schools tried to teach children mutual respect in large measure by being sure that the teachers respected their students Eva Barron put the theory into practice with a creative writing class for high school freshmen and sophomores She asked the students to read aloud their poems about the schoolyard saying she knew they feared the laughter of their classmates and reminding them that they could choose to stay silent What followed was a lively 45 minutes of reading and discussion and no laughter It like liberates you to be yourself said Paula Slade a sophomore Im not ashamed of who I am Had she learned anything about right and wrong That theres a choice she replied
Expensive Ignorance on Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/04/opinion/expensive-ignorance-on-birth-control.html,That New York States network of familyplanning clinics does good work is beyond dispute It has had much to do with the 25 percent drop in the pregnancy rate among sexually active teenagers between 1974 and 1980  the biggest decrease in the nation But its also beyond dispute that the clinics dont reach everyone who needs help Nearly 150000 New York women have abortions every year Why so many unintended pregnancies Most of the time the reason is simple ignorance A remarkable number of young mothers still believe it cant happen to them the first time That is why they are apt to ask for contraceptive advice only after the question has become academic Many others handicapped by illiteracy or language problems dont have access to the facts and services that make truly informed choice possible A third group the youngest and poorest are victims of another kind of ignorance as well Deprived of hope and selfesteem they get pregnant intentionally because they know nothing of what life can offer them besides motherhood To stamp out both kinds of ignorance a coalition of familyplanning providers and their supporters is asking Governor Cuomo to increase state familyplanning funding by 25 million over the next five years Most of the firstyear money would add clinics statewide and provide free services for girls under 18 The rest would go for information and education and to help the poor Promoters of family planning estimate that such an increase in services would reduce unplanned pregnancies by 8000 and abortions by 3500 in the first year It could also reduce the number of women receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and produce a net saving A state so deeply committed to keeping abortion safe legal and available to all women should show as deep a commitment to preventing the unplanned pregnancies that make it necessary

Third World's Biggest Problem Is Leadership,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/06/opinion/l-third-world-s-biggest-problem-is-leadership-206959.html,To the Editor Robert L Schiffer Hostages to US Abortion Politics OpEd Nov 11 places much of the blame for the threat to the thirdworld countries stability at the doorstep of the President Mr Reagans position on abortion is regarded as the primary reason funding for family planning is in jeopardy While I do not doubt Mr Schiffers concern for the third world  and inevitably our world too  he nevertheless suffers from the same inverted value system as do many otherwise enlightened citizens The problems of thirdworld countries are not those caused primarily by overpopulation and family planning is not the answer Their problems stem mainly from mismanagement of resources natural as well as human and a paralysis of leadership that seems mostly interested in selfperpetuation There is in fact no population bomb ticking away as Mr Schiffer fears There is however a real threat from the network of selfserving leaders who are spiritually blind morally corrupt but at the same time politically astute It makes for a dangerous combination I would not waste precious resources on trying to prevent people from coming into this world The misery and poverty we see in underdeveloped countries is a glaring testimonial to the crisis in leadership at every level And we in the West have offered no examples of selfsacrifice as encouragement merely conspicuous consumption which their leaders try to copy with disastrous results ALEXANDRA MARK Brookline Mass Nov 11 1985
TERRORISM IN U.S. LOW AS ATTACKS ABROAD RISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/06/us/terrorism-in-us-low-as-attacks-abroad-rise.html,Even as terrorist attacks on Americans abroad increase Federal lawenforcement officials say the incidence of such violence in the United States has remained low American society is illprotected and the vulnerabilities of its public buildings military bases power stations water supplies and other facilities worry some counterterrorism specialists But so far they observe the political conflicts that have fostered attacks elsewhere including numerous assaults on Americans overseas have rarely intruded into this country nor have most domestic political and ethnic clashes generated highly organized terrorism There is always the possibility of a spectacular or two said Brian Jenkins a specialist on terrorism for the Rand Corporation But I dont think we are likely to see a sustained campaign Nor are we going to see a level of international terrorism like what France experiences Concern about domestic terrorism has risen most recently because of three arson and bombing attacks this year on offices of the AmericanArab AntiDiscrimination Committee including a fire in its Washington office last weekend But the overall problem remains relatively small The Record for US Good In Recent Years In 1984 one person was killed in the United States and none were injured in 15 incidents classified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as terrorism An additional 25 bombing and arson attacks were aimed at abortion clinics resulting in extensive property damage but no deaths So far in 1985 there have been 15 incidents of terrorism that have killed two people and injured four official figures show Seven of the 15 have been attacks on abortion clinics which have caused no injuries according to the Treasury Departments Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Officials say most of the terrorism in recent years has come from four kinds of organizations Puerto Rican separatists Jewish militants leftwing radicals and rightwing survivalists or neoNazis Some of these groups have been infiltrated and placed under close surveillance by the FBI and local police departments which report having thwarted more attacks than have been carried out The untold story is not the number of incidents but the number of preventions said Oliver Revell the bureaus executive assistant director for investigations Plots have been uncovered to bomb the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House the Naval Academy and various corporation headquarters he said Last May the bureau arrested a group of Sikhs who were charged with planning to assassinate Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India on a visit to the United States Two of the Sikhs had reportedly been trained at a privately run weapons camp in Alabama one of numerous camps that operate legally across the country Mr Revell said that Iranian groups in the United States clustered around four different factions had also been prevented from carrying out violence against political enemies They have an infrastructure designed to collect intelligence on adversaries to the Ayatollah Khomeini he said and to obtain military technology clandestinely from this country Two groups planned to plant a bomb in a Seattle movie theater according to a Congressional source The bureau foiled this and other plots by a method other than arrest Mr Revell said but he declined to provide details US Is Probably The Most Vulnerable The US is probably the most vulnerable to terrorism of any country in the world the FBI official continued Our borders are open Once they are in the country there are no identity checks They can travel freely They can enroll in colleges and the Government can pay their way The US is a country that is virtually impossible to police On the other hand Mr Revell added I think were making the United States a very hard target We have penetrated and prosecuted virtually every terrorist group that has operated in the US using the law That has given rise to the concern that the United States is not such an easy target Stephen S Trott Assistant Attorney General for the criminal division of the Justice Department cited the suppression of Armenian terrorism as a victory for the FBI Others give some of the credit to the Los Angeles Police Department In any event since a series of attacks on Turkish diplomats in 198182 arrests have ended the incidents and none were recorded in 198384 Mr Trott said They have stopped the Armenian terrorists cold he declared Similarly the FBI said that Croatian terrorism by advocates of an independent Croatian state had been mostly ended after a spate of violence against Yugoslav Airlines and other facilities in the late 1970s and early 1980s No incidents have been recorded since 1982 Vigorous moves have also been made against rightwing extremists who arm themselves with automatic weapons and preach white supremacy and antiSemitism One such group called the Order has been accused of assassinating Alan Berg a Jewish talk show host in Denver in 1984 and of plotting to overthrow the Government These are smaller groups and much more violenceprone than the Ku Klux Klan or the American Nazis said Mr Jenkins of Rand Theyre dangerous Theyll kill They have a lot of weapons He said that some members of the Aryan Nations the Sword and Covenant of the Lord and other groups are former convicts who formed their organizations in prison About a year ago for example the Treasury Department said four members of a group calling itself the Posse Comitatus were arrested in Minnesota and sentenced to terms ranging from 5 to 26 years for the manufacture and possession of machine guns silencers hand grenades and other weapons and for making threats against Internal Revenue Service officers Less Success With Jewish Groups There has been less success against Jewish groups which have come under suspicion in five terrorist attacks this year that have caused two deaths and four injuries Several groups the Jewish Defense League Jewish Defense Action and the Jewish Defense Organization have reportedly been investigated in attacks on former Nazis and ArabAmerican groups On Aug 15 Tschirin Soobzokov purportedly a former Nazi who lived in Patterson NJ was killed when he opened the door of his house A passerby was injured An FBI spokesman said that Mr Soobzokov had been harassed since 1977 by the Jewish Defense League On Sept 6 Elmars Sprogis of Brentwood NY who had been cleared in court of charges that he had been a police official responsible for guarding Jews in Nazioccupied Latvia escaped injury when a bomb attached to his door went off A passerby was hurt A message was sent to Newsday saying JDL Nazi War Criminal Never Again The AmericanArab AntiDiscrimination Committee which combats stereotypes of Arabs in the news and entertainment media has come under numerous threats and three attacks An attempted bombing injured two police bomb squad members in Boston last summer and a bombing in Santa Ana Calif after the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro last October killed the committees regional director Alex Odeh At a news conference today James Abourezk the former Democratic Senator from South Dakota who is national chairman of the committee declared his groups determination to stay in business and its decision to hire a private security agency to conduct an investigation He said that he would meet Friday with the FBI Director William H Webster to discuss evidence that he had presented Mr Abourezk handed reporters photocopies of telegrams sent to the committee after last weekends fire in Washington Although they were signed with names of leaders of the Jewish Defense League he said that he doubted they were authentic One sent from Brooklyn read Sorry we missed you Hope to be more precise next time Another from Moorestown NJ said We have Bassam Shakas legs Bassam Shaka a former Mayor of the West Bank city of Nablus lost both legs in a 1980 car bombing by Israeli Jews who are now serving prison terms At his news conference Mr Abourezk also urged American leaders to denounce the terrorists We believe they should be stopped for many reasons he said not only because of the loss of life and property which has already taken place but because we do not want to see the United States turned into another Ulster or Beirut where violence only begets more violence Legislative and investigative steps to combat terrorism have frequently provoked debate over civil liberties violations and political bias in law enforcement with some Americans accusing the FBI of playing politics by declining to exercise jurisdiction over a certain case and others worrying about excessive surveillance if it does Civil Liberties And Terrorism Mr Revell of the FBI said he was sensitive to the civil liberties issue We cant allow terrorism to become a mechanism to diminish our democratic process he asserted Whatever steps are taken must be done very carefully and with consideration of constitutional guarantees he said Of its 9000 agents the bureau now devotes the equivalent of 500 agents a year to fighting terrorism Mr Revell said The Reagan Administration proposed legislation last year that would have made it a crime to provide support to certain foreign governments and organizations listed by the Secretary of State The bill widely assailed as a violation of rights to free association and expression died in Congress But its introduction heightened the wariness among civil libertarians When abortion clinics were being bombed and calls were heard for the FBI to investigate the American Civil Liberties Union supported the bureaus decision to stay out of the cases Opening up a domestic terrorism investigation in the abortion clinic area would have said Go out and investigate and establish all the contacts and persons who may be in some relationship with whoever youre investigating  said Jerry Berman chief legislative counsel of the ACLU Instead of trying to focus on a specific individual and a specific crime you would have been saying Lets target the antiabortion movement and try to infiltrate it  The investigations were done by the Treasury Departments Bureau of Alcohol Firearms and Tobacco which is widely regarded as having some of the best explosives and arson laboratories and technicians in the country The FBI stayed out because the attacks appeared to have been carried out by clusters of unrelated individuals who were not part of any organization Twelve people have been arrested and convicted and 23 of the 37 cases have been solved according to a Bureau of Alcohol spokesman

STATES FOUND IN A LOCAL-FEDERAL VISE OVER SERVICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/06/us/states-found-in-a-local-federal-vise-over-services.html,For the first time the states are facing demands from both the Federal and local governments to expand public services according to an analysis made public today by the Council of State Governments Never before have the states been looked to by both their Federal and local partners as leaders in dealing with domestic needs and problems the council said in a report issued at its annual convention here It is a situation that is considered likely to continue at least through this century with demands increasing and opposition to tax increases remaining strong The council is primarily a research organization that keeps track of what is going on in the 50 states It does not lobby allowing it some detachment its members are elected state officials at all levels about 500 of whom are attending the convention at Lake Tahoe Silent Revolution Robb Says Gov Charles S Robb of Virginia president of the council said in releasing the report A silent revolution is under way in American government due to the nations Federal budget deficit By the end of the century if not before it is not farfetched to project that the Federal Government will be responsible for national defense the national debt Social Security and income maintenance programs and little else The 97page report prepared by the council staff details what the states have been doing and the choices they face in 16 policy areas Over all from the states point of view there has been paralysis at the Federal level over the past few years the report says It goes on As the nation became caught up in debates on overriding moral issues and principles such as school prayer abortion who should pay for the deficit and where should the necessary budget cuts come from the Federal Government has spent less time legislating and more time discussing the issues and arbitrating disputes At the same time that the Federal Government is losing its ability to grapple with everyday issues people are becoming more involved and active in the political and governmental process But the researchers added that peoples demands had shifted from the Federal to the state and local arenas Duel Over Centralizing Because of Federal budget cuts cities and counties which had been looking more and more to Washington for direct aid are now exerting pressure on the states for more funds and more freedom to run their governments as they wish But the report asserts that while this decentralization has been occurring at a rapid rate Federal court rulings have been moving in the opposite direction toward more central control The report cites as examples Federal court approval of Federal mandates in setting truck weights a minimum drinking age and levels of pay for state and local civil servants areas the states had contended was constitutionally theirs to regulate The report said the new mandates were not accompanied by the funds necessary to carry them out Caught in a fiscal vise by increased demands from all sides states nevertheless are steering a conservative course the report saidadding On a national average basis spending is increasing at a rate of about 6 percent a year Through the increase of revenue and through economies reforms and new innovations the council said the states are expanding their activities and expenditures particularly in education agriculture rural development eco nomic development criminal justice and housing Of Reagan and Roosevelt One chapter on political realignment reflecting the views of both the council staff and Governor Robb says that even though Republicans have had extraordinary success on the national level in recent years there has been a political realignment under President Reagan of the kind that occurred to the benefit of Democrats under Franklin D Roosevelt Governor Robb is serving his last weeks of a fouryear term and is considered a probable candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 A major reason for the realignment the report said was that real decisionmaking is now taking place at the state level and that is the arena that state Democrats not the Republicans have been able to retain The political system it went on is driven not by the political parties but by the singleissue interest groups that have yet to be brought into a broad coalition of the kind seen under Roosevelt Southerners Ask 12State Primary In another development the executive committee of the Southern Legislative Conference meeting concurrently with the council voted Wednesday night to support a 12state regional Presidential primary election on the second Tuesday of March 1988 The idea of one primary in the South has been gaining support among Southern officials in an effort to strengthen the regions hand in the process of selecting delegates and to make all Presidential candidates conduct early and sustained campaigns in the South In 1982 the Southern legislative conferees called for a regional primary but found there was insufficient time to undertake the necessary planning and implementation for the 1984 campaign the executive committee said The plan is said to have the support of most governors and legislators in the 12state region

THE BARREN LANDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/books/the-barren-lands.html,THE FEAR OF POPULATION DECLINE By Michael S Teitelbaum and Jay M Winter 201 pp San Diego Academic Press Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Cloth 34 Paper 1995 FOR many years now public attention  and debate  concerning the worlds population problem has largely focused on overpopulation Demographers and pundits note that the worlds population is still rising at an unacceptably high rate of about 175 percent a year or an increase by the year 2000 from 49 billion to 62 billion This means that sometime early in the next century the world will contain some 9 billion people And more than threequarters of them will be packed into the economically struggling states of the third world which can least afford high population growth But overpopulation is not a problem for most of the industrialized West or for the Socialist states of Eastern Europe These countries have been experiencing a flattening out of the postwar baby boom many of them are now undergoing a net population decline as couples have fewer or no children and as their populations age In The Fear of Population Decline Michael S Teitelbaum who is a demographer and program officer at the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and Jay M Winter a social historian at Cambridge University point out the growing concern in these countries about population decline they also reveal how some countries  again especially in Eastern Europe  have started ambitious programs to thicken their populations a sharp contrast to the sometimes Draconian measures adopted by some third world countries to lower their birth rates The measures being adopted to promote population growth include banning contraception andor abortion In some countries bigger populations are seen as a sign of national strength in other countries oncedominant ethnic groups want to reassert their numerical superiority Mr Teitelbaum and Mr Winter reflect in their book on the modern history of concern about population decline Without offering advice they examine the implications of pronatalist policies I only wish the authors had told us a little more of what they personally think about these policy responses to population decline Moreover The Fear of Population Decline is a very readable work that should appeal to laymen and scholars alike This in itself is a formidable achievement for population studies is a field freighted with jargonridden tomes And because the authors illustrate how certain countries are taking steps to increase their populations this book has the added value of being topical They discuss the population explosion in the third world and trends in international migration they examine the proabortion and the righttolife movements in the United States and elsewhere and they dissect the political and ideological bases for promoting population growth One of the best chapters concerns the baby boom the resurgence of fertility in the West after World War II W E learn how largely white societies in Western Europe fear the immigrant invasion from places like Moslem Turkey and Algeria They tell us how Israel concerned over the much higher birth rate among Israeli Arabs than among Israeli Jews has promoted a national policy that is pronatalist in intent They also tell how some Arab nationalists are encouraging high fertility among the Arab population as a means of establishing eventual predominance over the JewishIsraeli population We learn about fears in the Soviet Union over the decline of fertility among white Russians and the increase in the population of the nonEuropean and Moslem peoples of the Central Asian Republics And we learn about the debate in Britain over the question of allowing the immigration of black and brown residents of former colonial territories The authors do not pass judgment on attitudes about population decline and the measures being adopted to reverse the trend But they do say that caution and patience must govern policy responses to fertility trends Implicit in this study is the hope that leaders of countries facing population declines will not rush into pushing policies that they  or their successors might one day rue Although most of the countries facing such a decline now have the resources to absorb accelerated population growth who is to say that todays underpopulation wont be tomorrows overpopulation
POTTER STEWART IS DEAD AT 70; WAS ON HIGH COURT 23 YEARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/us/potter-stewart-is-dead-at-70-was-on-high-court-23-years.html,Potter Stewart an Eisenhower Republican from Ohio who spent 23 years on the Supreme Court died yesterday in a hospital in Hanover NH where he had been admitted after suffering a stroke He was 70 years old Milner E Noble a spokesman for the DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center said Associate Justice Stewart died at 320 PM He had been in critical condition since being admitted to the medical center Monday the spokesman said For half of his time on the Court Justice Stewart was a conservative often dissenting member of the Warren Court for the other half he was at the decisive center of the more conservative Burger Court He preferred a pithy phrase to a long philosophical opinion He spoke of common sense approaches to problems that sharply split the Court and the country along ideological lines Modesty and intense loyalty to the institution prevented him from seeking to lead the Court from within and even prompted him to ask a President not to consider him for Chief Justice I Know It When I See It As he lamented publicly when he retired in June 1981 Justice Stewarts epitaph could have been his phrase from a 1964 obscenity case I know it when I see it For admitting that he could identify but not define hardcore pornography he was criticized as unjudicial but praised for candor Only a few years later he began arguing that judges should stay out of obscenity cases altogether except when the obscenity was blatant or pandered to children It was not the only time Justice Stewart made a short quotable remark Dissenting in 1966 from what he called a rigid simplistic enforcement of antitrust laws to halt a business merger he complained that the decisions only consistency with precedent was that the Government always wins In 1972 he explained his vote to strike down state death penalty laws by saying These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual When the Court in 1973 ruled that a debtor could be denied access to the bankruptcy court for want of a 50 filing fee he quipped The Court today holds that Congress may say that some of the poor are too poor even to go bankrupt I cannot agree Justice Stewart wrote or joined in many decisions upholding the First Amendment claims of reporters and news organizations but he also wrote the Court opinion rejecting press rights of access to prisons or pretrial court proceedings On civil rights issues he followed the Courts school desegregation rulings until he regarded some busing orders as excessive In a dramatic departure from middleoftheroad positions he delivered the Courts 1968 opinion reviving a Reconstructionera law against discrimination in real estate sales and other private transactions He voted for stronger enforcement of fair employement statues but argued for colorblind interpretations when he saw affirmative action programs leading to racial quotas Mr Stewart had a checkered record on issues of womens rights He struck down a Virginia law requiring excessive unpaid maternity leave for teachers but upheld state employee disability plans that excluded maternity benefits He voted reluctantly to concur in the Courts 1973 decision striking down state laws prohibiting abortion but wrote the Courts majority opinion upholding the power of Congress to bar Medicaid payments for abortions Regarding the rights of criminal suspects Justice Stewart usually cast his vote on the side supported by the police and prosecutors dissenting in such cases as the 1966 Miranda v Arizona ruling setting strict guidelines for confessions But when he saw a police intrusion between a defendant and his attorney as in Massiah v United States in 1963 he voted to throw out evidence obtained in violation of the right to counsel Despite his disagreements with many Warren Court decisions Mr Stewart resisted later attempts to overturn them preferring to limit those rulings He vigorously dissented in 1974 from an apparent overturning of a twoyearold decision when the only perceivable change that has occurred is in the makeup of this Court Two years later he withdrew that charge of Court politicization in a case that he said showed his fears had been exaggerated Influential Cincinnati Family Potter Stewart was a member of an influential Cincinnati family He was born on Jan 23 1915 in Jackson Mich where his parents had been vacationing His father a Cincinnati lawyer served nine years as the citys Mayor and later became a judge on the Ohio Supreme Court Potter earned academic scholarships to preparatory school and college a Phi Beta Kappa key and cum laude degrees from college and law school He was a graduate of the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville Conn Yale College and after a year of international law study at Cambridge University in England Yale Law School He spent two college summers on a Cincinnati newspaper and was chairman of The Yale Daily News but the only interruption on his path to a law career was service in World War II as a naval lieutenant aboard oil tankers Mr Stewart practiced law in New York briefly before and after World War II He returned to Cincinnati in 1947 joined a leading law firm and pursued an interest in politics He served two terms on the City Council and was the citys vice mayor for two years Senator Robert A Taft Jr was a family friend but Mr Stewart leaned toward Dwight D Eisenhower for the 1952 Republican Presidential nomination Became Youngest Federal Judge When President Eisenhower named him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 1954 Mr Stewart was 39 years old the youngest Federal judge in the country Perhaps his most famous circuit court opinion was issued just two weeks before his Supreme Court appointment in 1958 from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York where he sat briefly as a visiting judge The case grew out of a libel suit by Judy Garland the singer against Marie Torre television columnist for The New York Herald Tribune Judge Stewart held that whatever First Amendment right the columnist might have to preserve the confidentiality of her sources she was required to divulge the source of defamatory remarks about Miss Garland that apppeared in her column or serve a jail sentence for contempt of court Miss Torre went to jail On Court Before Confirmation After the retirement of Associate Justice Harold H Burton President Eisenhower appointed Judge Stewart during a Congressional recess in October 1958 permitting him to join the Court before the Senate confirmed him the following May At 43 he was the second youngest appointee since before the Civil War William O Douglas was 40 when he was appointed in 1939 The Court that Justice Stewart joined was closely divided on many of its most important questions which often gave the junior member the deciding vote in his first few years Although his vote was often sought by either side he rarely indulged in internal lobbying for the votes of others He also established early the practice of deciding most cases on the narrowest grounds with a minimum of judicial philosophizing He spoke of labels like liberal and conservative as fatuous and when asked to describe himself he said he thought of himself primarily as a lawyer One of his first major opinions for the Court a 5to4 decision in a case called Shelton v Tucker was important to constitutional law but somewhat limited in scope He ruled that an Arkansas law requiring public school teachers to list every association or group membership violated the First Amendment It was one of a series of decisions laying down the principle that even when Government is entitled to information it must proceed carefully and no more intrusively than necessary when freedom of speech press religion and association are involved Resisted Officiousness Another Stewart theme was resistance to Government officiousness and the tendency of the police and officials to bother people with divergent beliefs or ways of life In 1961 he dissented when the Court upheld a Sunday closing law in Pennsylvania saying it forced an Orthodox Jew who wanted to observe his Sabbath and do business on Sunday to choose between his religious faith and his economic survival That is a cruel choice he wrote For me this is not something that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of forced Sunday togetherness Justice Stewart was the lone dissenter when the Court struck down compulsory prayer recitations and Biblereading in public schools as an unconstitutional establishment of religion He argued that the state also had a right to support individuals in their constitutional right to free exercise of religion He said later that he was embarrassed by the flood of fan mail he received from writers who assumed he was expressing deep religious conviction rather than his view of the Constitution He warned that government by big brother was near when the Court in Ginzburg v United States in 1966 upheld an obscenity conviction out of what he called personal distaste for the defendants sordid business of hawking sexy magazines No Power to Pick or Choose He argued in dissent The First Amendment protects us all with an even hand It applies to Ralph Ginzburg with no less completeness and force than to G P Putnams Sons Putnams was the publisher whose right to distribute the novel Fanny Hill was upheld the same day When the loitering ordinance of his hometown of Cincinnati came before the Court in 1971 Justice Stewart objected to its loose language forbidding conduct that was annoying to others He struck it down as a violation of both due process and the right of peaceable assembly In OConnor v Donaldson a major 1975 mental health case Justice Stewart held that states may not confine the insane involuntarily if they are not dangerous and can live safely out of institutions Defendant May Represent Himself A week after that decision the Justice delivered the Courts opinion in Farretta v California saying the state does not always know best when a defendant wants to represent himself without a lawyer If the accused is mentally competent and willing to take the risk courts should not stop him To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him he wrote In civil rights Mr Stewart delivered two opinions with different results growing out of the same 1963 demonstrations in Birmingham Ala He ruled in 1967 that even if the citys paradepermit ordinance was unconstitutional the demonstrators could not violate a court injunction enforcing it In 1969 he ruled that the same ordinance properly tested on review of convictions for violating it was unconstitutional The Courts clear message test laws in an orderly way without defying courts and you have a chance of winning His most farreaching civil rights decision came in the 1968 case of Jones v Mayer Co involving a lawsuit by a black St Louis man who was rebuffed when he tried to buy a suburban home A law giving blacks new property rights after the Civil War had lain dormant because of 19thcentury Supreme Court decisions that Justice Stewart said were based on an overly restrictive reading of the Constitution Revived the law was a more sweeping ban on private housing discrimination than Congress was able to pass a century later Proud of the Opinion Justice Stewart was asked by the librarian of Hofstra Law School to name his favorite case He cited Rideau v Louisiana but did not elaborate That was a 1963 opinion reversing a murder conviction because jurors had been influenced by television broadcasts of the defendant confessing to the sheriff Justice Stewart was part of the sixmember majority in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case that ruled out court injunctions against publication of the Defense Departments secret history of the origins of the Vietnam War Although the Justices opinions split in many directions his opinion joined by Justice White expressed the prevailing view that only material that would certainly cause direct immediate and irreparable damage to the nation or its people could be restrained by courts before publication He summarized the state of First Amendment law in a candid address at the Yale Law School in 1974 So far as the Constitution goes he said the autonomous press may publish what it knows and may seek to learn what it can There is no constitutional right to have access to particular government information or to require openness from the bureaucracy The Constitution itself is neither a freedom of information act nor an official secrets act The Constitution in other words establishes the contest not its resolution Rulings on Womens Rights Justice Stewart sought but rarely found a middle ground on issues raised by womens rights organizations His opinions on contraception and abortion disclosed strong personal views against restrictive state laws he called Connecticuts contraceptive statute uncommonly silly  but an inability to find a constitutional basis for striking them down His concurring opinion in the Roe v Wade abortion decision in 1973 called on his colleagues to acknowledge the revival of socalled substantive due process  a lawyers term for judges substituting their personal values for those of the legislature His reservations persisted throughout his Court service He cast the deciding vote and delivered the 1980 opinion in Harris v McRae that legislatures need not include abortion funding in medical benefits In criminal law Justice Stewarts 1972 vote against capital punishment laws was based on what he considered unequal application of the death penalty In 1976 he voted with two other centrist Justices Lewis F Powell Jr and John Paul Stevens to control the results of five major test cases With the Courts other members holding firm views totally for or against five newly reenacted death penalty laws the centrist justices voted to uphold Georgia Florida and Texas laws while striking down mandatory execution laws in North Carolina and Louisiana Sought Narrowest Grounds Justice Stewarts quest for the narrowest possible grounds for decision was exemplified in 1961 when he ruled that the police had violated the Fourth Amendment by driving a wired spike mike through the wall of a Washington townhouse to overhear conversations of gamblers next door Urged to abandon privacy concepts that depended on whether the police physically trespassed on the suspects private property Mr Stewart said the case could be decided by adhering to the traditional dividing line adding But we decline to go beyond it by even a fraction of an inch Six years later he cited that decision as part of the eroding of old privacy doctrines overruled two precedents and declared in Katz v United States that a microphone placed against an outside wall could be an invasion of privacy As usual he summed it up in a phrase The Constitution protects people not places Justice Stewart was outspoken in the courtroom asking pointed questions of lawyers during arguments After many other justices had abandoned the practice he delivered entire majority opinions or dissents orally from the bench when he considered them important A Secret Call on Nixon In 1969 he took a dramatic step to insure that he would not be named Chief Justice Amid press speculation that he might be elevated to replace the retiring Earl Warren he made a secret call on President Nixon He told the President that history had taught that it was unwise to promote Associate Justices and that it was prudent to name a Chief Justice from outside the Court Some historians have disputed Justice Stewarts contention but he feared strained internal relationships at the Court After Mr Nixon disclosed the meeting Justice Stewart explained that he had spoken to the President in part to put aside any personal ambition he might harbor keeping a promise to himself not to seek any higher office once he had reached the Court Justice Stewart recalled that after his White House visit I felt better than I had felt in a long time His retirement at age 66  only Justices Sherman Minton and Charles E Whittaker retired at younger ages was a surprise when it was announced just before the close of a Court term in 1981 Any of five older Justices could have been expected to retire sooner Justice Stewart explained that he had been thinking of quitting  but taking on special assignments on lower courts  soon after he became eligible the previous year but that he had put off retiring to avoid an electionyear confirmation fight over his successor Justice Stewart became better known to many Americans in his retirement when he appeared with Fred W Friendly in a public broadcasting series on the Constitution Justice Stewart is survived by his wife Mary Anne three children Potter David and Harriet Virkstis a sister Irene Bernard a brother Zeph and six grandchildren Praise for Stewart WASHINGTON Dec 7 AP  Justice Stewart was mourned today as a patriot and a good lawyer  indeed a brilliant man of the law by President Reagan who said the Justice had lived a magnificent life Chief Justice Warren E Burger said in a statement issued by the Court that the death removes a splendid jurist from the bench For more than two decades Justice Stewart gave dedicated and distinguished service to our country he said Vice President Bush called Justice Stewart an outstanding man who was a symbol of decency and honor He was a constitutional scholar who interpreted the Constitution without succumbing to the temptation to legislate from the bench Mr Bush said
New Agenda for the Women's Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/magazine/l-new-agenda-for-the-women-s-movement-206876.html,A feminist at least as I perceive it is a person who advocates the same rights for women as for men As a father with hopes for his daughter and as a husband of a professional woman I realize that women still face obstacles that men do not I do insist however that my definition of feminism is exhaustive if we are serious in talking about a womens movement Far from providing an umbrella for all women Mrs Friedans article offers a platform only for women and men who embrace the philosophy of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party In short Mrs Friedans umbrella seems to exclude feminists as I have used the term who regard themselves as conservative Republicans or even conservative Democrats It excludes many of the majority of voting women who voted for President Reagan It excludes those women who believe that abortion is not a right of women but rather a moral wrong of the highest order It excludes women who though dedicated to equal pay for equal work regard comparable worth as a blueprint for both economic catastrophe and the demise of free enterprise The womens movement will start moving again only when it escapes the bondage of its liberal baggage and strives to unite both conservatives and liberals in the important but limited fight against a common enemy the remaining barriers to true equality between women and men JOSEPH D GRANO Detroit
SENATOR SAYS REPORT CLEARS SAFETY NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/us/senator-says-report-clears-safety-nominee.html,John C Danforth chairman of the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee has issued a report saying he is satisfied with Terrence M Scanlons denials of charges that he misused his office on the Consumer Product Safety Commission Senator Danforth said an investigation did not support the allegations and he expressed his hope that the Senate would act soon on Mr Scanlons nomination to be chairman of the agency The nomination of Mr Scanlon now the acting chairman was held up after Joan Claybrook who heads the consumer organization Public Citizen said that he had used the commissions staff and facilities for antiabortion and personal activities and had dealt improperly with companies under investigation by the commission Senator Danforth a Republican from Missouri said in a statement Friday evening that an inquiry by the General Accounting Office a Congressional investigative agency could not find any substantiation on virtually all the charges Miss Claybrook on the other hand after reading the agencys report said today that the charges had indeed been substantiated and she asserted that Mr Scanlon had lied to investigators Mr Scanlon said the report vindicated him and he said he had not lied Senator Danforth after reviewing the accounting office findings and interviewing a commission employee who had refused to be questioned by the Congressional investigators said I do not believe there exists a systematic or abusive pattern of inappropriate use of staff and facilities An example of the differing views came in the finding on whether Mr Scanlon had used commission staff and facilities In his interviews with investigators Mr Scanlon said at first that he had never done so He later acknowledged that he had saying today that he had forgotten the instances because they were so infrequent and did not occur recently Miss Claybrook said that they showed Mr Scanlon had lied under oath and therefore should not be confirmed Senator Danforth gave this summary There were nine incidents of Xeroxing 11 incidents of typed letters relating to church matters 15 typed letters relating to personal or private business eg personal finances investments health insurance schools etc six letters to the editor six errands performed eg bank deposit notes requesting specific information etc three typed letters to other government officials one letter on DC Right to Life Committee stationery Miss Claybrook said this showed that on at least 51 instances he misused Government facilities and staff for private purposes including personal business and right to life activities ConflictofInterest Charge The General Accounting Office investigated Miss Claybrooks assertion that Mr Scanlons activities in antiabortion organizations had created a conflict of interest The accounting offices finding was this Our investigation did not reveal any instances in which Mr Scanlons membership in various right to life organizations created a real or apparent conflict of interest The report also said it found no evidence to support the allegation that Mr Scanlon had improperly met with and given information to companies that dealt with the safety commission Mr Scanlon speaking of the secretarial aide who performed the duties in question said I had her Xerox nine things over a threeyear period She kept anything that she thought was not germane to the commission Mr Scanlon said he did not know why this employee had kept copies of such material Senator Danforth who interviewed the employee said I am satisfied with Mr Scanlons response It is therefore my hope that the committee can consider Mr Scanlons nomination before the Senate adjourns for 1985 Miss Claybrook said she would use the findings to urge the committee to refuse to approve the nomination
ABORTION CLINICS ARE TARGETS AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/09/us/abortion-clinics-are-targets-again.html,Violence against abortion clinics widely thought to have abated this year after the conviction of bombers in the Washington area and in Pensacola Fla has intensified recently And the latest incidents appear to be the first in which the target was human life A package sent to the Feminist Womens Health Center in Portland Ore last week was found to contain a bomb designed to explode on opening A search by the postal authorities there turned up three more explosive devices in the mail waiting to be delivered to two other clinics and a Planned Parenthood office Previous bombings and burnings of clinics have generally occurred after business hours and abortionrights activists regard the introduction of package bombs as a dangerous escalation in antiabortion activity This is really the first time that its clear that the intent is to kill people said Nanette Falkenberg the executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League in Washington and that intent is to kill people who work in the clinics Link to Senate Campaign Sgt Jay Decker of the Portland police confirmed that the bombs which he said were of an incendiary nature had that potential Oh they could kill he said Theyre definitely set to injure or maim the person who opens the package and probably everybody nearby We think Oregon is going to be a focal point of these organizations because of the Packwood campaign Sergeant Decker said Bob Packwood a Republican who is a leading supporter of a womans right to choose abortion is seeking a fourth term in the United States Senate next year Hes defintely prochoice the officer said and all the prolife people are trying to defeat him Etta Fielek a spokesman for the Senator said the campaign had been singled out by antiabortion groups noting that one the ProLife Amendment Political Action Committee has moved its head office from the nations capital to Medford Ore Mr Packwood who faces a Baptist minister opposed to abortion in the Republican primary said in a television interview Friday that the bombs were clearly meant to kill dismember or maim and he condemned the action as an example of people taking the law into their own hands Incidents in Other States The Postal Service has offered a 10000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the bombing attempts in Portland which followed three arsons in Louisiana and North Carolina in late October The River City Womans Clinic in Baton Rouge was destroyed by fire the night of Oct 27 two days after a fire at the Hallmark Clinic in Charlotte caused 75000 in damage Then at 3 AM on Oct 30 a fire damaged the Delta Womens Clinic West in Baton Rouge The rate of bombings and burnings last year mushroomed as the Christmas season approached and Barbara Radford who heads the National Abortion Federation in Washington said I think it has escalated again But weve had violence all year she noted Arsons are down but death threats against doctors are up And there has been lots of vandalism of gunshots fired through windows Previous Attempts on Clinics At least two of the Oregon clinics to which the package bombs were addressed had been targets of arsonists or bombers before One was addressed to Dr Peter Bours a Forest Grove physician who performs abortions and has been the subject of written death threats and two arson attempts but postal inspectors found and defused the package bomb Tuesday before it could be delivered to him I could easily have opened that package without thinking about it Dr Bours said Friday linking the bombing attempt to the inflammatory rhetoric of the antiabortion activists who have picketed his clinic for more than two years If you call a person a murderer or a killer enough times Dr Bours said somebody else of your ilk is going to take matters in hand and go after him The Lovejoy Surgical Center also a target of the package bombs was the object of a crude fireombing attempt in August Sergeant Decker said A Planned Parenthood office in the Portland area to which the fourth package bomb was addressed does not even perform abortions Staff Had Been Warned A receptionist at the Feminist Womens Health Center became suspicious of the package containing the bomb on Monday because workers there had been given information by the local police and by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms on the telltale signs such packages sometimes bear according to Amy Aycrigg of the clinic staff It is fortunate that the first package did come to us she said because we were aware and were able to spot it and in turn we have saved lives Stones have been thrown through the windows of the center which is regularly picketed and its electrical system has been sabotaged and the telephone lines cut according to Miss Aycrigg who said it would not cease performing abortions We will not permit

The Family-Planning Ploy,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/12/opinion/the-family-planning-ploy.html,The spirit of the KempHatch amendment opposing Congressional funding of family planning services reveals the conservative alliances ultimate strategy Although defeated in committee by a substitute bill that must still pass the House  KempHatch could be revived  its ban on Federal funds for any family planning clinic that offers abortion counseling shows the aim of the Fundamentalists Roman Catholic conservatives and President Reagan They wish to attack birth control and voluntary sterilization the foundation of a womans right to control her childbearing Their eventual target is to wipe out the womens movement Such measures strike at the poor particularly teenagers who could lose their access to contraception and counseling if Federal funds are cut at clinics An even bigger casualty could be state health departments and hospitals which together get about 55 percent of their money from Washington The irony of this strategy is that if the alliance was serious about diminishing the number of abortions it would be fostering birth control and sex education programs Yet the Vatican keeps hammering against birth control In America where National Opinion Research Center studies showed that 90 percent of Catholics no longer considered birth control a sin and used it as much as other faiths the hierarchy tries to block innovative programs When 300 of 1000 students became pregnant last year a Chicago high school established a medical clinic with the aid of a hospital and a state grant Joseph Cardinal Bernardin lambasted the clinic for promoting a contraceptive culture and cheap solutions The Kansas City Kan archdiocese uses punishment It stigmatizes pregnant students by dismissing them from parochial school and allows them to return only after they have given up the baby for adoption and convinced the principal of their fitness Although a poll showed that 75 percent of the public and 86 percent of teachers thought sex education should be part of the school curriculum Catholic and Fundamentalist schools have moved timidly A New York City program has been locked in debate for years RighttoLife pressure made Suffolk County NY with the states highest teenage pregnancy rate reject funds that would have provided two nurses for school counseling Christianity Today a Fundamentalist journal reports that only six evangelical schools had courses in sexuality in 1983 Voluntary sterilization the No 1 method of birth control for Catholics and Americans in general has become a particular Vatican target Despite the conflict with Catholic dogma a 1979 study showed that 20 percent of Catholic hospitals performed sterilizations 47 percent of Catholic hospital staffs reported they wanted to perform them But the Vatican cracked down and ordered the Sisters of Mercy hospitals system largest nongovernmental supplier of medical services in the country to halt all sterilizations The conservative alliance has come up with no longrange solutions of its own It produced the Adolescent Family Life Act whose main emphasis is on promoting chastity The only birth control taught is the rhythm method which has a notorious failure rate Implementation of the act has raised serious issues of churchstate separation being challenged in court for Federal money under the act has been focused almost entirely on teaching Catholic and Fundamentalist dogma All but two of 80 programs in Massachusetts for example are taught at Catholic schools Whether or not opponents succeed in chopping away at Federal money for family planning the broader threat of the conservative alliance must be recognized It has damaged the funding of International Planned Parenthood and the United Nationss Fund for Population Activities It harangues against contraceptive culture but its real fear is further equality for women In the long run almost every plank in the womens movement depends upon a womans control of her childbearing The danger of the rightwing alliances attacks is not just a loss of dollars but the erosion of the womens movement itself
CONSUMERS' AIDE BACKED IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/us/consumers-aide-backed-in-senate.html,The Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation voted 9 to 7 today to approve the nomination of Terrence M Scanlon as chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission The closeness of the vote resulted partly from the view of some senators that Mr Scanlon now acting chairman was not forthright when he told investigators in sworn statements that he had not used any commission staff members for his antiabortion church or personal activities Mr Scanlon acknowledged last week that he had done so but said that the incidents had been so minor that he had forgotten them Senator John C Danforth of Missouri a Republican who is chairman of the committee asked for approval of the nomination despite the conflict between Mr Scanlons statements My feeling is that this is not a criminal court but a committee of the Senate and we do not have sufficient information to block the nomination Senator Danforth said Ford Suggests Waiting Longer Senator Wendell H Ford a Kentucky Democrat suggested that the committee would be exercising prudence by withholding confirmation until the matter of the conflicting statements was settled There is something about this that makes me hesitant Senator Ford said The strongest criticism of Mr Scanlon came from Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon Mr Packwood a strong supporter of the right of women to decide whether to have abortions is in direct opposition to Mr Scanlon on the issue but he did not mention it other than to include antiabortion activities as those Mr Scanlon had used his staff for I dont think hes been forthright Senator Packwood said adding that he was not going to quarrel that no other Government official ever used a secretary for nongovernment work But he faulted Mr Scanlon for first denying it I dont think hes fit to be chairman Senator Packwood said Those voting for Mr Scanlon either in person or by proxy were Senator Danforth and these other Republicans Larry Pressler of South Dakota Slade Gordon of Washington Ted Stevens of Alaska Bob Kasten of Wisconsin Paul S Trible Jr of Virginia and Barry Goldwater of Arizona Democrats voting for the nomination were Daniel K Inouye of Hawaii and Donald W Riegel of Michigan Kassebaum Opposes Him Voting against were Mr Packwood and Nancy L Kassebaum Republican of Kansas and these Democrats Senator Ford Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina J James Exon of Nebraska Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee and John D Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia Joan Claybrook president of the consumer organization Public Citizen who had brought the charges of improper outside activities by Mr Scanlon to the committee said The closeness of the vote certainly shows there is a great deal of concern After Miss Claybrook made the charges and Mr Scanlon denied them a secretarial employee at the commission told Senators Danforth and Hollings of nongovernmental work performed for Mr Scanlon Senator Danforth summarized them last week There were nine incidents of Xeroxing 11 incidents of typed letters relating to church matters 15 typed letters relating to personal or private business eg personal finances investments health insurance schools etc six letters to the editor six errands performed eg bank deposit notes requesting specific information etc three typed letters to other government officials one letter on DC Right to Life Committee stationery
"Q&A: Dr. C. Everett Koop, Surgeon General;   Of Strong Prescriptions",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/us/q-a-dr-c-everett-koop-surgeon-general-of-strong-prescriptions.html,In voting to seek a ban on cigarette advertising this week the American Medical Association echoed a call made a year ago by Dr C Everett Koop the Surgeon General of the United States Dr Koop who said then that the goal of a smokefree nation could be reached by the year 2000 has campaigned against the dangers of smoking calling cigarettes the leading preventable cause of death in the country Perhaps 350000 people die each year from the effects of smoking he says In an interview Dr Koop now in his second term as the nations leading public health official commented on his strong positions on this and such other matters as abortion and the rights of severely handicapped infants Q Is a smokefree society a realistic goal A Yes if you understand that what I mean is not the complete absence of smoking but a society in which you will not find people smoking in the presence of people who dont want it A complete ban is not possible Q Your annual report on the health hazards of smoking is due Dec 19 What will it show The report will show a great difference in smoking between bluecollar and whitecollar workers Bluecollar workers smoke more and tend to start earlier At the work site they frequently cant smoke at a machine so they all take a break together and they are more likely to smoke together Q That doesnt explain why they start earlier in the first place A I wish I knew why they start earlier Because they start earlier their addiction is harder to break Q Addiction A I use the term carefully and thoughtfully Seventyeight percent of smokers wish they could quit There is no question that nicotine is addictive Ask the man or woman who tried to quit Q The American Medical Association has been criticized for its slowness in speaking out against smoking Are you heartened by its recent action A I have been delighted in the last few years to see the role of the younger members those in the leadership of the student and resident sections The AMAs actions are farreaching calling for a ban on advertising and also for insurance incentives for nonsmokers and for education Education should start with 8yearold kids not with teenagers I think there had been a dichotomy at the AMA Now it cuts across all groups Q Some at the AMA called for making cigarettes illegal Can they be prohibited A It wont work The prohibition of alcohol didnt work It has to be a grassroots and personal commitment The smoker today is well educated about the health hazards Now nonsmokers are aware of the dangers they face from others smoke and they are becoming more than annoyed They are becoming militant and that is a very powerful weapon The next area that I think is going to be the battleground is the worksite and the economic advantage to the employer which eventually will be a benefit to the employee Thats where the big battle will be and we expect to win it with the help of the employers and the assistance of the labor unions Q When you became Surgeon General you began with controversy over your views against abortion Has four years in office led you to modify your views A I havent changed my position I am opposed to it People who favor abortion saw my being here as a threat to them but there is absolutely nothing that I have to do about abortion Even if I did I have an obligation to uphold the law of the land Q What are your other concerns A The handicapped Because of the hightechnology successes weve had with infants weve saved more individuals They are now with us and they are here in large numbers so we have to make sure they are not shortchanged They have to be mainstreamed into society We have got to get the nonhandicapped to realize that if they can help the handicapped get ahead everyone will benefit Another problem is low birthweight babies and their health problems which can be prevented by encouraging young pregnant women to see a doctor eat a proper diet avoid drugs We have to find ways to get our message to teenagers which creates more problems than you would think As soon as it is suggested that there should be prenatal clinics in high schools and talk about it as a Federal issue the local authorities point out that they run the schools and question it If you take the program to the high school kid it is effective Q Dont some people object on the ground that this might encourage teenage promiscuity A I dont think it encourages teenaged promiscuity This is not sex education or birth control classes Once you have a teenager who is pregnant you have a public health problem Q What is another concern of yours A Violence is a public health issue Most people think of it as a criminal justice issue  apprehension and punishment  but we have to learn to prevent it Important aspects of it are child abuse child sexual abuse spouse abuse and parental abuse The newest problem on the horizon is abuse of the elderly It is almost always by a relative and then it spreads perhaps to an attendant in a nursing home who detects an attitude that abuse is OK The most likely abuser of a parent in a middleaged daughter She likely is abused by her husband abuses her children and was abused as a child herself So its a threegeneration problem The cycle has to be broken and the data suggest that there has been a decline Such a decline would be attributable to educational efforts and a reporting system that allows intervention and dealing with problems of abuse I am looking forward to a discussion of this with the Department of Justice and I hope we can combine our efforts Q Can you achieve all these goals A As Surgeon General you dont have the authority and you dont have the money The things that I do are based on moral suasion
FOREIGN AFFAIRS;   The Survival Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/opinion/foreign-affairs-the-survival-question.html,A Federal appeals court here has made a foreign policy decision on a technicality that highlights the peculiar means some conservatives are using to force their view of morality on the rest of the world The court ruled that the Agency for International Development may release 10 million to certain countries after the money was withdrawn from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Werner Fornos president of the Washingtonbased Population Institute had sued to freeze the money in an effort to restore it to the important UN agency All this legal wrangling is really about abortion and sterilization in countries struggling against explosive birth rates which menace not only their own hopes for the future but the fate of the world Specifically it is about the charge that China forces some people to undergo these operations or offers financial incentives Evidence that China does so was not even offered but the Administration position was that it is up to China to prove it has punished anybody who has forced such an abuse on its citizens Nor is there evidence that the Administration really wants to poke into Chinas onefamily onechild program or its legal system A remarkable letter from President Reagan to Senator Jesse Helms dated Oct 6 explains the political tradeoff that Mr Helms extracted The Dear Jesse letter starts off saying how much the President wants confirmation of Winston Lord as US Ambassador to China Then it switches to a lengthy assurance that China will not get any American funds through the UN program to help its population control efforts Then it repeats the urgency of speeding Mr Lord to Peking where he has now taken up his assignment The connection isnt drawn explicitly but its perfectly obvious It is also obvious that by holding up dozens of diplomatic confirmations until he got his way and threatening to do it again Senator Helms has cowed the State Department into an embarrassing and counterproductive stand The 10 million China was receiving was a drop in the bucket compared with the 1 billion it spends to try to stabilize its population at the projected 13 billion by the year 2000 But it was an important symbol of US support for an excruciatingly difficult national effort and the prohibition was an insult It is ironic furthermore that the US wont take Chinas word on the population control measures that it uses but accepts more dubious assurances that China wont allow billions of US dollars in nuclear technology aid to seep out and thwart nuclear nonproliferation But it is even more hypocritical to cut off birth control support in the name of a USlegislated definition of morality in a world of spreading famine and strained resources This is a mouth race alongside the arms race because there is no way economic development can even keep up with unlimited demographic growth in most of the poor countries The choice is between natural population control that is Malthusian tragedy and human responsibility As Werner Fornos notes undermining the UN fund will make only a token difference to China But it will really hurt up to a hundred other countries that are just beginning to understand that ageold attitudes mean disaster in the worlds new circumstances The dominant official view in Africa had been that more people mean more power and the only way to catch up with betteroff countries is to outnumber them At present rates by the middle of the 21st century Nigeria will have the population that China has now and Kenya double the present US population There are many more factors in braking population growth than birth control  including education better health care better agricultural policies But there has to be recognition that how many people there are in the world and how they live are directly related Until about a century and a half ago the world population had been almost stable over two millennia The biblical injunction to reproduce was needed to assure human survival Now science has changed the survival question requiring human care to protect natures ability to support our numbers It is incredible that a privileged group in the US should presume to punish others trying to face this dilemma and in the name of morality Survival remains the issue though in different terms Mr Helmss dictated position is not only bad policy it is immoral in the most profound human sense
Politics;   Whither the Women's Movement?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/us/politics-whither-the-women-s-movement.html,Notwithstanding Geraldine A Ferraros announcement Wednesday that she will not seek a Senate seat from New York next year the womens political movement has entered its unremarkable phase activists say and that they add is real progress We have finally created an atmosphere where the election of a woman is unremarkable said Kathy Wilson a Republican who once headed the National Womens Political Caucus and remains active in the movement Moreover according to Mrs Wilson and others the movement has also reached the stage where it cannot be derailed by the fading of a superstar like Mrs Ferraro They cite the emergence of a new generation of Democratic women and the surge to prominence of such national figures as Jeanne J Kirkpatrick on the Republican side as harbingers of a bright future for women in both parties If 1984 was the year of Geraldine Ferraro 1985 was the year of Mary Sue Terry and 1986 could be the year of Harriett Woods Barbara A Mikulski and Jane Eskind Miss Terry the first woman chosen for statewide office in Virginia was elected Attorney General last month the leading votegetter on the Democratic ticket Mrs Woods now the Lieutenant Governor of Missouri is running for the United States Senate as is another Democrat Miss Mikulski in Maryland And in Tennessee Mrs Eskind is seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor Not the Same Level of Emotion and Drama Their names may not be as familiar as that of Mrs Ferraro and their races may not evoke the same level of emotion and drama as her historymaking Democratic VicePresidential candidacy in 1984 But their campaigns and those of women candidates for state and local office across the nation are just as important to the political progress of women according to many activists A few months ago when Maryland Republicans began a desperate search for a candidate to seek the Senate seat to be vacated by Charles McC Mathias Jr in 1986 they first approached Dr Kirkpatrick a convert to the Republican Party who was President Reagans chief delegate to the United Nations until earlier this year Dr Kirkpatrick turned them down and now she is being mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for Vice President in 1988 If that happens the discussion wont be about her being a woman and whether she can handle the job Mrs Wilson said One of the things Geraldine Ferraro did was to raise the tolerance threshold for women candidates Two women now serve in the United States Senate Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Paula Hawkins of Florida both Republicans Twentythree women serve in the House of Representatives Two women are Governors Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky and Madeleine M Kunin of Vermont both Democrats Five lieutenant governorships are held by women and since 1969 the number of women serving in state legislatures has tripled to nearly 15 percent of the total seats The Ferraro VicePresidential candidacy among other things appears to have ended the preoccupation of women political activists with making a breakthrough on a national party ticket These days they talk not as much about the makeup of the 1988 ticket of either national party as about strategies for electing more women to Congress governorships state legislatures and local offices Candidates for national office are going to come from women who hold other offices said Ann F Lewis national director of Americans for Democratic Action Thats why were talking about targeting being practical and setting our priorities It would be a mistake to measure our progress by whether or not there is a woman on the national ticket in 1988 In short she added the womens political movement is concentrating on the nuts and bolts of politics organizing fundraising polling political advertising and strategy Early campaign money is still the biggest single stumbling block facing women candidates said Miss Lewis a former political director of the Democratic National Committee Some say the womens political movement has grown more pragmatic as it has become less of a debating society and more active in the campaigns of women For example some national womens organizations withheld endorsement of candidates in this years elections in cases where they were told it could be politically damaging Instead they quietly offered money and other support to their choices Weve moved beyond the stage of beating up on each other for not hiring all female consultants Mrs Wilson said It would be a mistake to think the womens movement is dead just because were not behind the microphone bellowing about abortion and the equal rights amendment Some might even think it ironic that Republicans are mentioning Dr Kirkpatrick and Elizabeth Hanford Dole the Secretary of Transportation as possible VicePresidential nominees in 1988 while Democrats whose party platform is much closer to the political agenda of women activists are talking about the necessity of having a Southerner on their national ticket But that does not mean that all Republican women are happy with their party At this weeks meeting of the Republican Governors Association in Wilmington Del Susan Farmer the Secretary of State in Rhode Island chided her party for not doing more to involve women who make up the majority of the electorate Women will vote for our women candidates but wont associate themselves with the Republican Party she told the Governors We need to bring in more women as active participants
THE NATION;   BUSH FORGIVES AN OLD TORMENTOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/weekinreview/the-nation-bush-forgives-an-old-tormentor.html,No one was meaner to George Bush in his 1980 campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination than William Loeb the conservative publisher of The Manchester Union Leader in New Hampshire Mr Loeb who died in 1981 called Mr Bush a hypocrite and a spoonfed little rich kid among other things But politicians who cannot learn to forgive are often forgotten and Vice President Bush wants to be remembered in 1988 his strategists say for his loyalty to Reaganstyle conservatism Last week he gave the keynote speech at a testimonial in Washington for his late political tormentor telling the audience of several hundred influential Republican conservatives that Mr Loebs barbs were to be expected in the rough and tumble of politics According to his strategists Mr Bush is moving aggressively to build support among conservative groups lest they be lost to prospective opponents for the 1988 Presidential nomination Mr Bush has acknowledged changing his views on some issues such as abortion to positions more closely aligned with the Presidents That has won him gratitude in the White House At the dinner Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff introduced the Vice President as the most loyal and most effective of all Ronald Reagan supporters Paul G Kirk Jr Democratic national chairman called Mr Bushs strategy good news for Democrats
YEARS OF REPUBLICAN FRUSTRATION UNDERLAY HOUSE REVOLT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/us/years-of-republican-frustration-underlay-house-revolt.html,President Reagans startling setback on a tax vote in the House of Representatives this week resulted from Republican legislators mounting frustration at being treated like extras in the political theater and from a lack of political leadership in the White House according to lawmakers Administration officials and political analysts It was a combination of things that just all came to a head said Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip whose job is usually to round up support for the Presidents positions Many say reverberations from the vote Wednesday to block House consideration of legislation on tax revision will be felt for the rest of Mr Reagans Presidency even if he is ultimately able to switch enough Republican votes to salvage the bill Trip to Capitol Hill Planned The White House said today that Mr Reagan and his aides would telephone lawmakers over the weekend to try to round up support for the tax measure and that the President would make an unusual trip to Capitol Hill Monday afternoon to address a meeting of Republican members of the House Mr Reagan who has called tax revision the top legislative priority of his second term devoted the first few sentences of his radio address today to an appeal to the House to approve the tax bill He did not mention that the legislation was balked by the almost solid opposition of Republicans or that he had been backed by a 3to1 majority of Democrats He merely called for bipartisan support of his position This is one time politics must be put aside on both sides of the aisle he declared The Republican defiance of the President was emphasized however by Representative Robert T Matsui of California who delivered the Democratic response to the Presidents address The sad fact is he said that many Republicans dont want tax reform Republican legislators will not be swayed easily By voting in an almost solid bloc against a procedural resolution that would have allowed the tax measure to be considered they said they sent a signal that they were a political force to be reckoned with This was not a vote against Ronald Reagan or tax reform said a key strategist for the House Republican leadership It was a vote against a process that Republicans were shut out of I would expect this is a lesson that will be remembered for years to come Norman J Ornstein a political scientist who specializes in the study of Congress said that for a long time there has been a simmering sense among House Republicans that they are orphans of the political process maltreated by the Democratic majority and neglected and taken for granted by the White House The Republicans frustration is grounded in their status as what seems to be a permanent minority No current Republican Representative has ever been in the majority the party has not controlled the House since 1954 Republicans now hold 182 seats to the Democrats 253 and they expect to lose seats in the midterm elections next year Division Among Themselves On important committees like Ways and Means which wrote the taxrevising legislation their minority is nearly 1 to 2 and they hold only 4 of the 13 spots on the Rules Committee Even among themselves the Republicans are fractured Most are often characterized as Main Street Republicans lawmakers whose social and economic views are identified with those of prosperous business people But increasingly in recent years young Republicans have been elected who espouse supplyside economics religious fundamentalism and social conservatism on such issues as abortion and family life Given their minority status and the division in their own ranks the Repubicans have regularly been ignored by the White House and bullied by the Democratic majority Republican lawmakers complain that Mr Reagan has barely consulted with them on such important issues as budget cuts and foreign policy preferring to deal with the Republicancontrolled Senate and whatever Democratic allies he can find in the House In their relations with Democratic legislators the Republicans say they are still galled by the majoritys tactics last spring in awarding a seat in a disputed House race in Indiana to the Democrat Frank McCloskey A Focus for Frustrations All these frustrations became embodied in the tax legislation The bill was written in the Treasury Department and the White House without consultation with Republican lawmakers It was reworked in the Ways and Means Committee by the chairman Representative Dan Rostenkowski Democrat of Illinois working hand in hand with Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d When the bill went before the Rules Committee Tuesday for a resolution or rule that established which amendments would be in order every Republican proposal was rejected on a partyline vote Even so as late as Tuesday night the Republicans had no intention of trying to defeat the rule and thus block consideration of the legislation But Wednesday morning according to Republican leaders they sensed that enough Democrats wanted to offer amendments prohibited by the rule that they might have a chance to mount a sneak attack and cause the rule to be rejected Their position was reinforced by a statement on a morning television show by Bob Packwood of Oregan the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that the Senate would make few changes next year in the House bill One of the Presidents main arguments has been that any problems in the House bill can be corrected in the Senate LastMinute Strategy Less than an hour before the vote on the rule about 35 Republicans met in Mr Lotts office in the Capitol and quickly plotted strategy Calls were made to all Republican lawmakers saying it was the position of the partys House leadership to vote against the rule Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York who attended the meeting said 50 to 75 votes might have been swayed against the President by the Packwood statement The Democrats treated the rule routinely like nearly all other rules and only a handful were on the floor when Mr Lott asked for recognition and speaking extemporaneously made an almost Delphic statement How many of you in your secret heart of hearts wish that this issue would just go away he asked A few Republicans murmured assent I have a feeling the spirit is being moved he said his arms upraised Normally the whip of the Presidents party informs the White House of a sudden development on the floor Asked after the vote whether he had warned the White House this time Mr Lott smiled and said I would ordinarily have warned them but I havent been talking to them much in the last couple of days The defeat of the rule by a vote of 223 to 202 with only 14 Republicans voting to back the Presidents position and 164 voting against it took the Democrats and the Administration by surprise Assurances Fell Through Mr Rostenkowski said he had been assured by the Treasury Secretary that he would have 40 Republican votes Representative Charles B Rangel of Manhattan a deputy Democratic whip said the Democrats whip mechanism for gathering in votes had been lulled by Mr Bakers assurances An Administration official who has followed the progress of tax legislation closely said the White House had stumbled badly He and others noted that after the Ways and Means Committee completed drafting the tax bill Nov 23 a bill that differed substantially from the Presidents original proposal Mr Reagan was silent for more than two weeks Mr Baker the officials said urged an immediate Presidential endorsement not necessarily of the substance of the bill but of the necessity of passing the Democratic measure in the House so the Senate could go to work on it next year But Donald T Regan the Presidents chief of staff was said to have been upset by many elements of the bill and to have argued for a study of the economic consequences The President resting after his summit meeting in Geneva said nothing A OneShot Deal When Mr Reagan finally issued a statement last week it did not specifically call for a vote on the Democratic bill Last Monday he sent a forceful letter to all Representatives saying explicitly that he wanted them to vote for the measure but it may have been too late Republicans had already staked out positions They let the toothpaste out of the tube and cant get it back again said an aide to the Democratic leadership The Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts said the Republicans had showed the President there was independence out there and if you lose them once youre going to lose them a second time Mr Lott did not agree with that assessment Were going to win many more victories for the President he said This was a oneshot deal A White House official preferred to put the best light on the developments Theyve certainly gotten attention he said of the Republican lawmakers This may prove conducive to better relations in the future
ARE THOSE FICTIONAL DOCTORS BAD FOR THE VIEWER'S HEALTH?,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/arts/are-those-fictional-doctors-bad-for-the-viewer-s-health.html,While filming Spellbound Alfred Hitchcock hired a prominent psychiatrist to advise on medical aspects of the script When the doctor complained to the director that he was ignoring her suggestions Hitchcock replied My dear this is motionpicture drama not a psychoanalysis In the mid1940s of course television was only in its infancy Nonetheless since the mediums earliest days medical dramas have been a staple of the small screen Just the thought of Ben Casey Dr Kildare Marcus Welby or Hawkeye Pierce conjures up the image of the cureall doctor who cared deeply about his patients remedied every ailment and whose M D really stood for medical deity rather than for medical doctor And today because it is so pervasive commercial television continues to be for many Americans the No 1 source of medical information  and misinformation Recent conversations with writers producers and others involved with several shows with a medical premise including NBCs St Elsewhere and CBSs Trapper John M D as well as those evening soap operas that occasionally use medical settings such as CBSs Falcon Crest help explain the quality  or lack thereof  of medical information on primetime television To most of televisions writers and producers medicine represents technical background When they use medicine as a subject it is only as a setting in which to discuss human relationships For them medicine is not real drama Moreover television production is a highpressure business involving rigid schedules big money and even bigger egos Scripts change rapidly story lines are altered radically even a few days before filming begins and although writers and producers might like to be precise medical accuracy is generally a low priority John Masius a coproducer of St Elsewhere describes the medicine in television shows as texture Admittedly many shows with predominantly medical settings list a medical or technical advisor in their credits The technical advisor is often a registered nurse who works on the set to make sure medical equipment is handled properly and that medical scenes look realistic The medical advisor is usually a physician who checks scripts for medical inaccuracies and answers writers questions about medical procedures The medical advisor is basically hired to be a policeman because writers and producers know they need one They use medicine as a gimmick rather than as an art form Executives of major medical shows do not dispute this assessment Medicine is the byproduct says Tom Fontana the coproducer of St Elsewhere We want to make good stories about human beings who happen to be doctors and nurses and patients As Bruce Paltrow executive producer of the series explains When we write an episode we write the script with certain characters and relationships in mind When we get to a part requiring medical dialogue we leave a space on the page and call it medical talk We write that in later with the help of the medical advisor But even when technical advisors are employed their suggestions often receive only token acceptance Last years season premiere of Falcon Crest began with an airplane crash followed by a helicopter rescue in which the injured passengers were taken to a nearby hospital The producers did hire a helicopter rescue squad as consultants for the rescue scene but for the hospital scene  in which a major character died  no attempt was made to make the events medically accurate Although the victim was dying of internal injuries she was not placed in an intensivecare ward but rather in a simple room without supervision With her husband standing over her she took a last gasp and expired in true Hollywood fashion Liberties were taken acknowledges Richard Dunnault an assistant director But he adds it is not necessary for a drama series such as Falcon Crest to be medically accurate after all it isnt a documentary Though primetime series set in hospital surroundings may strive for higher standards even the more realistic of them sometimes fail to appreciate the realities of medical practice Earlier this year during the filming of an operatingroom scene on St Elsewhere Charles Eglee one of the writers walked up to the operating table and said I cant believe people really cut other people open Had he ever witnessed a real operation he was asked No he replied For another episode Steve Bello a writer on the series wanted to bring in a CATscan machine to prove a character was insane When Barbara Krause the registered nurse who was the technical advisor suggested that neuropsychological testing might be more appropriate than a CAT scan Mr Bello retorted Well Hinckley had one alluding to John Hinckley whose attempted assassination of President Reagan in March 1981 caused him to undergo extensive medical examinations The machine was eliminated from the scene mainly for cost considerations but a line about using a CAT scan remained in the script despite its lack of appropriateness Clearly commonsense notions often carry more weight than expert medical advice And not just among writers and producers Network standardsandpractices executives often take accurate medical information and transform it into misleading information In their eagerness to eliminate things that might not be considered appropriate for primetime viewing they too often rely on old notions of what is or is not wholesome An episode of Trapper John M D became misleading and ambiguous when the network standardsandpractices department would not permit the phrase septic abortion to be used on the air In that episode a woman suffered a miscarriage after a fall in a bathroom she had collapsed because she was septic that is had a generalized infection But without the explanation it appeared as though a woman could easily miscarry just by falling There are other similar examples The NBC censor did not want the word nipple used in a St Elsewhere script about breast cancer On the same series an entire scene dealing with a female pelvic infection had to be cut after the censor said no to using the word pelvic on the air Nonetheless St Elsewhere s Bruce Paltrow says that he occasionally insists on including forbidden words  and not without some justification As he tells it in one episode of the series a few seasons ago the network censor objected to the use of the word testicle in a script about a young man suffering from testicular cancer The producer persisted and finally won After watching the segment a teenager detected a lump that was found to be cancerous According to Mr Paltrow the young viewer subsequently underwent surgery and is free of the disease today Physicians themselves also seem to have trouble differentiating between illusion and reality A few years ago Alan Alda one of the stars of the longrunning MASH series gave the commencement address at Columbia Universitys College of Physicians and Surgeons last year William Daniels the actor who plays Dr Marc Craig on St Elsewhere was invited to deliver the commencement address at two medical schools And while public television offers many impressive programs dealing with health issues those Americans who get most of their medical information from television  usually the less educated and those with lower incomes  are precisely the viewers who prefer Dynasty to PBS As to educating the viewing public it is not so important for every medicine dosage to be correct or that a shows star be able to rattle off the names of unpronouncable diseases Most viewers wont know the difference anyway Besides who cares how much of a certain drug gets prescribed or whether the patient really did have pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolacaniconeosis  it detracts from the drama Such subjects as basic cardiopulmonary resusitation teenage alcoholism teenage pregnancy and smoking prevention can be equally as dramatic  and far more educational  than Give him 40 milligrams propanolol qd or Get me a CBC Type and Cross SMA6 and 12 One way to make medical shows more informative would be for the medical advisor to be an integral part of the producing team someone who can help increase the educational level of a show without jeopardizing the drama Recently for example an episode of CBSs Cagney and Lacey dealt with the issue of breast cancer in a way that was both dramatic and informative Mary Beth Lacey develops a lump in her breast but she attempts to deny it is there The remainder of the sequence traces her course from denial to acceptance and treatment In order for primetime television to be more medically accurate writers should nurture a more sensitive appreciation of the inherent drama in medicine and strive to translate that appreciation dramatically to the viewing public They must recognize that in order to be honest to their craft they must be honest to the subject they write about Meanwhile it is the responsibility of the viewer to search for the truths in the fiction and it is the obligation of physicians to realize that television is part of their patients education Rather than minimizing the impact of the medium they should help their patients to understand what is seen on television As Picasso once said Art is not truth Art is a lie that helps you understand the truth
ABDUCTIONS IN SALVADOR FILL A DEMAND: ADOPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/17/world/abductions-in-salvador-fill-a-demand-adoption.html,A stranger snatched a baby from a womans arms the other day She had just come out of a hospital moving slowly clutching a bundle of clothes and her dayold boy As she hesitated before crossing the street a man lurched toward her The woman screamed but the kidnapper got away Officials at a family court who told the story said they had found no trace of the child It probably went the way of other babies and was sent to the United States one lawyer said The incident the officials said was part of what the Minister of Justice Julio Samayoa recently called the scandalous and alarming trade in children in El Salvador Adoption which has benefited many orphans and abandoned children in this troubled society has now begun to haunt the country By official account the enormous foreign demand for children has led not only to profiteering and fraud but also to falsification of documents and child kidnappings The Government has ordered an investigation and said it intends to tighten the rules Many Infants Go to US We plan to make it harder to adopt said Carmen Barahona the Deputy Interior Minister We are not against adoption it can do a lot of good But whats going on is terrible We dont want children used for business Many of the infants go to the United States where the demand for adoption appears greatest and people are willing to pay the highest legal fees Several hundred babies are also sent to Canada and Europe every year While there are reputable lawyers involved in adoption work others have turned it into a lucrative business foreign diplomats and Salvadoran officials said They said a number of lawyers had created their own procurement networks that included scouts who persuaded destitute mothers to give up their babies caretakers who ran makeshift nurseries and people who arranged for false documents The hundreds of adoptions here annually yield by some estimates more than a million dollars a year largely in exorbitant agent and lawyer fees United States consular officers said some lawyers pay kickbacks to their contacts and agents in the United States Two Americans working as baby facilitators are under investigation by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service the officers said While the semiclandestine world of baby procurement has existed here for several years kidnappings have reportedly increased in recent months and caused widespread alarm According to David Keane Leavitt an adoption lawyer in Beverly Hills Calif there is no Federal law that requires those who want to adopt to ascertain the legality of the placement But he said it would be prudent of them to seek to satisfy themselves that the placement was legal to protect themselves from future claims that might jeopardize the adoption What the US Law Says The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that the natural parent execute a written consent for adoption and immigration The consent must be presented to the American consul in the country of the childs birth before a visa is issued The counsul must also have a birth certificate and a health certificate from a physician If anyone whether an agent or adopting parent knowingly accepts a child under fraudulent circumstances by falsifying the immigration documents or lying to the immigration authorities that would violate United States immigration laws The police and other officials declined to provide details about the scope of the kidnappings in El Salvador The idea is to avoid panic said an official of a state welfare agency I know of at least 10 cases this year only in the capital It also goes on in the interior In recent weeks fears have run through San Salvadors poor neighborhoods In Zacamil a drab public housing complex on a hillside north of the city women talked angrily about the lack of police protection and said they were keeping their children indoors Two sisters who said they were still too nervous to give their names reenacted for a visitor how a man with a gun had ordered them to hand over their toddlers One sister ran off screaming and the man fled they said A Glimpse of the Chaos Noemi Escobar who runs a small store here had woven a web of string across her front gate to prevent her children from slipping through the bars Fighting back her tears she recalled how a young man dressed nicely with a tie had first chatted and then tried to go off with Nely her 3yearold A neighbor saw him and yelled Last month the Government got a glimpse of the chaos an official involved in the investigation said when it ordered lawyers and babysitters to register immediately all infants in their care Of more than 120 children registered only 37 had proper documents he said The others were nonexistent or dubious The lax bureaucracy of El Salvador its civil war and vast poverty have made the country one of the main markets for foreign adoptions in this hemisphere The United States Consulate here reports that it handles more visas for adopted children than any other post except in South Korea and Colombia The flow has almost doubled since 1982 and is expected to reach about 400 this year Yet the issue of adoption also reflects the customs of Salvadoran society More than 70 percent of mothers here are not married a diplomat said Men take the values of parenthood lightly Its common to have children with more than one woman but often they cannot or will not look after them Speaking of the many unwanted pregnancies a supervisor at a maternity hospital said that poor women and even prostitutes often dont use birth control There is still a strong taboo about abortion she continued People here will say things like She was brave she had her child even if the mother later gives it away Church workers say there are orphans and abandoned children all over the country but no reliable statistics are available The children live in staterun or private institutions in shelters and in refugee camps Older waifs roam the capitals streets sleeping in buses and doorways doing odd chores stealing or begging for food Some of our babies were found on the street or in garbage cans said Oscar Pacheco a legal counsel at a staterun orphanage But children for adoption are obtained in other ways An official involved in the current investigation said some lawyers pay off hospital workers to bring babies left behind in the citys large maternity wards We have also learned that soldiers take orphans or lost children back to their barracks he added and we dont know what happens to them Baby scouts roam villages refugee camps and city slums In one refugee camp women told a visitor that an unknown man had coaxed them to give up some of their babies He said he had a friend who would send them to a rich country and they would be better off one of the women said Papers Easy to Falsify Once you have a child its easy to falsify papers said a lawyer considered reputable by the United States Consulate A woman is asked to pose as a mother and she gets a birth certificate Then the fake mother signs a paper consenting to adoption Other procedures like getting a judges permission and a passport then usually take place above board the lawyer said Lawyers fees of 1500 to 2000 are reasonable diplomats believe but those adopting have often been charged 5000 to 10000 On top of their fee lawyers often claim large additional expenses like baby care and paying off judges one official said Yet other lawyers insisted they never had to pay off a judge Whats happening here is terrible for adoption said a lawyer who often takes sick babies into her own home It has given a noble institution a very bad name United States Consulate officials said they had begun to scrutinize visa applications more closely and now demand that the mother appear to state she is giving up her child

"FOR PARENTS OF PREGNANT CHILDREN, NEW LIABILITY",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/18/garden/for-parents-of-pregnant-children-new-liability.html,The state that pioneered the open primary income taxes and unemployment compensation has now devised a novel approach for addressing teenage pregnancy A wideranging law adopted unanimously by the State Legislature last month provides for sex education in public schools grants for programs to counsel teenagers abortions without the necessity of parental consent and the establishment of a state adoption center But what has caught the attention of most Wisconsin parents and teenagers is a section known as the grandparents liability law Under this law parents of teenagers who have babies are now legally obligated to provide financial support for those babies so far as the parent is able and the teenager is not The obligation would continue until the teenager turns 18 years old marries or joins the military This portion of the Abortion Prevention and Family Responsibility Act of 1985 is being hailed and damned in equal measure and all before it has actually been implemented in any concrete way The objective of the act is to reduce the number of abortions by significantly reducing the number of teenage pregnancies and when pregnancies do occur by offering teenagers other options There is no information on the number of Wisconsin teenagers who choose abortion Nationally however according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute a research organization devoted to reproductive health issues teenagers account for about 28 percent of the 15 million abortions performed annually They were second only to women 20 to 24 who accounted for 35 percent of the abortions In 1981 the last year for which the institute has complete data the pregnancy rate among teenage girls was 111 per 1000 Of those 43 per 1000 had abortions In Wisconsin last year 7736 babies were born to teenagers an overwhelming number of whom live in Milwaukee According to the experts a teenage parent is more likely than not to drop out of high school and to become trapped in the cycle of poverty Nationwide about 60 percent of all teenage mothers require public aid Under Wisconsins new grandparents liability law the determining factor is no longer the teenage mothers lack of income Now the incomes of the childs father and its maternal and paternal grandparents would also be taken into consideration The idea is that parents will try harder to prevent their children from engaging in sexual activity and that teenagers will be on guard knowing that their parents could pay for their mistakes But no one knows what effect this provision could have While some say for example that it should reduce the welfare rolls others argue that it might unduly penalize the working poor Ramona Cordova for example is a 17yearold junior at South Division High School which has provided classes and services for teenage parents for several years She is also the mother of two sons 10 months and 2 years old Some parents are hardly making it with their income she said How are they going to manage with a grandson or granddaughter when they can hardly make ends meet While some people think the law will reduce sexual activity among teenagers others believe it will be a further inducement for abortions Barbara L Lyons the legislative director of Wisconsin Citizens Concerned for Life a coalition that opposes abortion said girls may be pressured into having abortions because their parents may see the financial responsibility as being something bigger and more unmanageable than actually it may be For different reasons Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin also finds fault with the law Its executive director Doug Jackson said The issue is who are you penalizing Some parents are going to take the position that its not their mistake that theres a limit to responsibility and that supporting a minor childs minor child is going over some fine line A number of girls interviewed here said they had been expelled from their homes when they became pregnant Others said they remained home but had to bear the wrath not only of their own parents but also of their boyfriends parents as well None of them thought the grandparents liability law would do anything but add to the bad feelings among family members Sister Kathryn Keifer who is executive director of Ebenezer Child Care a group that operates nurseries at South Division High School and elsewhere agreed It just strikes me as too much of a punitive measure she said of the law Most parents dont want their teenagers to become pregnant What more can they do At Rosalie Manor a residence and counseling program for young mothers no one thought the law would curtail teenage sexuality Kiki an expectant 16yearold said Us kids are determined to do what we want no matter what the parents say Pamela a 16yearold with a 4monthold daughter said teenagers might protect themselves more but I dont think they will stop having sex And Chris an expectant 15yearold said the law has inspired more defiance among her friends Now she said teenagers are saying Hey great Im 14 Im 15 and if I get pregnant my parents are stuck paying for this baby if I want to keep it If any good results from the law said Sheri Beranja who teaches parent skills at South Division High it could be a more equal sharing of childrearing responsibilities between teenage mothers and fathers As several girls in her class nodded in agreement she said I see these girls just burdened in the mornings with their babies their diaper bags and their book bags Their social life is maybe one night off a week And I see the boys off playing basketball somewhere As of now officials in the Milwaukee County Department of Social Services said they have been given no guidance in implementing the law They do not know whether to deny benefits to girls or to grant them public assistance and try to collect later from the liable grandparents The law took effect Nov 20 Counties have been dealing with situations on a casebycase basis The state expects to issue guidelines by midJanuary As Wisconsin sorts out its new law which is subject to review in three years public officials in Maryland Ohio California Iowa and Minnesota among others have expressed an interest in it That delights Marlin D Schneider a State Representative from Wisconsin Rapids who initiated the law He said it began when he grew tired of the State Legislature adjourning year after year without addressing the volatile issue of abortion Finally Mr Schneider said he urged the legislative leadership to appoint a committee composed about equally of advocates and opponents of abortion and to give them the task of designing a legislative package Everybody thought we were goofy he said It was like trying to negotiate between the Sunnis and the Shiites in Beirut The 16member committee agreed early on that reducing teenage pregnancies would also reduce abortions But while much of the public debate centered on the wisdom of sex education programs little attention was paid to Mr Schneiders own contribution the grandparents liability provision Now he said many people on both sides of the abortion question dislike the law His reaction Despite the criticism Mr Schneider said the response from people in the state has been generally favorable They feel that finally someone has done something positive about the problem of abortion and teenage pregnancy he said At least one other member of the committee the Rev J Thomas Finucan who is pastor of St Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church in Stevens Point Wis supports the grandparents liability law Parents are in fact responsible for the acts of their minor children so to extend that principle to this area seems to me very logical he said Given the strong opinions of those who consider themselves prolife and those who consider themselves prochoice Father Finucan said the fact that the Abortion Prevention and Family Responsibility Act exists at all is wellnigh miraculous It would also be miraculous many Wisconsinites say if the law works
Abortion Bombers' Christmas Message,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/18/opinion/abortion-bombers-christmas-message.html,The Christmas season is many things to many people To Americas domestic terrorists it is as it was last year prime time to escalate the battle against a womans legal right to a safe abortion Last week a small bomb went off at the Manhattan Womens Medical Center Because a caller had warned the police bomb squad the building was evacuated in time No anonymous caller however warned a Portland Ore womens health center that the large package in its mail a few weeks ago was a bomb big enough to kill Fortunately a staff worker had been trained to spot suspicious packages and called the police Portlands postal authorities then found three other mail bombs addressed to two abortion clinics and a Planned Parenthood clinic that doesnt even perform abortions The Portland police believe the bombs are intended to rally opposition to Senator Bob Packwood a supporter of abortion rights who will be seeking a fourth term next year The Senator has won sufficient popularity that he can probably survive the attacks but the staffs and patients at those clinics have no such defense Except for chance the antiabortion bombers might now be claiming their first fatalities During the last two years there have been 50 bombing and arson incidents at abortion and familyplanning clinics nearly twice as many as in the previous six years Those responsible claim to be championing life What theyre really doing with their explosives fires and threats is saying to women Not your choice lady Ours

IDEAS & TRENDS;   A DIOCESE FAILS TO BLOCK 2 CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/weekinreview/ideas-trends-a-diocese-fails-to-block-2-clinics.html,New York States highest court rejected last week a suit by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany that had sought to prevent the State Health Department from issuing permits for two abortion clinics The decision by the State Court of Appeals overturned two lowercourt rulings that would have required the department to conduct a more thorough investigation of the need for the clinics one in Albany the other in nearby Hudson The case was the first in the United States according to church and state officials in which a Catholic diocese sought to prevent the licensing of abortion clinics The departments rules permit the operation of a clinic if state health officials determine that fewer than half the abortions in an area were performed outside hospitals In bringing the suit Bishop Howard J Hubbard contended that the department had conducted only a cursory investigation before issuing approval to the sponsor Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood to open the clinics A state Supreme Court justice found in February that the rule was arbitrary and that additional review of the need for the clinics was necessary In June an appeals court agreed The decision last week held that the disputed regulation was a guideline not a strict rule and that the department was free to approve operation of the facilities Attorney General Robert Abrams called the decision an important reaffirmation of the states procedures
"FOR CALIFORNIA'S TOP JUDGE, THE TRIALS OF A CAMPAIGN",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/weekinreview/for-california-s-top-judge-the-trials-of-a-campaign.html,In a single evening recently lawyers businessmen and Hollywood entertainers contributed 280000 to the reelection campaign of Rose Elizabeth Bird the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court That day the first of a planned wave of thousands of video cassettes containing what Miss Birds supporters characterize as vicious attacks were distributed to California voters by one of four conservative groups vowing to prevent her return to the bench With almost 11 months to go the judicial election shaping up in California has become a bitter costly freeforall that is raising new questions about how America chooses its judges Around the country contributors to conservative causes say their mailboxes are swamped with appeals for contributions to help defeat Miss Bird Some also call for the defeat of Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph R Grodin who like Miss Bird were appointed to the court by Edmund G Brown Jr the Democratic former Governor The appeals portray Miss Bird a onetime public defender named to head the court in 1977 as an intellectual lightweight who has imposed a liberal bias on the courts rulings consistently overturning death sentences on moral grounds Twice since 1977 the states legislators and voters have strongly endorsed capital punishment Miss Bird has been firing back calling her critics rightwing bully boys and little Eddie Meeses while busily raising money often from lawyers and other people with a financial stake in the courts decisions By years end aides say Miss Bird expects to have raised about 1 million the organizations opposing her say they will have more than 2 million By Election Day some California politicians expect total campaign spending to exceed 5 million According to some legal experts the spectacle of a presiding judge of a prestigious court having to restyle her hair as she recently has done to keep her job to defend her decisions through television commercials is symptomatic of a broader malady A recent study by Prof Roy A Schotland of the Georgetown University Law Center documented that judicial elections once rarely contested are becoming increasingly contentious and therefore increasingly expensive In addition to prompting judicial candidates to seek campaign contributions from lawyers and other potential litigants the study found the trend risks narrowing the pool of judicial candidates Another study scheduled to be released this week by the Fund for Modern Courts a nonprofit group in New York City that studies judicial trends shows that among elected rather than appointed judges there is a significant imbalance in the number of minorities and women In Professor Schotlands view judicial elections have become one of the hottest political battlegrounds of the 1980s largely because oftenemotional conflicts over school desegregation school prayer and abortion among other issues have made the courts more visible Though most such rulings are in Federal courts where judges have lifetime tenure he says voters are taking out their frustrations at state courts where they have the power to change judges The question of how state judges should be selected has been a point of contention since the Jacksonian era Direct elections instead of lifetime appointments became popular then as a way of holding judges accountable to the citizenry But direct election came to be criticized on the ground that it often produced judges who were poorly qualified or beholden to special interests As a result a potpourri of methods evolved 39 states now hold some type of election most of them nonpartisan Californias system adopted in 1934 and later copied by other states strives to balance merit accountability and independence by having the governor nominate candidates for the states highest court who must then be approved by a Commission on Judicial Appointments The appointee serves on the court until the next gubernatorial election when the judge faces the voters as well Each judge must then stand for reelection periodically As the battle intensifies over Miss Birds effort to retain her job she and her supporters are contending that the principal issue is judicial independence  and with it the need to protect the courts from efforts by the political right to affect the courts decisions It doesnt make any difference if the court is liberal conservative or somewhere in between Miss Bird told a reporter for a Los Angeles legal newspaper recently What they want is somebody who will do exactly what they want on particular issues so that when they push a button you salivate on signal they want a Pavlovian justice Her critics argue that the real issue is accountability The California Constitution they point out requires judges to face the voters at least once every 12 years and Miss Bird won only 52 percent of the votes in 1978 An opinion survey released two weeks ago by the respected Mervin Field organization indicated that only 35 percent of the states voters favor retaining her for another term
VIGOR WINS NEW LIFE FOR FIREARMS AGENCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/us/vigor-wins-new-life-for-firearms-agency.html,Four years ago it was perhaps the most obscure of large Federal agencies an outfit with an ungainly name and almost no influential friends In fact it was a lawenforcement agency that even President Reagan did not like and had proposed to abolish Some thought this pretty shabby treatment of a proud organization whose roots went back to the Whisky Rebellion of 1794 and which in a recent achievement traced in just 14 minutes the gun John Hinckley used to shoot Mr Reagan Yet the agency the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms has not only survived but also has achieved a remarkable turnaround It has become visibly successful morale seems high and some former critics are singing its praises In short it and Stephen E Higgins the 47year old Kansan who has been its head for three years are on something of a roll He Finds All Signals Good All the signals we get both from the Administration and the Hill are that they think we are an effective agency Mr Higgins asserts The plan to transfer its duties to the Secret Service and the Customs Service two of the the bureaus sister units in the Treasury Department seems to have passed by Much of the bureaus resurgence arises from exceptional performance in investigating bombings of abortion clinics The bureau has solved 25 of 38 bombing incidents in three and a half years years with the result that more than a dozen people have gone to prison This success has prompted Representative Don Edwards a liberal Democrat from California who was among those who had pressed to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation take jurisdiction from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to offer a testimonial Our initial reservation has been washed away by their hardworking group of investigators said Mr Edwards once an agent with the FBI Rifle Association Shifts A still less likely booster is the National Rifle Association which in the late 1970s complained loudly about what it considered abusive enforcement tactics by the bureau The act really does seem to have cleaned up down there said Andrew T Kendzie an NRA spokesman But Mr Kendzie says the association is still unhappy that many of those who were involved in the disputed practices which the rifle association considers amounted to entrapment are still on the payroll We would have hoped he declared that somebody would have said Youre fired youre gone That has not happened The bureau which performs a dizzying variety of tasks has scored in many fields For example its laboratory in Rockville Md taught the Europeans a thing or two about chemical analysis when it began to study adulterated wines from Austria and the agency is given much of the credit for a sharp decline in interstate cigarette smuggling Paramilitary Groups Raided And it has conducted a number of successful raids on paramilitary groups including one last

of the agencys rising esteem and for various less heralded efforts in wine labeling ireworks manufacturing and a drive against the spread of illegal automatic weapons Although he rose through the compliance side of the agency which collects more than 10 billion a year in revenues from alcohol and tobacco taxes and gun fees Mr Hills is said to have won the respect of his law enforcement people who tend to look to their own for leadership according to James O Pasco an assistant director Mr Pasco also calls his boss a quick study a very accomplished motivator and the man who held the agency together when it was under attack We were going to be swallowed by two other agencies Mr Higgins recalls and we lost a lot of good people After plotting a course for the expected transition he says then almost abruptly we shifted plans and started putting it back together Without him an aide declares there wouldnt have been much to save Fears of Secret Service One reason for the Administrations change was the sudden realization by the National Rifle Association that the new enforcer of the gun laws would be the Secret Service The rifle association contended the Secret Service would have too little to do in years in which there was no national political campaign and might harass gunowners The bureau long ago become accustomed to the political fact that a centralized firearms registration system is regarded by gun owners as the first step toward confiscation He Joined in Omaha Mr Higgins is a career agency employee having joined the Omaha office as an inspector after graduating from Emporia College now defunct in 1961 and rising to increasingly responsible jobs in Dallas Philadelphia San Francisco Washington and Chicago before becoming deputy director in 1979 Almost relentlessly casual going to lunch often means standing in a snack bar line with other employees who call him Steve Mr Higgins is nonetheless said to be a stickler about knowing his agencys every move He suffered a rare loss of composure recently when embarrassed by a compliment from another Government official about an operation he had been unaware of He also doesnt seem given the nature of his job to be much of a worrier After the lab identified some contaminated Italian wine not long ago Mr Higgins discovered some of it at his home in McLean Va I had some in the icebox one of those bottles he says But I went ahead and drank it It was too much of a hassle to take it back

"CAPTIVE AFGHANISTAN, 6 YEARS LATER;   Of Lawyers' Work, There Is No End",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/opinion/captive-afghanistan-6-years-later-of-lawyers-work-there-is-no-end.html,The United States licenses more lawyers in one year than the total number of lawyers in Japan We now employ more than 625000 lawyers Undergraduate students who are interested in law frequently ask me if there will be any jobs left for them after they leave law school I assure them that the United States will continue to be a lawyers paradise There will always be a demand for legal assistance although there are now predictions that employment prospects are not expanding as rapidly as in the past Still I rattle off the reasons why the United States will remain such a litigious and laworiented society The evidence is clear American culture encourages lawsuits It is materialistic so there is a strong pursuit of wealth and security It is individualistic and competitive so there are many disputes to resolve and criminals to prosecute It is idealistic so there is a strong principle of justice to satisfy Americas great wealth insures that extensive liability insurance and generous judicial awards can be afforded The common law tradition works on the principle of using precedent for making judicial decisions The process is adversarial and every plaintiff can find a precedent somewhere to make a case You say that your shopping bag broke while you were unloading the car and a can of pineapple juice broke your toe Well someone somewhere sued and won a case just like it The main reason that precedents abound is that the United States has both an extensive and decentralized court system There are thousands of municipal courts 50 state courts and Federal courts in 95 districts Each churns out judicial decisions many of which can be appealed The American legislative system is extensive and decentralized too Thousands of city and town councils make laws as do state legislatures and each branch of the Federal Government The more laws there are the more private disputes will become legal disputes Lawyers can create a demand for their services From blatant advertising targeted at recruiting clients who suffered personal injury or exposure to toxic substances to the more subtle listing of specialties in the Yellow Pages the public is made aware of its opportunities One law firm advertised that it could handle a full array of injury claims including birth defects death claims work injuries burns defective products transit injuries drug reactions brain damage spinal cord injury In addition many lawyers work on a contingency fee basis  that is the client pays no fees unless the lawyers win money for you Why not go for it Whats to lose Prelaw students at this point smile assured that a field of considerable opportunity still awaits them I am not finished I say Perhaps the most important reason for our vast legal establishment has not even been mentioned The United States system of checks and balances and of separation of powers was purposely designed to make policymaking difficult Whatever one branch wants can be thwarted by another The Federal Government is too divided and too weak to resolve many social disputes That is why the courts have dealt extensively with such disputes as abortion school segregation criminal rights legislative apportionment prayer homosexuals rights gun control environmental hazards nuclear power smoking and so on When a legislature is incapable of resolving social political and economic disputes the courts have to resolve them America needs the strongest court system in the world because domestically it has the weakest policymaking system in the world The students by this point understand why America needs all the lawyers it can get But do they too readily accept this without asking about the consequences Do they question what so much law and so many lawyers do to the quality of life
Q&A: Solicitor General Charles Fried;   Of Power and the Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/28/us/q-a-solicitor-general-charles-fried-of-power-and-the-law.html,Solicitor General Charles Fried the top Supreme Court advocate of an Administration that has been more critical of the Court than any in recent history tasted controversy even before his Senate confirmation in October Most of it surrounded the Administrations brief which he filed this summer as Acting Solicitor General urging the Court to overrule its 1973 decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion More recently Mr Fried told the United States Chamber of Commerce that he did not believe much of what the press reports and he accused reporters of being uninformed asking silly questions and distorting Administration positions Mr Fried discussed a range of issues in a recent interview Excerpts follow Q You have suggested the press is interested only in provoking officials to make embarrassing comments and not in serious analysis of issues Please elaborate A Well I suppose that on due reflection those impromptu remarks were the unreflecting reaction of a newcomer who works with very complicated manysided issues people and rights very intricate legal documents and then is frustrated to find that all those subtleties and intricacies tend to get flattened out by the exigencies of five column inches What Id really like you to do is reprint my briefs in their entirety but I guess you cant do that Q Some lawyers have also faulted some of the more eloquent language  rhetorical flourishes if you will in your briefs on abortion and racial quotas Are you being criticized for good writing A Well I dislike that criticism more than anything I think its seriously unfair Those briefs read in their entirety are factually accurate analytically correct and respectful to the Court in their tone If they are also written in a lively and distinctive style I have no apology to make for that I know of no canon or tradition that requires legal writing to be turgid and boring Q Do you agree with Attorney General Edwin Meese that the original intention of the Framers is the only reliable guide for judgment in interpreting the Constitution A In some respects I think I would go further than the Attorney General because I think the principal guide for judgment should be the language of the law in this case the language of the Constitution But your question invites that we put the views of the Attorney General with which I am in agreement in a larger context I think an important concern of mine and of this Administration is that the law should operate as a constraint not only upon citizens but upon judges And the Attorney General is calling attention to the fact that the Constitution as much as any statute is law Q Your previous writing suggests that courts in recent decades in many areas of the law have irresponsibly created all sorts of new rights that make for bad policy Could you elaborate A What I have objected to is a posture on the part of some courts that if theres something in the world that doesnt seem to be going right that the courts have a commission more or less at large to fix it The view which I think is correct is that courts operate under law with only so much authority to act as the law gives them And that is an attitude which I think applies in disregarding the terms of a written contract to reform it so that it is fairer in the eyes of the judge though the parties didnt make that contract or revising the terms of the Constitution so that it is more responsive to what judges think is good social policy Q Should constitutional law embody what judges consider to be enlightened morality A The very notion that somehow judges notions of enlightened morality should be the source of their decisions is one which I strongly reject After all judges exercise power they exercise power over other people and most dramatically over the democratic process to limit  in the constitutional area  what the democratic process can accomplish Now that power surely should only be exercised on the basis of some warrant some authority And the only warrant for a judge exercising that rather dramatic form of power is the authority which the Constitution itself as a written document gives the judge I disagree with the notion judges have some special competence to discern enlightened morality They are no more competent than you or I or than legislators are Their special competence relates to the interpretation of law Q Some have pointed out that if conservative judges practice the judicial restraint the Administration has been preaching they will have to honor judicial precedents and legislative policies with which they profoundly disagree What do you think A That question has to be disaggregated Legislative policies insofar as they are constitutional bind the judiciary Insofar as constitutional precedents are concerned the Supreme Court itself has said on many occasions that in matters of constitutional law precedent must of necessity carry much less weight And I think that is agreed all around Q Mr Meese has denounced as infamous the Courts 1966 Miranda ruling which requires the police to inform arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer Does the Administration plan to urge the Court to overrule Miranda If not why not A I know of no grand plan or strategy in this area I have no such plan or strategy What we tend to do is argue cases as they arise and theres no doubt that a greater focus on a fair and accurate adjudication of guilt or innocence seems appropriate

New York Oxford University Press 2995 THE facts of this case are unavoidably distressing Needless heedless wanton and deliberate injury of the sort inflicted by Lifes picture story is not an essential instrument of responsible journalism Magazine writers and editors are not by reason of their high office relieved of the common obligation to avoid deliberately inflicting wanton and unnecessary injury The prerogatives of the press  essential to our liberty  do not    confer a license for pointless assault Abe Fortas made that stinging comment in an opinion written for the Supreme Court The opinion of the Court it was headed when Associate Justice Fortas circulated a draft to his colleagues on June 8 1966 in the case of Time Inc v James J Hill But when the case was decided the following January the opinion of the Court was by Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr and Justice Fortas dissented The sharp words of his 1966 draft opinion were never published  until now Bernard Schwartz a professor of law at New York University found the unpublished Fortas opinion in the papers of Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan at Princeton University With it were responses to the Fortas draft  dissents by Associate Justices William O Douglas and Byron R White a concurring opinion by Justice Harlan and a later bitterly critical memorandum by Associate Justice Hugo L Black All are printed in full in The Unpublished Opinions of the Warren Court With background material supplied by Mr Schwartz they tell the fascinating story of how the Supreme Court in the course of deciding the Hill case changed its mind Mr Hill and his family were held hostage in 1952 in their home outside Philadelphia by escaped convicts They were not harmed and afterward the Hills resolutely avoided publicity moving to Connecticut to put the episode behind them In 1955 a play about a fugitivehostage incident The Desperate Hours appeared on Broadway Though the author said it was not based on the Hill episode Life magazine put the actors in the Hills former home and published a story describing the play as a treatment of their desperate ordeal The Life article wounded the Hills putting them back in the glare of publicity Mr Hill sued for invasion of privacy and a New York jury eventually awarded him 30000 On appeal Time Inc publisher of Life argued that its right to publish the piece was protected by the First Amendments free press guarantee The New York courts held that the amendment did not prevent the award of damages for a fictionalized and invasive story Richard M Nixon then in private practice argued the case for Mr Hill in the Supreme Court The conservative politician found an intensely sympathetic audience in a liberal judge Justice Fortas who wrote with passion about the excesses of the press His unpublished opinion also included an eloquent statement of the constitutional basis for a right of privacy  a more compelling statement I think than in any published opinion on this issue A majority voted in conference to uphold the New York judgment for Mr Hill Chief Justice Earl Warren who was in the majority assigned the opinion to Justice Fortas But it was not a firm majority Doubts aroused by the dissents led the Court to put the case down for reargument the next term In the end five justices supported the Brennan opinion reversing the judgment for Mr Hill Justice Fortass dissent was joined by the Chief Justice and Associate Justice Tom C Clark Justice Harlan also wrote an opinion dissenting in part That bare account of what happened in the Hill case  all one can cram into a book review  does not do justice to the complexity and passion of the arguments inside the Court What we learn from those unpublished opinions dramatizes some important truths about the Supreme Court First the Supreme Court justices cannot do their work by pushing levers marked liberal or conservative Those political labels do not solve dilemmas like that in the Hill case the conflict between freedom of expression and another value privacy nor would such simpleminded ideas as looking to the views of those who wrote the Constitution  Attorney General Edwin Meese 3ds jurisprudence of original intention There are no historical documents to show how the framers of the First Amendment would have decided the Hill case Second the Court comes out well when we are given an opportunity to look behind its finished product and see the process at work The justices for all the tenacity of their views on basic questions do actually listen to one another They are moved by intellectual argument  moved enough even to change their votes This book shows us 10 cases in which the Court changed its results or its reasoning in the course of decision A notable example came in the sitin cases of 1964 when a majority was first prepared to join an opinion of Justice Blacks upholding the conviction of black students for trespass in refusing to leave a Maryland restaurant that would not serve them In the end the Court set aside the convictions on the ground that a new Maryland law forbidding racial discrimination in public accommodations had wiped them out An important instance of changed reasoning came in Griswold v Connecticut the 1965 decision holding a state law against the use of contraceptives unconstitutional as an invasion of the privacy of married couples We learn here the surprising fact that Justice Douglas first wrote an opinion finding the law violative of a right of association guaranteed by the First Amendment Only when Justice Brennan urged in a letter that the association protected by the First Amendment had to do with organizing for political and community reasons not the family did Justice Douglas shift and make his opinion the privacy landmark it has come to be In title and ingredients this book recalls Alexander Bickels 1957 classic The Unpublished Opinions of Mr Justice Brandeis But there are important differences Bickel used those opinions to illuminate the philosophy of one of our greatest judges He dealt with history the cases he discussed had been decided at least 27 years before the justices involved had all left the Court the issues were no longer on the judicial agenda Mr Schwartz writes of cases decided as recently as 1970 Three justices involved  Mr Brennan Mr White and Thurgood Marshall  are still active And issues ranging from privacy to capital punishment remain very much under debate on the Court The book thus raises what are by now familiar questions What effect will such disclosures have on the work of the Court Will the justices be able to argue among one another with the candor that may change minds if they think their words will soon be retailed to the public Or will their conferences degenerate into posturing like most Congressional debates The questions were first seriously raised in 1956 in Alpheus Thomas Masons book Harlan Fiske Stone Pillar of the Law which used notes from Chief Justice Stones files  material that was inevitably onesided and that reflected on justices still sitting Justice Black was so troubled by the Mason book that on his deathbed 15 years later he insisted that his son burn all his Court files The new genre of books penetrating the Courts secrecy reached a sales peak in 1979 with The Brethren by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong which offered unattributed gossip and inside stories of mixed accuracy Two years ago in Super Chief a massive book on the Warren Court Mr Schwartz reconstructed what purported to be verbatim quotations from the justices conferences In important instances he did not disclose his sources making it difficult to judge the fairness of the accounts might they have come from one side in a hotly disputed case It is no doubt oldfashioned to worry about such things But the Supreme Court is one institution that works in this country and I think scholars should be wary of distorting the conference that is so essential to its work After all the Court unlike say the President does not in the end act in secret It acts only through published judgments and it is held accountable by their persuasiveness T HOSE concerns are less pressing in The Unpublished Opinions Here Mr Schwartz relies primarily on documents and he tells us where he found all but one Eight of his sets of opinions came from the Harlan papers and one from the Felix Frankfurter papers at the Harvard Law School A penciled memorandum by Chief Justice Warren that amounted to a first draft of his opinion in Brown v Board of Education came from the Warren papers at the Library of Congress The opinion with no source indicated is the Douglas draft in the Griswold case Mr Schwartz is not always a perfect guide to his material He strains to make each change of mind he describes critically important in history and sometimes he overdoes it He says for example that if Justice Douglas had not rewritten his Griswold opinion to base it on privacy the Supreme Court might not have held state laws against abortion unconstitutional in 1973  a dubious conclusion In his discussion of the Maryland sitin cases he quotes a colorful passage of Justice Blacks that does not appear in the text given  a mystifying discrepancy He dismisses Justice Harlan as sound rather than brilliant a silly characterization of a wise judge But the unpublished opinions are the heart of the matter and there is no doubt of their interest to any student of the Supreme Court They are riveting history and not only for scholars No one who reads this book will find it easy to believe that the Court can function on the basis of some formula political or historical

A BIT OF VIETNAM IS PLANTED IN CHINA,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/31/world/a-bit-of-vietnam-is-planted-in-china.html,In a clearing between rice paddies a shirtless youth pedals rhythmically on a threshing machine Close by an old woman with a bun of silver hair cries across the paddies to summon an idling water buffalo Crickets chatter in the trees As the last sunlight fades a new image enters the tableau something not of China at all Along a pathway wending toward distant mountains a man on a motorbike appears his face hidden by a plastic pith helmet A laughing girl rides on the back seat They look like something from the streets of Vietnam and they are This community in the southeast of Hainan Island about 275 miles across the Gulf of Tonkin from Vietnam has something in common with hundreds of towns and cities in the United States that are a world removed from the rice paddies of Xinglong Since 1978 people here have been adjusting to the influx of a large number of refugees from Vietnam who have brought with them a way of life and expectations that have not always blended harmoniously with local tradition Out of Their Element The taste for motorbikes and pith helmets has been readily accommodated But other differences have proved less easy to reconcile Although almost all of the refugees were ethnic Chinese they were predominantly urban dwellers in Vietnam with little preparation for the rural milieu into which they were cast In addition they were grafted onto a community of migrants that was already populous Resentments were inevitable especially when the newcomers were granted exemption from the strict onechildperfamily policy applied to others in Xinglong More than 5500 outcasts from Vietnam arrived amid Xinglongs groves of bananas pepper and papaya over a period of 15 months They joined more than 20000 Chinese from two previous waves of forced migration the first from Malaya during the antiCommunist emergency of the 1950s and the second from Indonesia in the mid1960s when a government crackdown on Communists broadened into a wholesale assault on Chinese Together the two earlier groups founded and developed the Xinglong state farm one of the largest rubber plantations on an island that counts rubber as its economic mainstay The bulk of the exodus from Vietnam after the Communist takeover in the south in 1975 fell on other Asian nations especially Thailand and eventually on the United States which has taken in more than 700000 people of Vietnamese descent But in the late 1970s the problem lapped over into China The Government in Hanoi moving progressively into the Soviet camp turned hostile toward its Chinese minority prompting more than 280000 Chinese to flee to their ancestral homeland China wary of the potentially unsettling consequences chose to disperse most to state farms across the southern provinces of Yunnan Guangdong Fujian and Jiangxi as well as in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region About 1500 of the refugees have subsequently been resettled with relatives in the West but the remainder have stayed on the farms Hainan has one of the largest concentrations Problems Glossed Over Recently Xinglong suffered its worst shock in years when a refugee attacked a neighboring family slaying the parents and two children before killing himself The crime problem like others is glossed over by local Communist Party officials who accompany visitors to the farm But cracks in the presentation begin to show when a visitor talks to one of the refugees spontaneously Moments after the farms propaganda secretary Li Guoliang had said that no more than a handful of the young people from Vietnam had shown any interest in leaving for the West the first youth approached said that it was his main aim Go to America Of course said Xie Shouzhi at 22 the oldest of seven children who came to Xinglong with their parents from a rural county outside Haiphong People say that things in foreign countries are very good much better than here As if to advertise his preference the young rubber worker wore jeans and a madeinHong Kong Tshirt The keenest source of the jealousies generated by the transplantation of outsiders is the differentiated family planning policy According to Mr Li the rule for the refugees from Vietnam is that a second child is permitted once the first child reaches the age of 6 with an ascending scale of monthly administrative fees or fines for every child thereafter Among earlier settlers and the Chinese population of Hainan in general heavy pressure for abortion arises after the first child regardless of the interval According to figures compiled by the United Nations more than 30000 children have been born to refugee families since they arrived in China with some families having as many as seven and eight children It is one reason why the Government has appealed to the world body for help in resettling some of the refugee families in the West Hanoi Draws Their Hatred The hopes of many at Xinglong seemed captured by a postcard of San Francisco displayed prominently on the living room sideboard in the home of Liang Royuan the 50yearold deputy leader of the state farms July 1 Production Brigade whose cousin emigrated to the United States Otherwise one of the main factors pulling the refugees together seemed to be a common loathing for the Government in Hanoi which confiscated the homes and property of many of the refugees before loading them aboard trains and forcing them to ford rivers at the Chinese frontier Mr Liang said that his family had lived in Vietnam for three generations after his grandfather left China in the 1920s to seek a better living under the French in Indochina When it came time to fight the French we made our contributions and later against the Americans too he said Then after Ho Chi Minh died the Vietnamese party became hostile to China and threw us out How can we be anything but bitter

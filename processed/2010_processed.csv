companionate marriage norm along later age childbirth ross rightly worry anything resemble stable family life continue unravel half rate outofwedlock birth divorce alarmingly high level continue rise worry problem well obvious question samesex marriage problem hidden behind argument kind populist notion samesex marriage elite project elites dont need project thankyou much time something leave behind argument need elite society set well example plebe well part life least arent theyre defer childbirth stay married rest perhaps argument paternalist one masquerade populist one say problem isnt elites arent behave well problem elites behave well way plebes cant imitate arent smart economically resourceful enough wont imitate elite appear culturally alien elite need adopt enough manner

meanwhile seem pretty clear upper class successful adjustment new post1960s reality depend extent relatively high abortion rate play significant role late marriage later childbearing obviously dont think abortion wrong doesnt constitute problem coincidentally upper class also prochoice segment american society think abortion wrong course dependence practice constitutes deep corruption heart

antiabortion cause finally question divorce outofwedlock birth millman right upper class already set relatively good example rest country think could stand set decent standard could embrace instance kind divorce law reform brad wilcox argue last year national affair would throw legal hurdle wouldbe divorcee inject strong moral element divorce proceeding without repeal nofault divorce outright could champion public policy intervention disfavor unwed parenthood tax incentive favor married couple heavier sanction deadbeat father etc wouldnt kind populist masquerade millman suggest im urge

debate yesterday new york time paul j curran lewis e lehrman republican candidate governor new york crime q crime issue specifically would governorcurran im candidate year election go back time suppose one good who experience criminal justice area fight crime federal prosecutor five year head sic four first thing need do quickly new governor put death penalty book would change immediately method jury selection state method take day day week month sometimes pick jury federal system pick jury even complex case many defendant day two day would free judge try many case course lessen plea bargaining would revitalize state commission investigation get back mandate one mandate statute examine organize crime report people lehrman police believe principal deterrent street new york city street every city state new york 1977 example approximately 6600 police officer duty one moment time new york city today approximately 6000 weve 10 percent reduction number police officer new york city term office promise double police think time u fact expand police officer every community prey upon violent criminal whether new york city downtown major city upstate indeed suburban rural community case may governor state new york unify court system approximately 1000 judge appoint 200 governor would privilege appoint five seven judge court appeal court appeal make decision past year take beyond liberal ruling decision supreme court unite state speak specifically right counsel suppression evidence suppression confession believe evidence obtain good faith police admissible court tax cut q mr lehrman youve talk whole series tax cut think need new york state id like know could identify area within state government beyond home relief cut youre propose money tax cut would come lehrman first propose tax cut coincident requirement constitution state new york balance budget year governor require make fiveyear forecast revenue next five year hugh carey forecast 1 billion increase annual revenue present law without new tax increase pass frankly believe job governor ive say publicly hold line public spending belief part 1 billion increase revenue year use fund gradual systematic reduction tax rate work new yorkers middle income new yorkers new york state longer competitive 50 percent business leave new york state 1970s go right next door thats right go pennsylvania new jersey connecticut order keep job business capital saving new york state competitive tax code period eight year recommend reform tax code state new york every significant respect curran say consistently goal governor come office next january try cut tax cut spending insofar possible state income tax need cut possibly cut mr lehrman past promise would eight year without regard spending thats think part company issue think really get see number youre go utmost cut many many thing mandate state period time point whole matter cant possibly promise people new york specific income tax cut eightyear time frame think mr lehrman concede unless know revenue go unless youre prepare look exactly program youre go make substantial saving q would go save money curran would try utmost think would cut every agency government monies expenditures undergo annually think do ive do past lehrman ive make two concrete proposal know first area new york state welfare mental health q home relief right lehrman yes think substantial area equitable fair humane application costsaving technique secondly ive discuss problem mental institution state new york specifically 1955 believe 93000 patient mental institution state new york today estimate approximately 21000 patient mental institution interest patient load mental institution decline approximately 75 80 percent budget institution triple since 1972 single staff reduction knowledge basis research weve able mental institution state new york therefore believe vast amount reform possibility mental institution state new york governor carey recognize republican assemblyman senator recognize waste misallocation resource mental institution propose conversion prison certain case example gowanda gowanda mental institution erie county proposal conversion suffolk county pilgrim center q oppose lehrman indeed q oppose want save money lehrman fact endorse conversion gowanda center erie county know object conversion suffolk county specific reason believe divide single property institution two principal public purpose believe age mentally infirm inmate mental institution side side violent felon prison exactly governor carey propose pilgrim center curran think candidate term conversion think candidate least far ive read oppose conversion pilgrim state lehrman oppose im record oppose primarily residential area residence practically facility right around facility dont think make sense point q problem basic philosophy convert mental hospital prison qualification meet curran believe good do think governor legislature look overall state picture pick place go best school funding q court appeal rule state obligation equalize spending rich poor school district either gentleman believe state even though court rule obligation equalize spending curran think state obligation try see spend equal extent think court appeal decision sound one reaffirmed notion local control education good state one thing great deal trouble language court appeal decision quality education almost always assess strict dollar think thats fallacy extent q would willing least consider formula involve cut state aid community curran well think redo education formula along line ive suggested youre probably go result community go end get per student go get less q narrow question willing say whether youd cut aid wealthy school district lehrman dont think do see think economic growth fact alternative equal right abortion q short answer two divisive question one statewide equal right amendment stand also medicaid financing abortion curran let answer second one first im oppose use taxpayer money fund abortion request demand q statewide equal right amendment curran far know statute book new york mandate equal right think present situation appropriate equal right mandate kind statute lehrman dont believe taxpayer force subsidize unrestricted abortion demand statewide era mean principle understand purpose one practical problem would take least three year get state era might even take substantially long court appeal q think present court curran problem court appeal decision criminal justice area indeed court appeal recently reverse know united state supreme court child pornography area go one way strike statute new york effect strike statute united state supreme court say wrong think theyve gotten bogged case technicality look sufficiently issue guilt innocence find way uphold conviction rather reverse lehrman think supreme court decision appeal pornographic use child movie otherwise perfect example excess appeal court state new york carry procedural technicality point whereby endanger public safety community unique case though true supreme court unite state overrule court appeal pornography issue equally true decision court appeal take believe good conscience wrongly confession de facto make virtually inadmissible certain criminal trial state court new york evidence obtain good faith policeman performance duty suppress violent felon effectively prosecute public service commission q either specific idea public service commission act regard utility curran sense public service commission tough time keep increase come fast apply one increase theyve rule prior one situation dont today certainly panacea situation think one would need governor appoint public service commission people steadfastly commit see utilty cost hold insofar possible lehrman psc criticize anything think one problem insufficiently businesslike cite example shoreham nuclear power project long island represent construction project absolutely control every significant judgment cost overrun refer nine mile point oswego propose cost 300 million dollar may cost three billion suggest even raise question whether private monopoly fact well manage doubt westway q westway curran im westway lehrman im oppose westway q lehrman im oppose westway im build west side highway im oppose westway could easily 4 billion project pay taxpayer could 500 million efficient highway construct properly curran let speak agree lew one proposition politician kick around long litigation fought year ago approve congress think 76 thereabouts tuition tax credit q see state obligation private parochial elementary secondary schoolslehrman im tuition tax credit federal state level curran would tuition tax credit bill albany state level think make sense large amount would help governor carey q think governor carey hows do curran well think particularly last four year governor carey do job governor way think hasnt work

legislature year far tell substantially run state whether budget anything else democrat republicans get together try agree program lehrman extent concur governor give legislature strong leadership

frontrunner second relate problem new hampshire mr romney something homestate advantage always significantly outperform national number cant downplay expectation iowa new hampshire expect much chance see giuliani rudolph w mean mr huntsman must perform well state even mr romney weaken poor show iowa event campaign hed long way drop become vulnerable new hampshire well thus mr huntsman campaign predicate something longshot parlay mr huntsman probably firepower overcome mr romney instead need help another candidate someone weaken mr romney point could lose new hampshire problem also need

mike huckabee 2008 pat robertson secondplace show 1996 win mr bachmann might thus little damage mr romney new hampshire state hand candidate like tim pawlenty iowa someone traditional credential

expectation would probably reverse mr gingrichs momentum might constrain point would run away race meanwhile mr huntsman would mind ron paul do relatively well iowa since mr paul also poll relatively well new hampshire could complicate mr gingrichs mr romneys paths victory even absent specific scenario permutation mr romney lose new hampshire candidate beat lock nomination either mr gingrich mr

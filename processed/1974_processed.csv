replacement reproduction replacement reproduction reach would take additional half population control wont achieve without cultural change occur little help century population stop grow reach zero population growth common confusion relationship reach replacement fertility mean generation replace zero population growth several generation alive one time grow population disproportionately large number young people replacement level reproduction must maintain 50 70 year population stop grow look demographic transition solve population problem therefore must overlook economic reality industrialization constraint impose upon development resource availability environmental fragility orassuming limit could overcomethe long time necessary transition take effect figure transition take
